"Lebanon Lebanese Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil gestures to his supporters during a rally to show support for FPM founder Michel Aoun, near the presidential palace in Baabda, near Beirut, Lebanon, October 16, 2016. Photo by Reuters Lebanons Minister of Foreign Affairs Gebran Bassil says the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah shares the victory of Michel Aoun in securing the countrys presidency. Aoun, a strong Hezbollah ally, was chosen by Lebanese lawmakers as the countrys president on Monday. Addressing a large number of people who had converged at a square in Beirut to celebrate Aouns election, Bassil, who is also the head of the Free Patriotic Movement FPM and Aouns soninlaw, said his movement never doubted Hezbollahs loyalty and honesty. Aoun is the founder of the FPM. He said Aouns victory was based on his own perseverance as well as the positions adopted by Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who is Hezbollahs secretary general. In a phone call on the same day, Nasrallah congratulated Aoun on his election as the head of the Lebanese state. This image, taken in the southern suburbs of Beirut on October 31, 2016, shows people celebrating the election of Michel Aoun as the new president of Lebanon. Nasrallah endorsed Aoun last week, advising Lebanese political factions to set aside their differences in order to fill the presidential void in the Arab country. Lebanon had been without a president for over two years amid political bickering in the parliament. After the election, Aoun vowed in a speech to the parliament that he would spare no effort in trying to bring about the liberation of Lebanese territories occupied by Israel. He said his top priority would be to strengthen the army in order for it to become capable of defending the country against all threats to its independence and sovereignty. Hezbollah has been defending Lebanon against Israeli aggression since the movements inception, including during a fullfledged Israeli war in 2006. This item is being updated. Loading ... ",state

"Military An American soldier talks with Saudi troops. File photo by the US Army A US congressman has warned that American troops could be prosecuted for providing military support to the Saudi war on Yemen. Ted Lieu made the warning in a letter to US Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, saying the US governments denial of target selection for Saudi airstrikes in Yemen does not excuse Washington from legal responsibilities. I find it deeply troubling that the US apparently has no advanced knowledge of what targets will be struck by jets that are refueled by US personnel with US tankers, Lieu said in his letter. The US would appear to be violating LOAC laws of armed conflict and international standards by engaging in such direct military operations if US personnel are not aware if targets are civilian or military, if the loss of life and property are disproportional, or if the operation is even militarily necessary, he noted. A Yemeni boy walks past a mural depicting a US drone and reading Why did you kill my family. Photo by AFP Pointing to the 18month involvement of the US in Saudi war on the Yemeni people, the Democratic congressman stressed that Washington had knowledge of a bombardment campaign hitting civilian targets, including schools and hospitals, multiple times. US personnel are now at legal risk of being investigated and potentially prosecuted for committing war crimes. Under international law, a person can be found guilty of aiding and abetting war crimes. Under US law, a person can be found guilty for conspiring to commit war crimes, Lieu wrote. The Pentagon has been providing logistic and surveillance support to Saudi Arabia in its military aggression against Yemen, the kingdoms impoverished southern neighbor, which has killed more than 10,000 Yemenis since its onset in March 2015. The unprovoked war started by a coalition of Saudiallies in an attempt to undermine the Houthi Ansarullah movement and reinstate former Yemeni President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, a staunch ally of the Riyadh regime. Washington has on several occasions criticized the Saudi regime for its crimes against humanity in Yemen, but has shown no sign of ending its support for Riyadh. US Representative Ted Lieu of California addresses delegates on the fourth and final day of the Democratic National Convention at Wells Fargo Center on July 28, 2016 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Photo by AFP In August, the US State Department approved the sale of more than 130 Abrams tanks, 20 armored recovery vehicles and other equipment worth about 1.15 billion to Saudi Arabia. Saudiled bombardments have struck hospitals, markets and other places where civilians gather. In September, Amnesty International reported that a US manufactured bomb had been used in a Saudi strike against a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Yemens northwestern province of Hajjah which claimed the lives of 19 people. In October, more than 140 people lost their lives and over 525 others sustained injuries after Saudi military aircraft struck a hall in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, where rows of people were attending a funeral.

"Interviews The FBI probe was inevitable because of the metastasizing of the links and the connections that the Clinton Foundation had, most specifically and grievously to Saudi Arabia, to Qatar, says American analyst Scott Bennett. The ongoing federal investigation into the Clinton Foundation was expected because of the Clinton familys ties with US enemies, says Scott Bennett, a former US Army psychological warfare officer. The FBI has been probing possible paytoplay schemes at the family foundation for over a year now and is likely to press charges against it, Fox News reported Wednesday, citing informed officials. Bennett told Press TV on Friday that the probe was inevitable because of the metastasizing of the links and the connections that the Clinton Foundation had, most specifically and grievously to Saudi Arabia, to Qatar, and many other countries blacklisted by Washington. It was revealed on Friday that the Clinton Foundation took a 1 million gift from Qatar during Hillary Clintons tenure as the US secretary of state, without her informing the State Department. Hillary decided to not inform the department of the transaction, despite signing an ethics agreement with regards to the foundation when she became secretary of state. According to the foundations website, Qatar has so far given the Clintons a total of between 1 million and 5 million over the years. Aside from Qatar, Saudi Arabia has also been one of the Clinton Foundations biggest donors. It became known in 2008 that the kingdom had given them between 10 million and 25 million. So those terrorist entities, which have been labeled as the enemies of the United States, have been appearing as Clinton Foundation donors, Bennett said. That is a serious crime, it is treason, it is corruption, it is bribery of officials, said the analyst. Bennett argued that all the leaks and investigations concerning the Clinton family were coming from those personnel in the American government who have had enough. They have stepped up, they have released emails, they have hacked into their own computers and in some cases they have provided it to WikiLeaks, he added. Whistleblowing website WikiLeaks has released thousands of Hillarys campaign chairman and top aide John Podestas emails since last month, exposing some of the wellkept secrets surrounding the Clinton family and Hillary Clintons bid for the White House. Bennett predicted that the case would most probably lead to indictments and some people would be arrested as early as this weekend. Loading ... ",state

Photo by AP Britains Prince Charles and his wife Camilla have arrived in Bahrain on a threenation tour of the Persian Gulf states amid strong criticism of Londons continued arms sales to the repressive regime in Manama. The plane carrying the British royals touched down at Sakhir Air Base in central Bahrain on Tuesday on the last leg of the tour, which had already taken them to Oman and the United Arab Emirates. They were received by Bahrains Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifah and then taken to a nearby palace to meet with the countrys King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifah. Since 2011, the United Kingdom has sold 55 million dollars worth of arms to Bahrain. The year saw the eruption of peaceful antiregime protests on the island. London has been under fire by international rights organizations for selling military equipment to Manama, which is involved in a harsh and deadly crackdown on opposition activists. It was reported late last month that the UK will open a massive permanent military base in Bahrain and deploy warships to the Persian Gulf. A Bahraini protester shouts slogans during clashes with regime forces in the village of Sitra, south of Manama, on February 12, 2015. Photo by AFP The military base, which is the first such facility being opened by Britain in 40 years in the Persian Gulf region, will be launched next month, Britains Express newspaper reported. Britain will station around 600 military forces at the Royal Navy Facility and will deploy its warships to patrol the surrounding waters and guard oil and gas shipments in the waters. When Britain kicked off the project in 2014, Defense Secretary Michael Fallon described it as a permanent expansion of the Royal Navys footprint in the Persian Gulf. The project has bypassed the parliament. According to data released by the UK Trade and Investment in September, the UK government has become the worlds second biggest arms dealer, with bulk of its weapons fueling deadly conflicts in the Middle East.

"Politics US actor Robert De Niro Photo by AFP Hollywood actor Robert De Niro, who had criticized Americans for putting an idiot like Donald Trump in a position where he might become the US president, now says he respects him because he is the presidentelect of the United States. Before the November 8 presidential election, De Niro had been enlisted along with several other actors to speak in a nonpartisan video encouraging Americans to vote in. But the 73yearold actor defied script and delivered a scathing rebuke of Trump. Hes so blatantly stupid. Hes a punk, hes a dog, hes a pig ... a mutt who ... doesnt do his homework, doesnt care. Hes an idiot. Colin Powell said it best Hes a national disaster. Hes an embarrassment to this country, the Raging Bull actor said. It makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this fool, this bozo, has wound up where he has, he stated. He talks how he wants to punch people in the face Well, Id like to punch him in the face, De Niro said. But after the Republican presidential nominee was declared the 45th presidentelect on Wednesday, De Niro clarified that he would no longer like to punch Trump because the man was elected to the highest seat in political office. The veteran actor, however, told Jimmy Kimmel on his latenight show on ABC News that he is not feeling good after Trumps victory, which caused protests and student walkouts across the country. Protesters on Wednesday slammed Trumps divisive campaign rhetoric against immigrants, refugees, Muslims and ethnic minorities. De Niro said he has to respect Trump because of his new position  which means no punching. Are you still going to punch Donald Trump in the face Kimmel asked the actor, because you could now get arrested for that, I think. I cant do that now, hes the President, replied De Niro.

"Persian Gulf This photo shows antiregime protesters taking part in a demonstration in the village of Musalla, Bahrain, on November 11, 2016. Bahrainis have taken to the streets in several villages and towns in support of senior Shia cleric Sheikh Isa Qassim. On Friday, a mass protest was held near Imam Sadiq mosque in the village of Diraz, the hometown of the cleric. The demonstrators condemned Manamas continued ban on holding Friday prayers in the village. On June 20, Bahraini authorities stripped the 79yearold cleric of his citizenship, less than a week after suspending the alWefaq National Islamic Society, the countrys main opposition bloc, and dissolving the Islamic Enlightenment Institution, founded by Qassim, and the opposition alRisala Islamic Association. People in the villages of Shakhoura and Abu Saiba also demonstrated in solidarity with Sheikh Qassem and the political detainees despite tightened security measures. Similar antiregime demonstrations were held in the villages of Maameer, Karbabad, Shahrakan, Sehla alJanoubia and Musalla as well as the town of Aali and the island of Nabih Saleh. The protesters also condemned the Al Khalifah regime for its persecution of the Shia community.

"Politics US Senator Bernie Sanders Former US Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has threatened Presidentelect Donald Trump, warning that his camp will be Trumps worst nightmare if he goes after minorities in America. If Donald Trump takes peoples anger and turns it against Muslims, Hispanics, African Americans and women, we will be his worst nightmare, the Vermont senator wrote on his Twitter page on Thursday. The 74yearold senator had earlier issued a statement after the New York businessmans victory in the US election on November 8, promising to work with him on certain issues but also to oppose him should he pursue divisive and discriminatory policies. To the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him, Sanders said. To the degree that he pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic and antienvironment policies, we will vigorously oppose him, he added. During the primaries, Sanders ran a close race with Clinton and promised to continue the fight all the way until the Democratic National Convention in June, where the partys nominee was going to be named. Towards the end of the race, however, Sanders changed his tone and bowed out in favor of Clinton. He also appeared next to her during the DNC and supported his party opponent in the Democratic campaigns. On July 12, 2016, Sanders formally endorsed Clinton after facing mounting pressure from major Democratic figures, including outgoing US President Barack Obama himself. US Republican presidentelect Donald Trump delivers his acceptance speech during his election night event at the New York Hilton Midtown in the early morning hours of November 9, 2016 in New York City. Photo by AFP On Tuesday, Trump stunned the world by defeating heavily favored Clinton in the presidential election, sending the United States on a new, uncertain path. Trump rode a wave of anger toward the elite US establishment to win the White House race against Clinton, a longtime Washington insider. The New York businessman garnered 290 electoral votes in the 2016 US election, while his rival and the former secretary of state received 232 votes despite winning the popular vote. Thousands of people since then have rallied in cities across the US to protest against Trumps presidential election victory, condemning his controversial campaign rhetoric against Muslims, immigrants, women and other groups. This is while Trump said in his victory speech he would be president for all Americans. It is time for us to come together as one united people, he said. The real estate moguls election campaign had been marred by his disparaging remarks against minorities in the US. His comments include a call to ban all Muslims from coming to America as well as stopping Mexican migrants by building a long wall along the USMexico border. He has also sought for a database to track Muslims across the United States and said that the US would have absolutely no choice but to close down mosques. Trumps proposal was widely condemned by Muslim and human rights groups as well as his Democratic rivals and many of his Republican proponents who describe the proposal as divisive, counterproductive and contrary to American values.

Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif denounced the bomb attack, calling on authorities to speed up the rescue operation. Reports say some 500 people were in the shrine when the bomb went off. Every day, around sunset, there is a dhamaal a Sufi ritual dance here, and there are large numbers of people who come for this, said Nawaz Ali, the shrines custodian.

"Politics FBI Director James Comey AFP file photo Hillary Clintons top advisers blame FBI Director James Comey for the Democrats bruising loss to Presidentelect Donald Trump. Navin Nayak, the head of the Clinton campaigns opinion research division, sent an email to senior staffers Thursday, outlining early signals as to why the candidate lost the November 8 presidential election, POLITICO reported on Friday. We believe that we lost this election in the last week, said Nayaks email, which was published by POLITICO.  Comeys letter in the last 11 days of the election both helped depress our turnout and also drove away some of our critical support among collegeeducated white voters  particularly in the suburbs. We also think Comeys 2nd letter, which was intended to absolve Sec. Clinton, actually helped to bolster Trumps turnout, he continued. The letter also highlighted several other challenges the Clinton team faced throughout the campaign, including a desire for change after two terms by a Democratic president and the reluctance of some Americans to vote for a female candidate. Hillary Clinton makes a concession speech after being defeated by Donald Trump in New York on November 9, 2016. Photo by AFP Despite those challenges, Nayak said, Clinton was on course to win until the last week, when everything changed and the momentum began to shift in favor of Trump. Voters who decided in the last week broke for Trump by a larger margin 4247. These numbers were even more exaggerated in the key battleground states, he said. The FBI director angered Democrats late in October by announcing in a letter to Congress that the agency had uncovered new emails connected to the Clinton email investigation. Just over a week later, Comey notified Congress that Clinton would not face charges over the newly discovered messages. Nayak said Comeys letters encouraged Trump supporters and depressed the turnout for Clinton on Election Day. There is no question that a week from Election Day, Sec. Clinton was poised for a historic win. In the end, less than 110K votes out of tens of millions cast on Election Day made the difference in this race, he wrote. In the end, Nayak concluded, late breaking developments in the race proved one hurdle too many for us to overcome. Clinton had been leading Trump throughout the campaign in most of the polls except for the last week of the election when she lost ground to Trump.",state

General John Nicholson said Saturday that the airstrike on the village of Buz Kandahari, just outside the northern city of Kunduz on Thursday, would be probed. Three Taliban leaders were supposed to be targeted in the raid, but the forces met significant enemy fire from multiple locations and called for help from a US aircraft, which left 33 civilians, including 17 children, dead. An initial investigation has determined that efforts near Kunduz on November 3 to defend Afghan National Defense and Security Forces likely resulted in civilian casualties, Nicholson said in a statement. We will work with our Afghan partners to investigate and determine the facts and we will work with the government of Afghanistan to provide assistance. The targets were highranking elements of the Takfiri group that were supposed to be hit in their houses, according to Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman Dawlat Waziri. They werent ordinary people who had gathered. They were leading fighting in Kunduz. They were the commanders of their military commission, Waziri said. Taliban militants were removed from power following the 2001 USled invasion of Afghanistan, but they have stepped up their activities in recent months, attempting to overrun several provinces.

"Interviews US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton stands with President Barack Obama during an election eve rally on November 7, 2016 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The American people have repudiated the foreign policy of President Barack Obama and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton which was a complete disgrace for the United States, according to James Fetzer, an American scholar and political analyst. Professor Fetzer made the remarks in a phone interview with Press TV on Monday, days after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump stunned the world by defeating the heavilyfavored Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, in the November 8 election. During the election campaign, Trump repeatedly expressed his willingness to work with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other leaders in order to resolve global problems, including the issue of Daesh terrorism, which he has blamed on the policies of the Obama administration. On the other hand, Clinton has shown eagerness to confront Russia and continue the interventionist policies US administrations have practiced since 9/11. Professor Fetzer said that Clinton was behind the massacre of Libya, the butchery of Benghazi, the transfer of weapons to rebels in Syria. More than five years after the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi, Libya has become a failed state, with the central government holding no sway over the country, and Africas wealthiest nation has become a haven for terrorist organizations. And since 2011, the United States and its allies have been sponsoring terrorists wreaking havoc in Syria. Professor Fetzer stated that Clinton was being advised by Israeli intelligence, telling her how to conduct American foreign policy. It was a complete disgrace. The American people have repudiated the foreign policy of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, the scholar said. Donald Trump is going to restore a measure of sanity. He is going to end the wars in the Middle East. He is going to restore the reputation of the United States for integrity, and dealing with the international community, he noted. He respects Russia as should any president of the United States, where Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton fell miserably short, the analyst pointed out.

"Society Naza says the upcoming full moon will appear up to 14 percent bigger and 30 percent brighter than usual. The brightest moon in almost 69 years will be lighting up the night sky this week in a treat for star watchers around the globe. The phenomenon, known as the supermoon, will reach its zenith in Asia and the South Pacific on Monday night. It will then reach its most brightest mode in North America before dawn on Monday. Across the international dateline in New Zealand, it will reach its brightest after midnight on Tuesday local time. If skies are clear, the upcoming full moon will appear up to 14 percent bigger and 30 percent brighter than usual, according to NASA. This image shows a near full moon in Aravica, Arizona, on October 13, 2016. Photo by AFP The moons distance from Earth varies because it is in an eggshaped, not circular, orbit around the planet. Since the moons orbit is elliptical, one side perigee is about 50,000 kilometers closer to Earth than the other apogee. The word syzygy is the scientific term used for when the Earth, sun, and moon line up as the moon orbits Earth. When perigeesyzygy of the Earthmoonsun system occurs and the moon is on the opposite side of the Earth from the sun, we get a perigee moon, which is more commonly known as supermoon. This coincidence already happened one time on October 16. On November 14 and December 14, it happens again, as the moon becomes full on the same day as perigee. On November 14, it becomes full within about two hours of perigeearguably making it an extra supermoon. The full moon of November 14 is not only the closest full moon of 2016 but also the closest full moon to date in the 21st century. The next time a full moon comes this close to Earth will be November 25, 2034. Loading ... ",state
"Politics Vintage cars are parked in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace in London, part of a display of 90 historic Britishbuilt motor vehicles to commemorate Queen Elizabeth IIs 90th birthday. Photo by AFP Thousands of Britons have signed a petition to express their outrage over Queen Elizabeths use of 369 million in taxpayers money to repair the Buckingham Palace. More than 94,000 people had signed the petition as of Sunday, two days after the government of Prime Minister Theresa May allowed the royal family to repair the palace with public funds. The UK Parliament should discuss the petition when it hits the 100,000 mark. On Friday, the Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond granted the 90yearold Queen a 66percent rise in funding required for the palaces refurbishment over the next 10 years. The money would be used to replace cables, pipes and boilers installed 60 years ago to prevent a catastrophic event that might destroy the palace, according to Master of the Queens Household Tony JohnstoneBurt. Petitioners argued that the royals should foot the massive bill themselves given the vast extent of their wealth. The Crown and its estates should be made to fund its own renovations, wrote Mark Johnson, who posted the petition. Protesters said the money could be used to mend the faltering National Health Service NHS or help families get more affordable homes amid a housing crisis.

Photo by AFP It is wholly unreasonable to cut the benefits of the sick and disabled, take away housing benefits from the poor, and then pay for this, said one signatory of the petition. The antimonarchy campaign group Republic also took issue with the announcement, denouncing it as a disgrace. Whats worse is this appalling increase is only a small part of the annual cost of the Royal family, which we put at 334m, said Graham Smith, a member of the group. Over the past years, the UK government has been generous towards the royal family despite cutting billions in public money. Under former treasury minister George Osborne, the Queens sovereign grant for 2016 was increased by 7 percent, bringing the total to 42.9 million a year. Now the annual grant would be inflated by twothirds, rising to 76 million in 2017. The grant is financed by the profit coming from the royal familys 350,000 acres of land across the UK. Loading ...

In a post on his Twitter account, his son, Adam, said that his father was transferred for the third time to a police hospital after suffering from chest pain. The 52yearold president of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights has been repeatedly detained for organizing prodemocracy demonstrations and publishing Twitter posts deemed insulting to the Bahraini authorities. He was pardoned for health reasons last year, but was rearrested on June 13 following an intensive search of his house in the northwest of the country. Reports suggest he has been subjected to harassment in jail. Thousands of antiregime protesters have held numerous demonstrations in Bahrain on an almost daily basis ever since a popular uprising began in the kingdom on February 14, 2011. They are demanding that the Al Khalifah dynasty relinquish power and a just system representing all Bahrainis be established. On March 14, 2011, troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were deployed to Bahrain to assist the Manama government in its crackdown on peaceful protesters.

"Iraq Iraqi firefighters work to extinguish the fire caused by a car bomb explosion at a gas station near the city of Hilla, November 24, 2016. A car bomb has reportedly exploded south of the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, killing around 100 people, mostly Shia pilgrims. According to security sources, a truck loaded with explosives went off on Thursday at a gas station in the Shomali village in the suburbs of the city of alHilla, located 120 kilometers 75 miles southeast of the capital Baghdad and around 80 kilometers 50 miles from Karbala. Reports say most of the victims were Iranian nationals. The photo shows the site of a blast at a gas station near Hilla, south of the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, November 24, 2016. The incident occurred at a time when buses packed with Shia pilgrims were parked at the gas station. The people were returning from Arbaeen mourning rituals in the holy city of Karbala. At least seven buses with pilgrims were inside the petrol station at the time, an unnamed police lieutenant colonel told AFP. People carry away the bodies of victims from the site of a bomb attack near Hilla, Iraq, November 24, 2016. AFP also quoted an unnamed police intelligence source as saying that those buses were loaded with Iranians, Bahrainis and Iraqis. Ambulances and civil defense are on their way to the site. The Takfiri Daesh terrorist group claimed responsibility for the deadly bombing. In recent weeks, Daesh has resorted to similar acts of violence in areas outside its control in a desperate attempt to undermine a large Iraqi battle aimed at liberating the northern city of Mosul, the terror groups last remaining foothold in the country. Iran wont waver in backing Iraq Hours after the incident, Irans Foreign Ministry spokesman strongly condemned the fatal terrorist blast, expressing sympathy with the Iraqi government and nation as well as all the families of the victims. Touching on reports that Iranian citizens were among the victims, Bahram Qassemi said, The Foreign Ministry and the Islamic Republic of Irans Embassy in Baghdad are investigating the issue with seriousness and will take necessary measures in that regard. The Iranian official also stressed that such preplanned and savage assaults emanate from the desperation of the terrorists, who are taking successive blows on the battlefield. These brutal and inhumane acts will not affect the Iraqi government and nations determination and the Islamic Republic of Irans support for the oppressed Iraqi people in the unrelenting fight against terrorism, Qassemi said.

Photo by IRNA Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani says the European Union can play a significant role in the settlement of the Syrian crisis and the campaign against terrorism. Larijani made the remarks in a meeting with visiting Finnish President Sauli Niinist in Tehran on Wednesday. He said that Iran supports political solutions to crises in the Middle East, including the conflict in Syria, while some extraregional players as well as regional sponsors of terrorist groups sabotaged diplomatic solutions through adopting wrong approaches. The top Iranian parliamentarian also warned against the spillover of terrorism to other regions across the world. Unfortunately, military intervention by outsiders in regional issues and adopting a military approach and double standards on terrorism have led to a rise in the number of terrorist groups and contributed to their activities, Larijani said. He also blamed the extremist and deviated ideology of Wahhabism for the spread of terrorism in the region, stressing that neither Sunnis nor Shias support terrorist or extremist acts. Elsewhere in his remarks, Larijani welcomed the expansion of ties between Tehran and Helsinki. The Finnish official, for his part, called for the further promotion of ties between his country and Iran.

The Syrian Arab Republic has repeatedly denied all allegations circulated by some Western circles and their agents about the use of chemical poisonous materials by Syrian sides, like chlorine gas, during military operations against terrorists, Syrias Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried by the official SANA news agency on Wednesday. The statement came four days after an international inquiry blamed Syrian government forces for a toxic gas attack in Qminas in northwestern Idlib province on March 16, 2015. The accusation was made in the fourth report from the 13monthlong probe by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. However, the Syrian Foreign Ministry statement said that there was no tangible evidence for the inquirys findings. Syria has repeatedly warned against repercussions of politicizing this issue regarding the credibility of the work of international relevant sides, the ministry added. It also stressed that the Syrian government remains committed to all its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention, a multilateral treaty that bans chemical weapons and requires their destruction. Daesh has frequently used chemical weapons in both in Syria and Iraq, where the Takfiri terrorist group is mainly active. A report by the SyrianAmerican Medical Society published back in March said that Daesh had carried out more than 160 attacks involving poisonous or asphyxiating agents, such as sarin, chlorine, and mustard gas since the beginning of the conflict in Syria. The report added that over 1,490 people had been killed in the chemical attacks. Since March 2011, Syria has been hit by militancy it blames on some Western states and their regional allies.

The analyst also expressed concern about what will happen once Hillary Clinton becomes president, as she has a very close relationship with Israel, and very close relationship with Netanyahu, and Israel may very well feel empowered to take even bolder steps in what has been frankly incremental genocide against Palestinians.

"Interviews Syria should be able to choose its allies in the battle against Daesh, says American political analyst James Petras. The Pentagons plan to launch an offensive against the Daesh ISIL terrorist group in Syria is only aimed at undermining a successful attempt by the Syrian government and its allies to defeat the terror group, says James Petras, an American political commentator. US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told NBC News on Wednesday that the Pentagon is planning a ground offensive to oust Daesh from the Syrian city of Raqqah, the terror groups stronghold in the country. Carter, who was in Iraq earlier this week amid the ongoing battle to retake the city of Mosul from Daesh, said the Raqqah offensive would begin when Iraqs second largest city is cleared. He claimed that US forces wont be directly involved in any of the operations. This is a ploy to have the US in northern Syria, Petras said, arguing that the US was seeking to undermine international efforts to defeat Daesh in a bid to reinforce its own foothold in the conflictridden country. I dont believe that the attack on Raqqah is a positive move because I think it brings the US closer to its policy of establishing a nofly zone in northern Syria which will directly affect the efforts of the Syrian government and its alliesIran and Russiato defend the country. The analyst noted that Raqqah is a problem for the Syrian people and Damascus should be allowed to choose its allies in the battle. Petras went on to note that Carters remarks bear similarities to US Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clintons plans for a conflagration in the Middle East. The ongoing Western efforts in Syria have a different nature. Washington and its allies have come under fire for openly seeking to remove President Bashar alAssad from power. Carters claim that US ground forces will have no part in the fight against Daesh came at a time when more than 5,000 American soldiers were stationed in Iraq, tasked with providing training and intelligence to Iraqi forces.

Via AP The UN refugee agency, also known as the UNHCR, says the number of refugees who died in the Mediterranean Sea on their way to Europe in 2016 has reached an alltime high. We can confirm that at least 3,800 people have been reported dead or missing in the Mediterranean Sea so far this year, making the death toll in 2016 the highest ever recorded, said the UN refugee agency spokesman, William Spindler, on Wednesday. The alarming surge, which surpassed the death toll of 3,771 for 2015, comes despite a considerable decline in the number of refugees crossing the Mediterranean in 2016. More than a million people reached Europe via the Mediterranean in 2016, while fewer than 330,000 crossings have been reported so far this year. The number of refugees heading to Europe has declined as the European Union in March signed a controversial deal with Turkey aimed at stemming the flow of refugees into the continent by forcing those deported from the EU to either be located in Turkey or go back to the original country of departure. Since then, the route between Libya and Italy across the central Mediterranean has become the main way as pathways to Greece have been closed down. According to the agency, the likelihood of perishing in the shorter route between Turkey and Greece was one in 88, while one death for every 47 arrivals was reported in the most perilous route between Libya and Italy in 2016. The UNHCR attributed the surge mainly to the overcrowded lower quality vessels, flimsy inflatable rafts often used by smugglers. In this October 21, 2016 photo provided by SeaWatch aid group refugees sit in an inflatable boat off the Libyan coast in the Mediterranean Sea. Via AP 25 refugees found dead in Mediterranean Sea, MSF says Earlier on Wednesday, Doctors Without Borders, known as the MSF by its French acronym, said 25 bodies had been retrieved from a refugee boat during a rescue operation in the Mediterranean. The MSF said its ship, Bourbon Argos, found the bodies aboard the vessel 26 nautical miles off Libya late on Tuesday. The vessel was carrying 107 survivors. The victims had apparently been burned, suffocated or drowned. The recovery operation, which took place with the help of a team from the Berlinbased nongovernmental organization SeaWatch, took a long time as the boat was flooded with a mixture of fuel and seawater. The mixture of water and fuel was so foul that we could not stay on the boat for long periods. It was horrible, said Michele Telaro, the MSF project leader. The MSF also saved 139 people aboard another dinghy on Tuesday. SeaWatch recovered a body in another operation. The Italian Coast Guard reported that 500 refugees were rescued from overcrowded boats on Tuesday.

"Egypt The file photo shows Mohammed Badie, a senior figure of Egypts now outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. Egypts Appeals Court has upheld a draconian life sentence that was handed down to Mohammed Badie, the spiritual leader of the now outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. The court ruled on Wednesday that Badie, along with 36 others, who served as ministers in the government led by the countrys first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, who was supported by the Brotherhood between 2011 and 2013, deserved life behind bars for inciting violence and murder. Badie has been viewed as a key element in the Muslim Brotherhood, a party which operated under numerous restrictions during the era of the countrys former dictator, Hosni Mubarak. The senior Brotherhood figure played a major role in the popular uprising that led to the ouster of Mubarak in January 2011. During the Wednesday session, the court also upheld the death sentences for 10 other individuals, who had been tried in absentia. A criminal court in 2014 tried 47 defendants, who include former youth and supplies ministers, for charges of murder, attempted murder, resisting authorities, assaulting policemen, sabotage, and blocking a main road in the Nile Delta city of Qalyubia. The general legal procedure against the Muslim Brotherhood began in July 2013, when Morsi was ousted in a military coup. The head of the Egyptian armed forces, Abdel Fattah elSisi, came to power afterward. Sisi is believed to have orchestrated the coup as well as the ensuing crackdown on the Brotherhood. Estimates provided by human rights campaigners show that 1,400 people have been killed and 22,000 have been arrested in relation to the crackdown on the members and supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood.

"Military An MQ9 Reaper remotely piloted aircraft flies by during a training mission November 17, 2015 at Creech Air Force Base in Indian Springs, Nevada. Photo by AFP The US military forces have secretly been using an airbase in Tunisia for drone operations to gather intelligence from inside oilrich Libya, officials say. The announcement was made by unnamed sources cited in a Washington Post report on Wednesday. Libya has been struggling to contain the Daesh Takfiri terrorists, who started expanding their presence in the country following the overthrow and death of longtime dictator, Muammar Gaddafi, in 2011. The base has apparently been in use since late June in an alleged effort to support the Libyan governments fight against the terrorists currently in control of the northern city of Sirte. The US has also been using bases in Niger and Djibouti but those ones are farther away. Efforts by the administration of President Barack Obama to Access the airbase were meant to keep drones and small Special Operations teams within striking distance of the militants and close a blind spot for US and Western spy agencies. The officials also asserted that the drones were unarmed and tasked with gathering intelligences, adding, they could be armed in the future if Tunis agrees. The Tunisian government is yet to issue a possible response to the report. Drones tasked with assassination in the North African country usually fly out of Naval Air Station Sigonella on the Italian island of Sicily. The reason for keeping use of the airbase secret has been mentioned as part of the Obama administration efforts not to harm Tunisias young democracy, as put by the Washington Post . Washington conducts targeted killings through remotelycontrolled armed drones in several African and Middle Eastern countries. The United States claims the airstrikes target members of alQaeda and other militants, but according to local officials and witnesses, civilians have been the victims of the attacks. The airstrikes, initiated by former US President George W. Bush, have been escalated since Barack Obama took office in 2009.

The premier, who has publicly made the case for a hard Brexit following a June referendum, speaks of the benefits of being an EU member in the hourlong session, whose audio file was leaked to the Guardian on Tuesday night, drawing harsh criticism on Wednesday. I think the economic arguments are clear. I think being part of a 500 million population trading bloc is significant for us. I think, as I was saying to you a little earlier, that one of the issues is that a lot of people will invest here in the UK because it is the UK in Europe, she is heard saying. If we were not in Europe, I think there would be firms and companies who would be looking to say, do they need to develop a mainland Europe presence rather than a UK presence So I think there are definite benefits for us in economic terms. The leader of the rival Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, attacked the prime minister for having failed to address her own concerns about leaving the European Union.

It shouldnt take a leaked tape for the public to find out what she really thinks. The former Labour leader and leading member of the Open Britain campaign group, Ed Miliband, also reacted to the comments, saying, the leaked comments prove that May shares the concerns of all the Britons on Brexit. If private warnings are to be matched by proper public debate, it is essential that the government is not allowed to hoard vital analysis of the impact on our economy of leaving the single market. This work is being done in government and it must now be published, he said, asserting that Mays comments demonstrated that the prime minister was just as worried privately as the rest of us are publicly about the economic impact of the hard, destructive Brexit her government seems set on. According to the Guardian , the audio file was leaked as May was prioritizing cutting immigration over staying in the single market, while refusing to elaborate any further on her plans for taking the UK out of the EU.

"Irans carpet exports to US at 50mn Thu Oct 27, 2016 555AM Economy Iran says it exported about 50 million of handwoven carpets to the United States since the removal of sanctions in January. Iran says its exports of handwoven carpets to the United States have reached around 50 million since the removal of sanctions in January. Hamid Kargar, head of the Iran National Carpet Center, told Reuters that Iran was under pressure in the US market by rivals such as like India, Pakistan and Turkey during the years that the sanctions were in place. Kargar emphasized that the worlds largest buyer imported more than 80 million worth from Iran in 2010, before the trade embargo on the country was tightened. He emphasized that a growth in exports of handwoven carpets will have a positive impact on the lives of the carpet weavers in the country. There are almost 1 million carpet weavers in Iran, 700,000 of whom are working fulltime, Kargar said.

That was a 17.7 percent increase in value and 10 percent rise in weight compared to a year earlier.

Concrete proof that NATO can and will deploy thousands of forces to support our allies. And a clear demonstration of our transatlantic bond.

"Foreign Policy Scotlands Secretary of State David Mundell Photo by AFP Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell has warned about the consequences of the UKs withdrawal from the European Union EU, saying Brexit would cut access to the single market. Mundell told members of the Scottish Parliament on Thursday that neither Scotland nor any other part of the UK was going to get a special deal during the negotiations with the EU. So there are very specific issues to specific industries, but there wont be special deals and its absolutely wrong to characterize a suggestion that certain areas of the country will get a special deal and Scotland will not, he said. I accept on one level, if we are leaving the EU then essentially we are leaving the single market but access to the single market can, I think, continue in a way that doesnt involve tariffs or barriers, the secretary continued. British and Scottish officials have long been engaged in a war of words over the Brexit process, with Scotland asking for an equal role in the negotiations. During an EU referendum on June 23, Scotland voted 62 percent to 38 percent to remain in the 28member bloc, but Britons voted to leave, 52 percent to 48 percent. British Prime Minister Theresa May has made it clear that she will complete the Brexit process by 2019 and that Scotland holds no veto over it. Scotland, in response, has threatened to secede from the UK in order to preserve its EU membership, which in turn guarantees the nations access to the EU single market. Last year, Scotlands first attempt for independence from the UK was blocked by voters in a referendum. Mundell told MSPs that the possibility of a second referendum was already harming Scottish businesses, even more than Brexit. It is already evident, because I understand that the surveyors organization have said there is a drop off in the take up of commercial property in Scotland, he said. Experts warn that in case of a hard Brexit, the UK may lose its preferential access to the EUs single market and suffer from soured relations with other EU members. Loading ... ",state

Last week, Daesh militants set the factory on fire in a bid to prevent army and security units from making advances. There are reports that about 50,000 Iraqi ground troops are involved in the Mosul offensive, including 30,000 army troops, 10,000 Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and the remaining 10,000 from police and Popular Mobilization Units. International aid agencies have warned that the military operation to retake Mosul has displaced about 10,600 people from their homes. Assessments have recorded a significant number of femaleheaded households, raising concerns around the detention or capture of men and boys, said Lise Grande, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Iraq, on Tuesday. She noted that a huge exodus of people from Mosul could occur within the next few days, warning that Daesh terrorists could resort to rudimentary chemical weapons as part of efforts to hold up government forces.

Photo by AFP Former US Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders has denounced Republican nominee Donald Trump as a political coward over a voter suppression report. Sanders condemned Trump after a report that the Republicans presidential campaign has three voter suppression drives intended to lower turnout for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, and to help Trump winning the White House. Anybody who is suppressing the vote because they know that those people will vote against them is a political coward, the Vermont senator tweeted. If you dont have the guts to run for office on your ideas @ realDonaldTrump , then you shouldnt run for office at all, he said in another tweet. A senior adviser to Trump acknowledged in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek that the Republican team has three major voter suppression operations underway. Sanders  a former primary rival of Clinton  suspended his campaign in July and endorsed the former secretary of state, despite leaked emails that showed top officials at the Democratic National Committee DNC privately planned to undermine Sanderss presidential campaign. Sanders had earlier said that he would not endorse Clinton for president until they meet and he could measure her commitment to combating wealth inequality, and other issues that powered his presidential campaign.

"Interviews US First Lady Michelle Obama L listens as Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speaks during a campaign rally in WinstonSalem, North Carolina, on October 27, 2016. Photo by AFP The United States government is trying to distract people from the true nature of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton by accusing Russia of influencing the election against her. Don DeBar, a New Yorkbased author and radio host, made the remarks in an interview with Press TV on Thursday, following Russian President Vladimir Putins response to Washingtons accusations of sponsoring hacking attacks against the US. Speaking to foreign policy experts during a Valdai Discussion Club meeting in Sochi, southern Russia on Thursday, Putin said Washington was using Russia as a distraction to cover the fact that this years White House contenders had nothing to offer on real issues. The subject matter of what is being revealed here is definitely an action item that defines who Clinton is, DeBar said. Also, the thing that is really galling is the fact that we are told to ignore the content, and the content is something that goes to the heart of governing and also to the heart of Clintons record, the analyst noted. This is the person who was married to the guy who signed in three strikes and you are out legislation for people to get life in prison if they are convicted of three felonies, he said. If you look at the things that have been revealed here, some of the acts are themselves the violations of three separate federal criminal sanctions. DeBar argued that Clinton has multiple sets of the triple violations and yet is freely allowed to run for office under federal protection. Clinton and her campaign have repeatedly claimed that Russia was trying to rig the November election in favor of Republican nominee Donald Trump. During the last presidential debate last week, Clinton accused Trump of having secret ties with Moscow, saying that Putin would love to see a puppet in the White House. DeBar dismissed accusations against the Russian president, but noted that since the US was openly seeking regime change in Russia, it is only logical for Russia to fight back. Based on that argument, DeBar said It warrants support and not condemnation even if Russia was trying to fight back in a way or another. Loading ...",state

"Yemen UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash Photo by Reuters The United Arab Emirates, a key Saudi ally in its deadly aggression against Yemen, has welcomed a new United Nations peace proposal to end the Yemen conflict. The UAE supports the efforts of UN Special Envoy for Yemen Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed knowing that the mission of a mediator is always tough, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said on his Twitter account on Thursday. The remarks came two days after the UN envoy submitted the plan to Yemens Houthi Ansarullah movement and its allies. According to informed sources, the roadmap urges agreement on naming a new vice president after the withdrawal of Houthis from the capital Sanaa and other cities and their handover of arms to a third party. The initiative further calls on former Yemeni president, Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, to transfer power to the vice president who would appoint a new premier to form a government. United Nations Special Envoy for Yemen, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, speaks to reporters at Sanaa airport following his visit to the Yemeni capital on October 25, 2016. Photo by Reuters The roadmap represents a political solution for the Yemeni crisis, Gargash said, adding, UN efforts represent a chance to bring Yemenis back to the political track. Other alternatives are gloomy. The Hadi administration, however, said that it had not received any roadmap for a political settlement. Peace talks, which were held between Yemens opposing parties in Kuwait, ended in deadlock in August. Earlier this week, Ahmed made a visit to Sanaa, where he held meetings with Yemens warring sides and called for a return to a cessation of hostilities to allow aid deliveries. The Riyadh regime resumed its deadly airstrikes on Yemen on Sunday hours after a threeday truce in the conflictridden country expired. Yemen has seen almost daily military attacks by Saudi Arabia since late March 2015, with the UN putting the toll from the aggression at more than 10,000. The offensive was launched to crush the Houthi Ansarullah movement and its allies and reinstate the former Yemeni government. The Houthi Ansarullah fighters took state matters in their own hands after the resignation and escape of Hadi, which threw Yemen into a state of uncertainty and threatened a total security breakdown in the country, where an alQaeda affiliate is present.

Images on local news channels showed police in uniform beating activists with batons and leading those detained away to waiting buses. All of a sudden police arrived and started arresting people, media outlets quoted Anila Khawaja, a spokeswoman for PTI as saying. Several PTI leaders and lawmakers have been infuriated by the police raid. The government has proved that there is no democracy in Pakistan, it is a monarchy, Asad Umar, a PTI lawmaker, told reporters from the scene. A spokesman for the Islamabad district administration said the raid was enforcing the order issued earlier in the day by the citys top administrator which outlawed gatherings of more than five people. The Thursday raid came hours after a city order banned all public gatherings ahead of Khans planned protest set to begin on November 2 in Islamabad. Khan, a former Pakistan cricket star who turned politician, has described the upcoming mass protest as a final push to force Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to resign over corruption allegations.

"Society The US is charging dozens of people with participation in a major Indianbased fraud. The US Justice Department has charged 61 people and entities with involvement in a major Indiabased scam that targeted thousands of Americans. The scheme involved Indian call centers, where some workers called American citizens and convinced them to pay their nonexistent debts by impersonating Internal Revenue Service IRS, immigration and other federal officials, the Justice Department said in a statement on Thursday. Some victims were even offered shortterm loans or grants on condition of providing goodfaith deposits or payment of a processing fee. The scammers had stolen more than 300 million from at least 15,000 unsuspecting citizens, the department noted. The victims money was laundered by an American network of criminals who used debit cards or wire transfers under fake identities, the indictment said. Federal officials arrested 20 people across America on Thursday. Additionally, 32 individuals and five call centers in India were charged with connection to the case. US Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell said in a press briefing that Washington was looking forward extraditing the suspects from India to face jail terms. Its really important for the scammers in India to know that the United States is looking at this, is watching them and they could, if they engage in that activity, be extradited to the United Sates and could sit in jail ... for several years, she said. In a bill of indictment for the scammers, the US District Court for the Southern District of Texas had pointed to scare tactics employed by the operators of call centers in Ahmedabad, in the Indian state of Gujarat. They threatened potential victims with arrest, imprisonment, fines or deportation if they did not pay taxes or penalties to the government, it read. The extent of the scam was so vast that major federal organizations such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Treasury, Homeland Security, US Secret Service and police had to help with the investigation, according to the Justice Department.

"Interviews US Democratic presidential nominee former Hillary Clinton boards her campaign plane at Westchester County Airport on October 27, 2016 in White Plains, New York. Photo by AFP One of the most important questions is will US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton rig the election to win the White House like she did in the primaries against Bernie Sanders, asks Myles Hoenig, an American political analyst and activist. Recent polls show that Clintons national lead over Trump is shrinking as the Election Day is approaching. The former secretary of state has the support of 49 percent of likely voters, while the billionaire businessman has 44 percent support, according to the CNN/ORC survey released on Monday. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson has 3 percent support among likely voters, while Green Party nominee Jill Stein has 2 percent support. In every election the race tightens towards the end, Hoenig told Press TV on Thursday. Its really hard to imagine that there is any flux in this election as the supporters of both sides absolutely hate the other. With Obama and Romney, or even Gore and Bush, many of the issues were shared and the voting was often done on personalities or the historical nature of a first black president, regardless of who was pulling whose strings, he said. This election is more polarized than ever. With the Podesta leaks showing Clintons overt racism calling Donna Brazille a buffalo as well as proving that President Obama lied to the public about when he learned of Clintons inappropriate use of her emails, and with the news of Trumps ACCESS Hollywood tape receding into Americas short term memory span, its no wonder the polls are tightening, the analyst stated. The question of the day is will Clinton rig the election like she did the primary, being the only way she could have won, he asked. Were also seeing both Johnsons and Steins numbers dropping but so many are not polled that those numbers are harder to verify, the commentator noted.

We dont  and wont  have a foreign military base in Tunisia, Horchani said, adding, We were one of the few first countries to oppose a foreign military intervention in Libya.

Tunisian soil has never been and never will be used to strike targets in Libya. The drones are used by Tunisians and no one else, Belhassen Oueslati said, adding, As part of TunisianUS bilateral cooperation, we have acquired drones to train our military personnel to use this technology and to control our southeastern border with Libya and detect any suspicious movement. The remarks came after US media claimed that Washington has expanded its deployment of drones to North Africa as part of a secret program. A report by the Washington Post said on Wednesday that unmanned aircraft and US military personnel had been deployed to a facility in Tunisia to conduct spy missions in neighboring Libya. The paper added that drones began flying out of the Tunisian base in late June, claiming that the dispatch of the planes was a key element of the extended US air offensive against a Daesh stronghold in Libya. Daesh, which is known for its terror acts in Iraq and Syria, has been operating mostly in northern Libya, a country which slipped into chaos in 2011 following the ouster of longtime dictator, Muammar Gaddafi.

I strongly believe it is absolutely possible to strengthen European defense without duplicating efforts by NATO, Stoltenberg said on Thursday, adding, EU leaders have also conveyed that this is not about the EU doing collective defense, the EU building structures that would compete with NATO. Stoltenberg made the remarks following a meeting between European Unions foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, and NATO defense ministers in Brussels. Mogherini, one of the strongest supporters of a joint European defense force, has drawn up a global strategy for the bloc, which says the 27nation bloc should seek strategic autonomy to face multiple security threats, ranging from conventional to hybrid warfare, from the Ukraine crisis to Syria, from poverty in Africa to massive refugee flows. The proposal has sparked concerns that the bloc is seeking a more independent role. Mogherini on Thursday said the bloc does have civilian and military operations, such as in Africa or in the Mediterranean, and needs to improve command and control centers to run them. She, however, attempted to downplay concerns that the formation of an EU force could lead to the duplication of NATO functions, saying, But this can be done ... without any kind of overlapping or duplication with NATO.

Last week, the Popular Mobilization Units, a mainlyShia military group backing the Iraqi army in the Mosul offensive, also said its forces would not march into Mosul, adding that Iraqi army soldiers and security personnel would enter the embattled city.

They are armed forces, and we strongly refuse the participation of any nonIraqi fighter in this battle, Hakim said. Last December, Turkey deployed some 150 soldiers, equipped with heavy weapons and backed by 20 to 25 tanks, to the Bashiqa camp. Ankara claimed the deployment was part of a mission to train and equip Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces in the fight against Daesh, but Baghdad denounced the unauthorized move as a violation of Iraqs sovereignty. Recently, Ankara claimed that his country is involved in the Mosul operation, but Baghdad denied such a role. Last week, the Iraqi army, volunteer Shia and Sunni fighters as well as Kurdish Peshmerga forces launched a longawaited operation to wrest control of Mosul, the last stronghold of Daesh in the Arab country. Many believe that the recapture of Mosul, which fell to Daesh in 2014, would signal the terror outfits total defeat in Iraq. Iraqi Special Forces commanders said Thursday that the Mosul operation was proceeding as planned and they were now waiting for further gains in the south before resuming their push toward the city. The operation has not been stopped and is proceeding as planned, Special Forces Brigadier General Haider Fadhil said. In another development on Thursday, the US estimated that up to 900 Daesh terrorists have been killed in the Mosul liberation operation so far. General Joseph Votel, the head the US militarys Central Command, said the operation was taking a heavy toll on the Takfiris. There are between 3,500 and 5,000 Daesh elements in Mosul and up to another 2,000 in the broader area, according to US figures. More Daesh tunnels uncovered Also on Thursday, Iraqi troops discovered several tunnels used by Daesh terrorists in recently recaptured villages of Bartella and Bazwaia, located between 5 and 7 kilometers east of Mosul. When we entered the Khazna Taba neighborhood in Bartella and after we liberated it, we found several tunnels, said Razed Qusai alKinani, a member of Iraqi Counterterrorism forces. One of the tunnels, which is 200 meters long and 10 meters deep, was used by Daesh for meetings and allowed the terror outfits ringleaders to move around during the battle, he added. Elsewhere in the village of Tob Zawa, the Iraqi troops found a tire shop that had been converted into a factory for making roadside bombs and attaching armor to vehicles. They also discovered another tunnel in the village equipped with fans and lights that ran from beneath a mosque out to a road. Loading ...",state

"Politics US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump gestures while speaking to a crowd of donors at the McGlohon Theater in Charlotte, North Carolina, on October 26, 2016. Photo by AFP US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will win the November 8 election, says an American professor who has correctly predicted almost every presidential election in the United States. Professor Helmut Norpoth, of New Yorks SUNY Stony Brook University, said his model shows Trump performed comparatively better in the primaries so he will triumph next month, The Independent reported on Thursday. Norpoth developed a model which, when applied retroactively, successfully predicted every presidential election in the United States since 1912 all but one, which was the 2000 election, when it said Democratic nominee Al Gore would beat Republican candidate George W. Bush. But instead Bush won the election. Al Gore won the popular vote, but Bush was awarded more votes in the Electoral College following a disputed result in Florida. So Bush was declared winner. The political scientists model suggests that the person who emerges as the strongest candidate in the primaries will go on to win the presidency. I think he was the strongest candidate in the primaries and that he will prevail, Professor Norpoth told the New York Post . The model predicted a Trump win in February and nothing has changed since then. Whatever happens in the real world doesnt affect the model, he stated. US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton Professor of Political Science at Stony Brook Helmut Norpoth, New York Recent polls show that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton Clintons national lead over Trump is shrinking as Election Day is approaching. The former secretary of state has the support of 49 percent of likely voters, while the billionaire businessman has 44 percent support, according to the CNN/ORC survey released on Monday. In addition, preliminary figures suggest the US presidential race remains tight in socalled swing states, despite boasting by Clintons campaign that she is far ahead. Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, has an edge in several of the roughly 10 swing states that will decide the 2016 White House race. Trump has also potential advantages of his own in some battleground states. On Wednesday, Trump said that he would win the key battleground states of Ohio, Florida and North Carolina, that could help him claim the election. I think Im gonna win, Trump told ABC News. The billionaire said that he intends to pour in millions of dollars in the final days of the campaign. Loading ...",state

On Thursday, Nadia Murad and Lamia Haji Bashar won the European Parliaments prestigious Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought for their plight when they, along with other women and girls were abducted, tortured and sexually abused by Daesh terrorists after the militants overran northern Iraq two years ago. The two were awarded the prize as part of efforts to protect the Izadis, who are followers of an ancient religion mostly practiced by more than half a million people in northern Iraq. The community members, especially women, have been subject to torture, sexual abuse and slavery by Daesh. European Parliament chief, Martin Schulz, hailed the two Izadi women for their bravery, saying they hada painful and tragic story but felt compelled to survive to bear witness. The courage of these two women, and the dignity they represent defies all description, Schulz told the assembly in Strasbourg. This photo taken on May 5, 2016 shows Lamia Haji Bashar, an 18yearold Izadi girl who escaped Daesh, in northern Iraq. Photo by AP Daesh abducted Murad from her home village of Kocho near Iraqs northern town of Sinjar in August 2014. The slight, softlyspoken young woman, who is now 23, was then brought to the city of Mosul, where she was tortured and raped. Bashar, from the same village, was enslaved and sold two years ago after watching the slaughter of her family and friends by Daesh. The 18yearold then fell prey to an Iraqi hospital director after 20 months of captivity. She later lost her right eye in a mine explosion which hit one of her friends.

Photo by Reuters A court in Bahrain has imprisoned and revoked the citizenship of more than a dozen people after convicting them of terror charges as the ruling Al Khalifah regime continues with its heavyhanded crackdown on political dissidents in the tiny Persian Gulf kingdom. On Thursday, the Fourth High Criminal Court convicted two defendants to 15 years in jail and three others to 10 years behind bars each on charges of forming a terror cell, running it and recruiting new members. Seven other people were slapped with seven years in jail each. Three others, namely Sheikh Mohammad Ali alTal, Mohammad alAali and Ismail Abdulaziz, were sentenced to life imprisonment. The trio were also ordered to pay a cash fine of 200,000 Bahraini dinars over 530,000. The court later revoked the citizenship of all the 15 defendants. Separately, Bahrains Supreme Criminal Court sentenced two civilians to 5 years in prison on charge of holding an antiregime protest in the small village of Jurdab earlier this year, and setting scrap tires ablaze. Thousands of antiregime protesters have held numerous demonstrations in Bahrain on an almost daily basis ever since a popular uprising began in the kingdom on February 14, 2011. They are demanding that the Al Khalifah dynasty relinquish power and a just system representing all Bahrainis be established. Manama has spared no effort to clamp down on the dissent and rights activists.

In May, the internationallybacked progovernment troops started a largescale military operation, including streetbystreet fighting backed by heavy airstrikes and artillery fire, to eradicate Daesh militants in Sirte. They have so far recaptured most areas in the city. Most of Daesh commanders in the city fled to other places and the remaining rank has been holding out via sniper fire, booby traps and car bombs.

"Society US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas A female lawyer has accused US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas of sexually assaulting her in 1999, a report says. Moira Smith, who works as a corporate lawyer with an Alaska energy company, said the judge made unwanted sexual advances on her during a dinner party when she was 23yearold, the National Law Journal reported on Thursday. She said Thomas grabbed and squeezed her buttocks several times during the party in Falls Church, Virginia. Justice Thomas touched me inappropriately and without my consent, Smith said. He groped me while I was setting the table, suggesting I should sit right next to him, Smith said. He was 5 or 6 inches down and he got a good handful and he kept squeezing me and pulling me close to him, she stated, according to the journal. In a statement to the National Law Journal, Thomas, 68, dismissed the allegation as preposterous, saying that the incident never happened. Smith, currently vice president and general counsel at Enstar Natural Gas Co in Alaska, said she decided to speak out after hearing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps lewd comments about women. A 2005 video was released earlier this month by The Washington Post, in which Trump can be heard making lewd comments about women and bragging about groping them. A number of women have since come forward claiming that the business mogul has sexually assaulted them. Trump has called the allegations slander and libel and part of a concerted, coordinated and vicious attack by Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and the news media to undercut his campaign. Moira Smith said Justice Clarence Thomas groped her at her boss dinner party when she was 23. That willingness by men in power to take advantage of vulnerable women relies on an unspoken pact that the women will not speak up about it, Smith, now 41, told the journal. Why Because they are vulnerable. Because they are starstruck. Because they dont want to be whiners. Because they worry about their career if they do speak out. But silence no longer feels defensible it feels complicit, she stated. As the mother of a young daughter and son, I am coming forward to show that it is important to stand up for yourself and tell the truth, Smith said.

"Russia This photo taken from a Norwegian surveillance aircraft shows Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov in international waters off the coast of Northern Norway on October 17, 2016. Via Reuters Russia says it has cancelled plans for a fleet of its warships to refuel at a Spanish port on their way to Syria. Vasily Nioradze, a spokesman at the Russian embassy in Madrid, said on Wednesday that the request was canceled, without giving further details, the Associated Press reported. The Spanish Foreign Ministry also confirmed that Russia had withdrawn its request for the warships to refuel in the Spanish port of Ceuta. The Russian embassy in Madrid has just told us that it is withdrawing its demand for permission to stop over for the boats, which means that the stopovers have been cancelled, the ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. The development came after Spain, a NATO member state, said it was reviewing Russias request to refuel its naval fleet at Ceuta after passing through the Straits of Gibraltar en route to Syria, where Russian forces are engaged in an antiterror campaign in support of the Syrian government. In a statement released on Wednesday, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said that Spain had been allowing Russian navy ships to dock in Spanish ports for years, but that it treated such requests on a case by case basis. The naval group, which passed through the English Channel on Friday, is made up of Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov, as well as a nuclearpowered battle cruiser, two antisubmarine warships and four support vessels, escorted by submarines. The fleet will join around 10 other Russian vessels already off the Syrian coast. Ceuta sits on the tip of Africas north coast, across the Straits of Gibraltar from mainland Spain, and bordering Morocco. The port is part of the EU, but its NATO status is unclear. Since 2011, at least 60 Russian warships have docked in Ceuta. NATO irked by Spains announcement NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg claimed that the Western military alliance was concerned by the deployment of the Russian warships. It is each up to each nation to decide, as has been NATO policy for many years, but we are concerned about the potential use of this carrier group to increase attacks in Aleppo, Stoltenberg said, adding, All allies are aware of our concerns. Britain echoes NATOs stance British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon also said on Wednesday that London would be extremely concerned if Spain refueled the Russian carrier group heading through the Mediterranean towards Syria. NATO should be standing together, he added. Since March 2011, Syria has been hit by militancy it blames on some Western states and their regional allies. Russia has been conducting air raids against Daesh and other terrorist groups in the Middle Eastern country at the Damascus governments request for more than a year now. Russia boosts Baltic Fleet In another development on Wednesday, a report said that Russia was reinforcing its Baltic Fleet in Kaliningrad with two small warships armed with longrange cruise missiles to counter a worrying NATO buildup in the region. The report by Russias daily Izvestia quoted an unidentified military source as saying that the vessels, the Serpukhov and the Zeleny Dol, had already entered the Baltic Sea and would soon become part of a newly formed division.

Photo by Reuters Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says comprehensive international determination is necessary to fight and uproot terrorism in the Middle East. The Iranian foreign minister made the remarks at the end of a threeway meeting among him and his Russian and Syrian counterparts, Sergei Lavrov and Walid alMuallem respectively, in Moscow on Friday on the latest situation in Syria. Zarif said Tehran, Moscow and Damascus should reinforce their cooperation in the campaign against terrorism. He stressed the importance of adopting strategies to stop the delivery of weapons and military equipment to the foreignbacked Takfiri militants wreaking havoc in Syria. The political settlement of the crisis in Syria will be possible through negotiations between the sides in order to put an end to this crisis, Zarif said. The three foreign ministers agreed to intensify the fight against terrorism and said their countries have a common stance on the antiterror campaign in the region, particularly in Syria. Lavrov said Iran, Russia and Syria have determined necessary frameworks for fighting terrorism and expressed their readiness to take measures that will play a key role in the campaign against the malicious phenomenon. The Russian foreign minister added that the Moscow meeting highlighted the significance of a firm and efficient battle against terrorism in the Middle East, particularly in Syria. He said the meetings participants also discussed ways to send humanitarian aid to civilians in Syria and stop the flow of weapons into the hands of terrorists operating in the warhit country. Muallem, for his part, said the US is making no effort to find a political solution to the Syrian crisis. The Syrian foreign minister added that a recent agreement between Washington and Moscow, signed in the Swiss city of Geneva in September, failed to bear any fruit. After marathon talks in Geneva, US Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart reached an agreement on September 10 to impose a ceasefire in the Syrian city of Aleppo and to coordinate military operations against terrorist groups in the country. Aleppo, Syrias second largest city, remains divided between government forces in the west and foreignbacked terrorists in the east, making it a frontline battleground. Russia, which has been conducting an aerial military campaign against extremist militants in Syria, has repeatedly voiced its readiness for a ceasefire. Russia has been insisting, however, that any such lull in fighting should be accompanied with a meticulous separation of terrorists from less extremist militants fighting against the Syrian government. The Syrian foreign minister said Washington is not interested in solving the crisis in Damascus and takes measures only to serve the its own interests and those of its regional allies. Since March 2011, Syria has been hit by militancy it blames on some Western states and their regional allies. Backed by the Russian air cover, the Syrian military is engaged in an operation to rid the country of Daesh and other terrorist groups. The socalled Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and United Nations Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura have put the death toll from the Syria conflict at more than 300,000 and 400,000, respectively. This is while the UN has stopped its official casualty count in Syria, citing its inability to verify the figures it receives from various sources. Over the past few weeks, the Syrian forces have wrested control of several areas across the wartorn country as they press ahead with their counterterrorism operations. Iran, Russia share strong antiterror stance Zarif Meanwhile, in a meeting with his Russian counterpart earlier on Friday, the Iranian foreign minister said Tehran and Moscow have tough stances in the fight against terrorism in the region through common strategies. Tehran and Moscow have broad cooperation on regional issues such as the campaign against terrorism and extremism and we share views on these matters, Zarif added. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov R speaks with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif during a meeting in Moscow, Russia, on October 28, 2016.

I am pleased that in recent years relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Russian Federation, as two good neighbors and two key players, have made many positive developments, Zarif said. Lavrov, for his part, said Tehran and Moscow urged cooperation on an unrelenting approach to terrorists operating against the Syrian government. Iran and Russia have similar stances on the ongoing deadly crisis in Syria. Moscow and Tehran reject any foreign interference in the affairs of the warhit country, stressing that only the Syrians are entitled to decide their own fate.

The people that rallying around our team, rallying around our cause, love this country, are passionate about this country and are anxious to see change, the GOP vice presidential nominee stated. He went on to accuse the media of unfairly backing Clinton.

The seafarers arrived at the airport in the Philippine capital Manila on Friday. I am so happy. This is what I had been praying for every night, said Arnel Balbero, 33, as he was embraced by his four siblings at the airport. Just to be with my family, even if we have nothing, even if we have only little to eat, I am already happy, he said. His sister, Lilia, trembled at the sight of her brother. Its like a miracle. We never lost hope he would be freed, she said. The Filipinos were among 26 freed hostages from Cambodia, China, Taiwan, Indonesia and Vietnam who were freed on October 22. The 26 hostages plus three others made up the crew of Naham 3, which was seized south of the Seychelles in March 2012. The captain of their Omaniflagged but Taiwaneseowned vessel died during the hijacking and two other crew members succumbed to illness in captivity. Recounting memories Balberos cousin and fellow exhostage, Elmer, said the Somali pirates had cared little about the health of their captives. We asked the pirates for medicine but they did not give us any. Instead they said, Where is your money said Elmer. The captives also said they suffered beatings at the hands of the pirates. In our first week, they called it our introduction. They used bamboo to beat us, Arnel said. To survive, the Filipinos did chores for their captors, washing their clothes and even their weapons. We took it as a chance to also wash. We couldnt take a bath often because they only gave us a liter of water each day, Arnel said. Hugging his two teenage daughters, Elmer said it was thoughts of seeing his family again that kept him going during his captivity. Taiwans Foreign Ministry said the men were freed after a ransom was paid by the ships owner as well as groups contracted to negotiate with the pirates, Taiwanese media reported. John Steed, who works with the Hostage Support Partnership, said the local community and tribal elders were involved in the difficult situation. These are poor fishermen. The ship had no value, they had no insurance, and of course governments dont want to be involved in these sort of negotiations either, he said.

Photo by AFP A new report has revealed that the number of Palestinian homes demolished by Israeli authorities in the largest division of the occupied West Bank since the beginning of the current year stands at more than 700. Israels Hebrewlanguage Haaretz newspaper reported on Friday that a total of 780 Palestinian homes have been demolished in Area C of the West Bank, which constitutes about 61 percent of the territory and is under full Israeli military control, since January, leaving 1,129 people homeless.

The demolitions affected 164 Palestinians in the region, marking an increase from 108 the previous year. The revelations came only two days after Israeli military forces razed three Palestinian homes in the Beit Hanina and Silwan neighborhoods of East Jerusalem alQuds, displacing at least 44 people, including minors. International bodies and rights groups argue that Israels sustained demolitions of Palestinian homes and structures in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem alQuds are an attempt by the Tel Aviv regime to uproot Palestinians from their native territories, and confiscate more land for expansion of illegal settlements. More than half a million Israelis live in over 230 illegal settlements built since the 1967 Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and East Jerusalem alQuds. The presence and continued expansion of Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian lands have created a major obstacle for the efforts to establish peace in the Middle East. The Palestinian Authority wants the West Bank as part of a future independent Palestinians state, with East Jerusalem alQuds as its capital. Loading ...",state
"Iran raps rare EU clauses in trade deals Fri Oct 28, 2016 137PM Economy Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, Irans deputy minister of roads and urban development, has criticized very exceptional terms and conditions that Europeans are including in trade deals with Iran. A top official in Tehran has accused European government of failing to take the required measures to facilitate trade agreements with Iran  what he says is already in violation of a nuclear agreement that was sealed with the country last summer and came into effect in January. Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, Irans deputy minister of roads and urban development, told the Financial Times that European government should prevent the inclusion of what he described as very exceptional terms and conditions in trade agreements with Iran. Fakhrieh Kashan warned that such terms and conditions were effectively discouraging investments in the Iranian economy. He said export credit agencies were specifically demanding premiums on insurance that made banks insist on putting what he described as unacceptable terms in contracts related to political risk in doing business with Iran. Fakhrieh Kashan emphasized that Iran will not accept any clauses in trade agreements which he said foresee such possibilities like snapback sanctions and new sanctions against Iran. European businesses, he said, are in fact trying to devise deals in which political risks are inserted alongside commercial risks  what he said is totally rejected by the Islamic Republic. If anyone needed guarantees against political risks, it was Iran, Fakhrieh Kashan said in reference to the impact of western sanctions on the Iranian economy. Why should Iran accept very exceptional terms and conditions in its contracts with European companies This is not called a normal relationship, he said. Fakhrieh Kashan emphasized that European countries should take the adequate measures to prevent their businesses from including political risk in contracts, warning that any failure to do so will be against the nuclear agreement with Iran. This is where European countries are failing to be committed to the nuclear agreement. One of the main reasons the signing of contracts in various sectors has been delayed is this issue. Last summer, Iran signed a historic deal with the US, Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany  the socalled P51 group  based on which it agreed to restrict certain aspects of its nuclear energy activities. The P51 in return agreed to lift certain economic sanctions imposed against the Islamic Republic. Loading ...",state

Straight up corruption at its finest 100percentfedUp.com  Talk about covering your ass Loretta Lynch did just that when she plead the Fifth to avoid incriminating herself over payments to IranCorrupt to the core Attorney General Loretta Lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of Congress about the Obama administrations secret efforts to send Iran 1.7 billion in cash earlier this year, prompting accusations that Lynch has pleaded the Fifth Amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments, according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. Sen. Marco Rubio R., Fla. and Rep. Mike Pompeo R., Kan. initially presented Lynch in October with a series of questions about how the cash payment to Iran was approved and delivered. In an Oct. 24 response, Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik responded on Lynchs behalf, refusing to answer the questions and informing the lawmakers that they are barred from publicly disclosing any details about the cash payment, which was bound up in a ransom deal aimed at freeing several American hostages from Iran. The response from the attorney generals office is unacceptable and provides evidence that Lynch has chosen to essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries regarding herrole in providing cash to the worlds foremost state sponsor of terrorism, Rubio and Pompeo wrote on Friday in a followup letter to Lynch.

"Red State  Fox News Sunday reported this morning that Anthony Weiner is cooperating with the FBI, which has reopened yes, lefties reopened the investigation into Hillary Clintons classified emails. Watch as Chris Wallace reports the breaking news during the panel segment near the end of the show And the news is breaking while were on the air. Our colleague Bret Baier has just sent us an email saying he has two sources who say that Anthony Weiner, who also had coownership of that laptop with his estranged wife Huma Abedin, is cooperating with the FBI investigation, had given them the laptop, so therefore they didnt need a warrant to get in to see the contents of said laptop. Pretty interesting development. Targets of federal investigations will often cooperate, hoping that they will get consideration from a judge at sentencing. Given Weiners wellknown penchant for lying, its hard to believe that a prosecutor would give Weiner a deal based on an agreement to testify, unless his testimony were very strongly corroborated by hard evidence. But cooperation can take many forms  and, as Wallace indicated on this mornings show, one of those forms could be signing a consent form to allow   the contents of devices that they could probably get a warrant for anyway. Well see if Weiners cooperation extends beyond that. More Related",bias

"Email HEALTHCARE REFORM TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN Since March of 2010, the American people have had to suffer under the incredible economic burden of the Affordable Care ActObamacare. This legislation, passed by totally partisan votes in the House and Senate and signed into law by the most divisive and partisan President in American history, has tragically but predictably resulted in runaway costs, websites that dont work, greater rationing of care, higher premiums, less competition and fewer choices. Obamacare has raised the economic uncertainty of every single person residing in this country. As it appears Obamacare is certain to collapse of its own weight, the damage done by the Democrats and President Obama, and abetted by the Supreme Court, will be difficult to repair unless the next President and a Republican congress lead the effort to bring muchneeded free market reforms to the healthcare industry. Congress must act. Our elected representatives in the House and Senate must 1. Completely repeal Obamacare. Our elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to. 2. Modify existing law that inhibits the sale of health insurance across state lines. As long as the plan purchased complies with state requirements, any vendor ought to be able to offer insurance in any state. By allowing full competition in this market, insurance costs will go down and consumer satisfaction will go up. 3. Allow individuals to fully deduct health insurance premium payments from their tax returns under the current tax system. Businesses are allowed to take these deductions so why wouldnt Congress allow individuals the same exemptions As we allow the free market to provide insurance coverage opportunities to companies and individuals, we must also make sure that no one slips through the cracks simply because they cannot afford insurance. We must review basic options for Medicaid and work with states to ensure that those who want healthcare coverage can have it. TRENDING ON 100 Fed Up ",bias

"BREAKING NYPD Ready To Make Arrests In Weiner CaseHillary Visited Pedophile Island At Least 6 TimesMoney Laundering, Underage Sex, PayforPlay,Proof of Inappropriate Handling Classified Information Blackwater USA Founder, Retired Navy Seal Erik Prince Prince claimed he had insider knowledge of the investigation that could help explain why FBI Director James Comey had to announce he was reopening the investigation into Clintons email server last week. Because of Weinergate and the sexting scandal, the NYPD started investigating it. Through a subpoena, through a warrant, they searched his laptop, and sure enough, found those 650,000 emails. They found way more stuff than just more information pertaining to the inappropriate sexting the guy was doing, Prince claimed. They found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times, he said. The amount of garbage that they found in these emails, of criminal activity by Hillary, by her immediate circle, and even by other Democratic members of Congress was so disgusting they gave it to the FBI, and they said, Were going to go public with this if you dont reopen the investigation and you dont do the right thing with timely indictments, Prince explained. I believe  I know, and this is from a very wellplaced source of mine at 1PP, One Police Plaza in New York  the NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in this investigation, and theyve gotten huge pushback, to the point of coercion, from the Justice Department, with the Justice Department threatening to charge someone that had been unrelated in the accidental heart attack death of Eric Garner almost two years ago. Thats the level of pushback the Obama Justice Department is doing against actually seeking justice in the email and other related criminal matters, Prince said. Theres five different parts of the FBI conducting investigations into these things, with constant downdrafts from the Obama Justice Department. So in the, I hope, unlikely and very unfortunate event that Hillary Clinton is elected president, we will have a constitutional crisis that we have not seen since, I believe, 1860, Prince declared. Marlow asked Prince to clarify these revelations. NYPD was the first one to look at that laptop, Prince elaborated. Weiner and Huma Abedin, his wife  the closest adviser of Hillary Clinton for 20 years  have both flipped. They are cooperating with the government. They both have  they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes, for Huma Abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the State Department server and from Hillary Clintons own homebrew server, which contained classified information. Weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found. So NYPD first gets that computer. They see how disgusting it is. They keep a copy of everything, and they pass a copy on to the FBI, which finally pushes the FBI off their chairs, making Comey reopen that investigation, which was indicated in the letter last week. The point being, NYPD has all the information, and they will pursue justice within their rights if the FBI doesnt, Prince contended. There is all kinds of criminal culpability through all the emails theyve seen of that 650,000, including money laundering, underage sex, payforplay, and, of course, plenty of proof of inappropriate handling, sending/receiving of classified information, up to SAP level Special Access Programs, he stated. So the plot thickens. NYPD was pushing because, as an article quoted one of the chiefs  thats the level just below commissioner  he said as a parent, as a father with daughters, he could not let that level of evil continue, Prince said. He noted that the FBI can investigate these matters, but they cant convene a grand jury. They cant file charges. The prosecutors, the Justice Department has to do that, he explained. Now, as I understand it, Preet Bharara, the Manhattan prosecutor, has gotten ahold of some of this. From what I hear, hes a standup guy, and hopefully he does the right thing. Marlow agreed that Bhararas sterling reputation as a determined prosecutor was bad news for the Clintons. Prince agreed, but said, If people are willing to bend or break the law and dont really care about the Constitution or due process  if youre willing to use Stalinist tactics against someone  who knows what level of pressure could be brought to bear against even the most tenacious law enforcement officials Listen to interview here The point being, fortunately, its not just the FBI there are five different offices that are in the hunt for justice, but the NYPD has it as well, Prince said, citing the Wall Street Journal reporting that has exposed downdraft, back pressure from the Justice Department against both the FBI and NYPD, in an effort to keep the sunlight and the disinfecting effects of the truth and transparency from shining on this great evil that has gone on, and is slowly being exposed. The Justice Department is trying to run out the clock, to elect Hillary Clinton, to prevent any real justice from being done, he warned. As for the mayor of New York City, Prince said he has heard that de Blasio wants to stay away from this. The evidence is so bad, the email content is so bad, that I think even he wants to stay away from it, which is really telling, he said. For entire story Breitbart News 14.7K shares ",bias

"Email For Republican politicians like Ohio Governor John Kasich who refused to get behind Donald J. Trumpit turns out Trump was righthe didnt need you. In spite of the massive media force who came out against him, and the never Trumpers from his own party who worked very hard to defeat him, if Obama was running against Donald J. Trump today, Trump would have beaten him Its easy to glance at Tuesdays popular vote  which, with 92 percent of all precincts reporting, shows Hillary Clinton with six million fewer votes than Barack Obama won in 2012  and reach the conclusion that Clinton lost the White House because she failed to turn out the Democratic base. But the truth is much more complicated. While she underperformed relative to Obamas 2012 totals in several Midwestern states  Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, and Wisconsin  Clinton ran virtually even with Obama in the battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada, and New Hampshire. Whats more, she far surpassed Obamas 2012 vote total in Florida, the countrys biggest swing state. Yet somehow, while Obama carried Florida, Clinton lost it. Which brings us to an important question Was Donald Trump just good enough to beat a bad Democratic opponent on Tuesday, or does he deserve far more credit Could he, for instance, have competed with the vaunted Obama machine The answer, somewhat shockingly, is yes. A review of vote totals in the past two elections reveals that Trump 2016 would have defeated Obama 2012 in the electoral college. Disclaimer This obviously is an applestooranges exercise because no two elections are the same, nor are any two electorates. Still, unlike debating whether the 2016 Cubs would defeat the 1927 Yankees, this is not an entirely abstract argument a comparison of their respective performances in the countrys most competitive states shows Trump edging Obama in a hypothetical headtohead matchup. The math might seem impossible. After all, Obama won nearly 66 million votes in 2012 Trump is currently at 59.5 million and should finish around 60 million, which will actually be one million fewer votes than Mitt Romney won. How, then, could Trump have topped Obama in the electoral college The answer Republican turnout lagged in certain parts of the country but shot through the roof in the nations most critical battleground states. Lets look at them individually, in descending order by population, and do the electoralvote math. The 2016 totals arent yet final because not all precincts have reported.

"Go to Article Donald Trump was willing to give up a very fulfilling life that took decades to build, so he could step up and take control of an out of control government. He and his family have already sacrificed so much because he chose to put his country first. Making sacrifices is certainly not something loudmouth liberals like Robert DeNiro are accustomed to. DeNiro was very vocal about his opposition to the wildly successful business man Donald J. Trump. He felt so strongly about his hate for Trump that made a video where he angrily stated hed like to, punch him in the face. Now that Trump won the election in a landslide, DeNiro has chosen to get behind the Trump rioters who are terrorizing cities across America. AntiTrump rioters are breaking windows, using baseball bats to smash the windshields of innocent citizens who get trapped in their hellish protests as they try to escape. Women who are taking part in the protests are being punched in the faces by men who are also taking part in the George Soros funded protests. American flags are being burned and families who are walking in major cities are being subjected to the most vile and disgusting, hateful language and images imaginable. If this is the kind of America that Robert DiNero is openly supporting And if so, why would any American pay to see his movie,Comedian Robert De Niro gave antiDonald Trump protesters across the United States his backing Friday as he spoke about how depressed the tycoons win in the presidential election had made him. The 73yearold star was on the red carpet at the world premiere of his new film The Comedian in Los Angeles when he was asked how he was coping with Trumps victory over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. How am I doing Im very depressed, the famously laconic Raging Bull actor told reporters. We have to just wait and see how things go and keep our eyes ever vigilant on the new government. Asked if he thought the protests were an appropriate response to the outcome of Tuesdays election, he replied Yes, absolutely. Things arent being done right. Demonstrators took to the streets in Miami, Los Angeles, New York and other US cities for a third straight night on Friday. In Manhattan, they held signs reading Your Wall Cant Stand in Our Way  a reference to the antiimmigration barrier the billionaire has promised to build on the US border with Mexico. De Niro hasnt minced his words in his criticism of Trump, describing him as a punk, a pig and an idiot. Id like to punch him in the face, he said before the election. Earlier in the day a town in southern Italy where De Niros grandparents came from offered the actor a means of escape. If, after the disappointment of Trump, he wants to take refuge here, we are ready to welcome him, said Antonio Cerio, the mayor of Ferrazzano. The Comedian, De Niros passion project which took him eight years to bring to the big screen, was part of this years program for the American Film Institutes annual AFI Fest in Los Angeles.

Some of the past Presidents try to console him while looking in the direction of the modern Presidents as if to say, What have you done Many of these modern Presidents, seemingly oblivious to anything other than themselves, appear to be congratulating each other on their great accomplishments. In front of the man, paper trash is blowing in the wind. Crumpled dollar bills, legislative documents, and, like a whisperthe U.S. Constitution beneath the foot of Barack Obama. THE FORGOTTEN MAN McNaughton never sells his original paintings BUT he made an exception this time. He sold this painting to Sean Hannity so Hannity could give it to Donald Trump.

"Go to Article Dear Abby, I supported a woman I knew had a history of criminal activity, who is married to a rapist and who left 4 men to die in Benghazi. She put our national security at grave risk by leaving top classified emails on her private server, and she took money from nations who throw gays off rooftops and treat women worse than cockroaches. She is likely very sick and would be unlikely to serve out her first term without someone there to prop her up, but nevertheless, I supported her anyhow, because shes a Democrat and has a vagina. Someone told me she still has a chance of winning the presidency if I just signed a petition. They said that Trump really didnt win, because Hillary won the popular vote. Is that true Okay, lets address this Hillary might win the popular vote, isnt that Electoral College situation just awful thing head on. No, its not awful. Its great, and it protects the importance of your vote. Its also uniquely American and demonstrates yet again the onceincreation brilliance of the Founding Fathers. First of all, shes probably not going to win the actual number of votes cast. She may win the number of votes counted, but not the votes cast. States dont count their absentee ballots unless the number of outstanding absentee ballots is larger than the state margin of difference. If there is a margin of 1,000 votes counted and there are 1,300 absentee ballots outstanding, then the state tabulates those. If the number of outstanding absentee ballots wouldnt influence the election results, then the absentee ballots arent counted. Who votes by absentee ballot Students overseas, the military, businesspeople on trips, etc. The historical breakout for absentee ballots is about 6733 Republican. In 2000, when Al Gore won the popular vote nationally by 500,000 votes and the liberal media screamed bloody murder, there were 2 million absentee ballots in California alone. A 6733 breakout of those yields a 1.33 to 0.667million Republican vote advantage, so Bush would have gotten a 667,000vote margin from Californias uncounted absentee ballots alone So much for Gores 500,000 popular vote victory. That was the headline on the N.Y. Times, and it was the lead story on NBC Nightly News, right No Youre kidding. Getting back to the win the popular vote/lose the Electoral College scenario Thank Gd we have that, or else California and N.Y. would determine every election. Every time. But the Electoral College brilliantly smooths out the variances in the voting proclivities among states and regions. Farmers in the middle of the country and importers and exporters on the shore get roughly equal say, as do Madison Ave. execs and factory workers in Tennessee. Shortcomings Sure. The E.C. can make an R vote meaningless in a very few heavily D states or vice versa. But without the Electoral College, the countrys entire population is subject to the disproportionate voting preferences of the few most populous states.

"Go to Article Political activist and Hillary supporter Amal Clooney traveled to Texas to warn Americans about our elected President Donald J. Trump and his tough immigration policies. Maybe she didnt get the memoTrumps tough immigration stance is what catapulted him to the top of the heap in the crowded pack of GOP primary contenders. It wasnt too long ago that her arrogant liberal husband announced with great confidence, There will never be a President Trump. Perhaps Amal shouldve traveled to some of the border towns if she wanted to get a clear picture of how illegal immigration is affecting our nation. Aliens crossing our borders illegally have destroyed the property of American ranchers, and threatened the safety and security of American citizens living in homes in or near the US Mexican border towns Amal Clooney has warned that many of presidentelect Trumps proposals would be violations of international law. Speaking at the Texas Conference For Women at the Austin Convention Center on Tuesday, the international human rights lawyer, and wife of George Clooney, said she had concerns about Americas reputation under the real estate moguls plans. She noted that Trumps comments during his campaign, that there should be a religious test imposed on entering the U.S. or the fact that there should be statesponsored torture or that families of suspected terrorists should all be killed  all of those things are violations of international human rights law and the values that underlie that. The 38yearold wife said Americas reputation as a country with a strong human rights record and high moral standing was at risk. I think theres some concern from abroad as to, Are these things actually going to happen, or is the U.S. going to lose some of the moral standing that it has internationally, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Perhaps its time to put our nations security and sovereignty before we worry about what people in other countries around the world think of us Both Amal and her Hollywood actor husband George, a staunch Hillary Clinton supporter, have spoken out against Trump in the past. Earlier this year, Amal Clooney called for Trump to be challenged on his extreme views. Watch George Clooney here whine about press giving Trump too much favorable press When you listen to what the leading candidate on the Republican side has been saying about building walls, about excluding Mexicans and a complete shutdown of all Muslims entering in, and if you actually look at what he specifically said in that now infamous speech about Muslims, he kept saying, They only want jihad.

"Go to Article They had to know they had it coming Donald Trump scolded media big shots during an offtherecord Trump Tower sitdown on Monday, sources told The Post. It was like a fing firing squad, one source said of the encounter. Trump started with CNN chief Jeff Zucker and said I hate your network, everyone at CNN is a liar and you should be ashamed,  the source said. The meeting was a total disaster. The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration, but instead they got a Trumpstyle dressing down, the source added. A second source confirmed the fireworks. The meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks, the other source said. Trump kept saying, Were in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong. He addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. He called out Jeff Zucker by name and said everyone at CNN was a liar, and CNN was a network of liars, the source said. Trump didnt say NBC reporter Katy Tur by name, but talked about an NBC female correspondent who got it wrong, then he referred to a horrible network correspondent who cried when Hillary lost who hosted a debate  which was Martha Raddatz who was also in the room. The stunned reporters tried to get a word in edgewise to discuss access to a Trump Administration. CBS Good Morning cohost Gayle King did not stand up, but asked some question, How do you propose we the media work with you Chuck Todd asked some pretty pointed questions. David Muir asked How are you going to cope living in DC while your family is in NYC It was a horrible meeting. Heres a sampling of Trump hitting back at the dishonest media while he was on the campaign trail. Trump did something no other presidential candidate has ever done before, he won the election in a landslide, in spite of the entire fake news empire working together to take him down Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway told reporters the gathering went well. Excellent meetings with the top executives of the major networks, she said during a gaggle in the lobby of Trump Tower. Pretty unprecedented meeting we put together in two days. The meeting was off the record, meaning the participants agreed not to talk about the substance of the conversations. The hourlong session included top execs from network and cable news channels.

"on October 27, 2016 253 am  Conservatives claim that voter ID is necessary to catch illegal voters, but it turns out theyre the only ones creating fake IDs to use on Election Day. Trump supporters are taking Trumps call to monitor polling places so seriously that they are creating fake ID badges in order to infiltrate polling locations across the country and intimidate voters by interrogating them, confusing them, and filming them  all of which are illegal. But, Trumps deplorables are doing this in droves with the help of a rightwing group known as Vote Protectors. The group, which is affiliated with top Trump ally Roger Stone, is giving people the ability to intimidate voters on Election Day. They are literally teaching them to create their own fake badge, which is designed to give them access to voters both inside and outside the polling places where citizens cast their votes. According to the Huffington Post , Stones group created an officiallooking ID badge for its volunteers to wear, and its volunteers planned to videotape voters and conduct fake exit polls, efforts that election experts say risks intimidating and confusing voters. Or at least thats what the group was planning to do before The Huffington Post asked Stone about it on Tuesday. The controversial Trump ally, long known for his bareknuckled political tactics, said that key proposals on his groups websites were there without his knowledge, and assured HuffPost that he would operate within the confines of election law. In fact, after HuffPo confronted Stone with evidence that these kinds of tactics were being pursued by the website, he acknowledged that Vote Protectors had a bad idea and ordered them taken down. Campaign Legal Center deputy director Danielle Lang called the tactics a clear voter intimidation scheme. Its inherently intimidating and an invasion of privacy, she told HuffPo in reference to the videotaping. When thats being live streamed to the internet, it amplifies the potentially intimidating aspect of it, and violates a sense of security and privacy people have a right to enjoy at the polls. Objectively, intimidating voters is unlawful, no matter where you do it. Indeed, but thats exactly what Donald Trump has been calling upon his supporters to do because he has repeatedly claimed that the election is rigged against him. As it turns out, hes right about the election being rigged, only its conservatives who are trying to rig it in favor of Trump. Earlier this week, a Wisconsin city clerk in Green Bay got caught trying to intentionally prevent college students from voting by arguing in an email to the Wisconsin Ethics Commission that an extra polling place should not be opened near the University of WisconsinGreen Bay because she has merely heard that students lean Democrat. I was reading the statutes and read No site may be designated that affords an advantage to any political party, Republican appointed clerk Kris Teske wrote. UWGB is a polling location for students and residents on Election Day but I feel by asking for this to be the site for early voting is encouraging the students to vote more than benefiting the city as a whole. I have heard it said that students lean more toward the democrats and he is a democrat. I have spoken with our Chief of Staff and others at City Hall and they agree that budget wise this isnt going to happen. I would like to know your thoughts on this. Do I have an argument about it being more of a benefit to the democrats. So not only are Trump supporters trying to rig the election with voter intimidation tactics using hypocritical methods, they are using voter suppression tactics as well. And that is likely going to cause a lot of Election Day chaos. Voters should be prepared to stand up for their right to vote no matter what Trumps deplorables try to do to keep them from exercising it.

"on October 30, 2016 224 pm  One thing that has continuously dogged the Donald Trump for president campaign is the fact that racists, antisemites, xenophobes, misogynists, and various other bigots have stuck with the bombastic real estate mogul since he first launched his travesty of a campaign. No matter how much Trumps people try to say he doesnt want the support of such folks, the candidate himself refuses to take the fact that there is anything about the campaign he has been running that attracts these people seriously. So, naturally, when Trumps campaign manager Kellyanne Conway sat down with an interview with CNNs Jake Tapper on Sunday , that particular issue came up again. Of course, Conway was not happy. Tapper began There are a lot of antiSemites and racists and misogynists who support the Trump candidacy. Conway immediately went on defense, saying, wow. Tapper went on to reference a man who was shouting JEWSA at the press pen at a recent Trump rally, and directly asked Conway if she would refer to such people as deplorable. She responded Yes, I would. Wow, I have to push back on some of the adjectives you just used to describe  I hope youve been to Trump rallies and I hope that youve seen the tens of thousands. I mean, hes had over half a million people easily, I think in excess of that. These are U.S.A.loving Americans. Tapper went on to say that no, he isnt putting all Trump supporters into that camp, but went on to force Conways hand on this one But without question, people who are experts on hate groups say that there has been a comfort level that has been offered to people who are antiSemitic that has been offered to people who are antiSemitic and racists and on and on. And these people are comfortable coming out in the open and supporting Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump has refused to condemn in a very serious way his racist and antiSemitic fans, Tapper continued. He just has. He says things like, Oh, sure, I disavow, I disavow. But he has never serious said, I dont want the support of those people, they are reprehensible, they have nothing to do with me. He has never seriously done it. Conway used the pushing to pivot back to the idea that the Trump campaign is winning, saying I think this exchange is frankly the best piece of evidence I have that were actually going to win in nine days because the idea that were going to shift away from the pattern of corruption the cloud of ethical stain that Hillary Clinton would bring to the Oval Office in such an important week. No, Kellyanne, its not a sign that Trump is winning. Its pointing something out that has been true since this whole fiasco began That Donald Trump is a raging bigot, and he has been so openly. Dog whistles have turned into fog horns this election cycle, and its all because of Donald Trump. He embraces these bigots because hes one of them. The quicker you learn that, the better.

"on November 3, 2016 1222 am  Donald Trumps deplorable supporters arent waiting for the election results to start spilling blood. Theyve been threatening bloody violence ever since Trump began claiming that the election is rigged in favor of Hillary Clinton. And Trump has called for them to intimidate voters at polling places. In Texas last week, a Trump supporter was arrested for electioneering at a polling place because he was wearing one of Trumps stupid hats and a Deplorables Tshirt to vote. Election code prohibits any person from electioneering within 100 feet of a polling place. Of course, Trump supporters threw a temper tantrum because they think the rules dont apply to them. Well, now it looks like they have retaliated by setting up a booby trapped Trump sign at a polling place knowing that an official or volunteer would have to take the sign down. At Collin College in Plano, Texas a Trump sign was discovered ziptied to an official polling location sign in direct violation of the election code that forbids electioneering at polling places. But when a volunteer went out to remove the sign they got a nasty surprise in the form of box cutter blades that were strategically hidden inside. The blades sliced into the volunteers hands and drew blood, requiring medical attention and prompting officials to order that signs be checked thoroughly before removal. It just shows how far we have come in politics where people want to be so mean and so hateful to try and injure somebody whos probably not got any political party persuasion one way or the other, local Democratic Party campaign chair Steve Spainhouer said in response . I think most people have already made their minds up at this point how theyre going to vote and so theres nothing to gain by being mean spirited or hateful. Heres the video via KTVT . Frankly, this should be considered an act of domestic terrorism. Trumps supporters have gone too far and it could get worse as Election Day approaches. And if Trump loses, his supporters have already threatened to try to overthrow the federal government in a bloody coup. Clearly, these people are deranged and the safety of voters and election officials are in danger. But you wont hear Donald Trump condemning this act of violence. After all, he is the one inciting it.

"on October 25, 2016 1041 pm  New video has surfaced adding to the mountain of evidence that while working alongside his father, Fred Trump, young Donald Trump was part of a real estate business that discriminated against minority applicants. As part of an investigation by NBC News, Stanley Leibowitz, who worked as a rental agent for the Trump Organization, told the news network that he personally witnessed the elder Trump explicitly lay out a racist policy for their apartment properties. In the interview, Leibowitz said that Trump told him I dont rent to the nword, and indicates that Trump made this statement with Donald Trump in the room and that the younger Trump affirmed the policy. The revelation comes at the same time that the Clinton campaign has released a video highlighting Trumps runin with the federal government over discrimination. Undercover investigators were sent to Trump properties, and there they repeatedly ran into a policy where black applicants with identical financial backgrounds to white applicants were systematically denied housing. The white applicants were allowed into the Trump properties. One bit of testimony determined that Trump property managers indicated applications from blacks by putting a C on the documents for colored, and that was a sign that they should be denied. The Trumps denied the allegation, but later settled with the government over the policy without admitting wrongdoing. Donald Trumps involvement with his fathers business is key to the entire story of his rise to prominence in the real estate world and the media, as is his fathers 14 million dollars that he gave to Trump to start his business. But if you accept that, the Trump Organizations history of racial discrimination and the legal entanglements that come with that are also part of the story, and no matter how Trump may try to wave it away  its still there.

"on November 4, 2016 1225 pm  Weve all seen pictures of the Trumps in their home surrounded by tacky gold decor, complete with their young son Barron in a suit with toys in front of him while he stares at the camera off to the side of his parents. Its a life most of us can never imagine while were paying our monthly bills. So whats it like growing up with Donald Trump as a father According to Scott Melker, a former classmate of Donald Trump Jr.s, at the University of Pennsylvania, being the former reality show stars son wasnt what one might imagine. Or, given Trumps temperament, it might be exactly what youd imagine. On Facebook , Mekler told of the animosity Trumps son had for this father. I was hanging out in a freshman dorm with some friends, next door to Donald Jr.s room. I walked out of the room to find Donald Trump at his sons door, there to pick him up for a baseball game, he recalls. There were quite a few students standing around watching, trying to catch a glimpse of the famed real estate magnate. Don Jr. opened the door, wearing a Yankee jersey. Then Mekler told of the moment Trump slapped his son in the face in front of others. Without saying a word, his father slapped him across the face, knocking him to the floor in front of all of his classmates. He simply said put on a suit and meet me outside, and closed the door, Melker wrote. Donald Jr. was a drunk in college. Every memory I have of him is of him stumbling around campus falling over or passing out in public, with his arm in a sling from injuring himself while drinking, he continued. He absolutely despised his father, and hated the attention that his last name afforded him. His nickname was Diaper Don, because of his tendency to fall asleep drunk in other peoples beds and urinate. I always felt terrible for him, he continued. Mekler said part of his reason for voting for Hillary Clinton is because in light of what I saw that day, it is clear to me that Donald Trump lacks the temperament and basic social decency to run our country. To be clear, we are not demonizing Trumps son for having an alleged drinking problem during his college days. Whether Melkers story is accurate or not, were not sure, but given Trumps awful temper, its difficult to discount it. Photo by Saul LoebPool via Getty.

"on November 4, 2016 1058 pm  GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has taken a ridiculously hardline  and even bigoted  stance on immigration. He has promised to build a wall and force Mexico to pay for it, and he has said that he will erect deportation forces to root out and get rid of all people in the United States without proper documentation. Well, as we already knew, it turns out that The Donald is the ultimate hypocrite on this one. According to the Associated Press , it turns out that Donald Trumps wife Melania violated immigration laws by working illegally in the United States when she first arrived from her native Slovenia. Melania often modeled using just her first name, and was first granted entry into the country on a visitors visa, known as a B1/B2 visa. This occurred on August 27, 1996. Melania did not get a legal work visa until October 18, 1996. During the time when she was prohibited from working in the country, Melania made money on ten different modeling assignments, totaling upwards of 20,000. She got a green card in 2000, and became a naturalized citizen in 2006. So, in other words, Melania Trump lied about her immigration story, as recently as Thursday, when she once again touted how a million percent legal immigration is the only way to go, and that this is how she did it. Melania said, in part, in her stump speech As a young entrepreneur, I wanted to follow my dream to a place where freedom and opportunity were in abundance. So of course, I came here. Living and working in America was a true blessing, but I wanted something more. I wanted to be an American. Well, it appears that, as has long been suspected, that Melania Trump wasnt as kosher in her immigration and work practices as she claims. The information obtained by the AP include, but are not limited to, her contract from Metropolitan International Management  a modeling agency. Also, theres the ledgers from the agency, which is no longer in business, that shows Melania working during the time when she had the visitors visa, but no work visa. It seems to be a complicated story full of many attempts to cover up Melanias wrongdoing, but it is certainly quite interesting. This would be why Melania Trump never released actual records regarding her initial immigration to the United States and her eventual path to citizenship. While it is unlikely that her citizenship is at risk, it certainly means that she committed immigration fraud. You can read more here at the Associated Press . The long and short of it is this Donald Trump launched his crazy bid for the presidency preying on the fears of the other. Namely, immigrants. That is the height of hypocrisy, seeing as how his own wife didnt completely comply with immigration law. Hopefully this story, and the many other lies and coverups and shady dealings surrounding the Trump campaign break through the hypnotism that the demagogue has spun onto so many desperate citizens of this great country, and they figure out that they are falling for the biggest con of all time.

"on November 4, 2016 445 pm  If you had wanted to give Trump supporters the benefit of the doubt, this most recent incident proves that its far too much to give them. A 56yearold man in Allen Park, Michigan has just been charged with six felonies after he held six children at gunpoint because he thought theyd damaged the Donald Trump sign on his lawn. Yes, this is the kind of deranged, emotionally unstable supporters Trump has attracted. The man, Michael Robert Kubek, had called police on October 29th to report that his Trump sign had been hit by teenagers, who had fled the scene. When the police arrived at the scene, they didnt find Kubek at his home  however, when the officers followed the screams coming from around the corner, there he was. The police saw Kubek standing over six children ages 1214, who were sitting on the grass. Kubek accused the children of destroying his sign despite the fact that he never actually witnessed them doing it. The children denied any involvement, and the officers told Kubek to return to his house so they could speak to the children. According to the kids, they were simply on their way to the park for a birthday celebration when Kubek had pulled out a gun and pointed it at them, instructing them to sit down on the grass. Those witnessing the act took to social media to vent their shock Twitter Twitter The NewsHerald reported The officer asked him again if he could identify any of the kids as the one who damaged his sign, but Kubek repeated that he could not. The officer then asked Kubek if he pulled out a pistol and pointed it at the kids. According to police, Kubek said yes. In response to another question from the officer, Kubek said he felt threatened because he was outnumbered. Yes, a grown man used a gun because he felt outnumbered by a small group of innocent kids. This is EXACTLY the type of unhinged person who shouldnt be trusted with firearms Kubeks hearing is scheduled for December 5th  lets hope that whatever happens to Kubek, that he is no longer considered a responsible gun owner.

"on November 5, 2016 450 pm  Appearing at a concert for Hillary Clinton in Ohio alongside Chance the Rapper, Big Sean and her husband Jay Z, Beyonc let us all know why shes with her. After explaining that she was so happy her nephew got to have Barack Obama to look up to and know he could one day be president, Beyonc then explained that this election is continuing on that path of progress. She explained that gender goes beyond that of any religion or race, and electing the first woman president is something she wants for her daughter. She said I want my daughter to grow up seeing a woman lead our country and know that her possibilities are limitless. Electing Hillary Clinton would break the mold of the United States being led by only men since its inception. However, thats clearly not the only reason to elect Hillary. She is, by far, the most qualified person to run for President of the United States in more than a century.

"on November 6, 2016 340 pm  Trying to catch the liar of liars in a lie isnt hard. Getting him and his campaign to acknowledge that Trump is the liar of liars is. Same thing with bullying, but The New York Times put together a spread of all the bullyish things Trump has said and tweeted, and to whom. Now, the Toronto Star s Daniel Dale has been tracking Trumps lies for just six weeks, and the paper has compiled a complete list of those lies, which you can find here . There are literally hundreds of lies in Trumps speeches. Theyre not all 100 unique, but this is probably the final and ultimate proof that Trump will say anything to smear anyone, including his enemies, while keeping his supporters happy. Is there any presidential candidate in history that has lied this much Tons of people claim Hillary is a master liar, but first, shes actually more honest than most politicians. Second, even if she could be considered anything like a master liar, she still could not compete with Trump the Liar in any way, shape or form. The Star put the lies into a whopping 20 categories Clintons policies, WTF, Daesh/Middle East, Clintons record, African Americans/Inner cities, The Clintons corruption, Rigged election, Trade/Economy, Health care, Trumps endorsements, Refugees/Immigration, Polls, Obamas record, The campaign, Russia, Trumps record, Taxes, Sex assault allegations, Clintons health and Government corruption. They also compiled a list of the top 10 types of lies Trump has told and gave more detailed analysis, beginning with, The electoral system is rigged. Of course, its rigged against him After plummeting in the polls after the first two debates, Trump began to repeatedly question the fairness of the election. Rigged became his catchword. He claimed Hillary Clinton campaign workers hired thugs to cause violence at his rallies, twisting the evidence from an undercover video to unfairly disparage Clinton. He claimed there was widespread voter fraud in Philadelphia, Chicago and St. Louis  cities with large black populations that heavily favour Democrats. In Greeley, Colo., Trump told his supporters if they dont trust mailin ballots, they should vote again in person. So, one did. Trump supporter Terri Lynn Rote, a 55yearold from Iowa, was charged by police for suspicion of voting twice. Nobodys committing voter suppression and fraud quite like Trumpsters and Republicans. Another is, Muslims are risky. This touches on his assertions that we know nothing about refugees coming from Syria, who could be the great Trojan Horse of our time His claims that Syrian refugees  99 per cent are Muslim  are terrorists plays to the fears of the other, even though they are extensively vetted and are predominantly women and children. And their numbers is nowhere near Trumps claims  about 13,000 have been admitted to the United States in 2016. The polls favour Trump. Har de har har  Trump only looks at the polls he likes, and theyre usually unscientific online polls or other dubious polls. Very few of the established, scientific polls favor him. Nevertheless It seems clear Trump manipulates, exaggerates or makes up polls that make it sound as if he is doing better than he actually is. This poll denialism gives his supporters licence to dismiss negative polling data, suggests CNN. His false claims cast doubt on the legitimacy of mainstream polling  and perhaps even the vote itself. If supporters feel Trump should be doing better, then the idea of a rigged election seems more credible. On Oct. 24, he said I won the last two debates, and every poll showed it. In fact, every scientific poll showed that he lost. Of course, when unscientific online polls came out in his favour, Trump was quick to promote  and exaggerate  those numbers. But these are just a few of his biggest, most repeated lies. He has also Falsely said on Twitter, The failing NYTimes reporters dont even call us anymore, they just write whatever they want to write, making up sources along the way Falsely said, By open borders, Hillary means totally unlimited immigration. Falsely said, Hillarys plan includes an open border with the Middle East. Falsely called NBC anchor Lester Holt, the moderator of the first debate, a Democrat. Falsely said, Wow, just came out on secret tape that Crooked Hillary wants to take in as many Syrians as possible. Falsely said the U.S. provided Iran 150 billion as part of the nuclear deal. Falsely said, In San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many peopleMuslims have to report the problems when they see them. Falsely asserted that Clinton has been fighting ISIS her entire adult life. Falsely said, All together, the Hillary Clinton plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term. Falsely claimed he had been acknowledged to be correct in declaring NATO obsolete because it doesnt cover terror falsely suggested NATO created an antiterror position because of his comments. Falsely claimed Clinton didnt release cholesterol or EKG information Falsely said sexual assault allegations against him have been largely debunked. Falsely said, apparently of sexual assault accuser Summer Zervos, The one young lady has five family members saying what she said is absolute nonsense. Falsely said I did not. I did not to Clintons charge that he thinks Climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. Falsely said, I was against going into Iraq. And its so welldocumented. Falsely said, Our taxes are so high. Just about the highest in the world. And so many more, just in the last six weeks Yes, many of them are repeats, but lies are lies. If Trump sees this, hell likely throw a livid fit about it and claim that the papers lying, and continue to sell the myth that hes not the liar of liars being caught in a squillion lies.

"on November 6, 2016 803 am  Saturday Night Live has helped bring quite a bit of levity to this otherwise horrific election year but in the final episode before the election, before we as a nation go to the polls and decide if we want to be extraordinary or deplorable, the cast of Saturday Night Live could not help but drop the act and get real with America. It began as it normally does, with Alec Baldwins masterful Donald Trump character and Kate McKinnons excellent portrayal of Hillary Clinton if she spent all day every day mainlining a dangerous mixture of sugar and caffeine. I never use emails, Trump says in the cold opener. I use a very private, very secure site where one can write whatever they want to and no one can read it Its called Twitter. After he is informed that everyone can see his tweets, Trump replies Really And Im still in this thing America you must really hate this lady. After a scathing rebuke of the medias decision to ignore Trumps cozy relationship with Putin, the KKK, and the FBI and instead focus on something as meaningless as Hillary Clintons emails, something magical happened McKinnon and Baldwin dropped the facade and got serious. Im sorry, Kate. I just hate yelling all this stuff at you like this, Baldwin says. I just feel gross all the time about this. Dont you all feel gross he added, addressing the audience. McKinnon agrees and the two embark on a friendship montage through the city before returning to the stage. Then they dropped perhaps the most important message you will hear this election year. None of this would have mattered if you dont vote, Baldwin says. We cant tell you who to vote for, but on Tuesday we all get a chance to choose what kind of country we want to live in, McKinnon finishes. Theyre right.",bias
"on November 11, 2016 330 pm  As if the election of Donald Trump couldnt get even more disastrous and hypocritical, Senator Lindsey Graham just called on Trump to nominate a rightwing extremist to nations highest court. All year long, Republicans have been blocking President Obamas nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court because they want the next president to make the pick. And because they now have the conservative puppet president they have always wanted, they want to make sure that nominee is a conservative extremist. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham told WYFFTV that Trump should pick Texas Senator Ted Cruz as the nominee and warned Democrats not to block him, which is hypocritical considering how Republicans have treated President Obamas nominee and threatened to block any nominees Hillary Clinton would have made had she won the election. Im here to tell my Democratic colleagues that I voted for Obamas nominees. I expect them to give Trumps nominees a fair shake. He won this election. He will pick a conservative. I would put Ted Cruz on that list. If they try to block this pick, they will regret it. If you dont honor Trumps nominee, youre making a huge mistake. Democrats should stand up and give Graham a collective middle finger. Since Antonin Scalia died in February, there has been a vacancy on the Supreme Court bench that has yet to be filled. The body wasnt even cold yet before Republicans vowed to block any nominee President Obama picked to replace him, going so far as to even deny Garland a confirmation hearing. Thats far from the fair shake Graham is asking Democrats to give to a man as dangerous as Ted Cruz. Putting Cruz on the Supreme Court would guarantee rulings against womens rights and LGBT rights as well as putting laws like the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act in further peril. In no uncertain terms should Democrats grant Cruz a hearing, nor should they respect any of Trumps conservative choices for the court. Republicans should have thought about fair shakes before taking the totally unprecedented step of being complete assholes toward the Supreme Court nominee of a sitting president who also won an election and s far more popular than Trump. Again, Senate Republicans didnt even give Garland a hearing or a vote. They refused to do their jobs entirely out of disrespect towards President Obama. And so thats exactly what Democrats should do to Trump. Turnabout is fair play and Republicans only have themselves to blame. Featured Image Ethan Miller/Getty Images Share this Article",bias
"on November 12, 2016 354 pm  Trump fans may have won the election, but they arent taking a break from expressing their racist hatred of Michelle Obama. The Donalds Deplorables were out in force after the First Lady posed for the cover of Vogue. I could have spent eight years doing anything , and at some level, it would have been fine, Obama told the magazine . I could have focused on flowers. I could have focused on decor.

In exercising her freedom, Michelle Obama has done quite a bit to push education, healthy eating, and support for our veterans  and in exercising their freedom, the Right has responded with nothing but hate. The reaction to the First Lady appearing in elegant clothing was typical. Readers of Yahoo News showered Obama with racist remarks, calling her an ape and a monkey and even wishing death upon her for the horrific crime of wearing pretty clothes. If you thought this behavior would stop after the election, you were wrong.

"on November 13, 2016 309 pm  As predicted, Donald Trumps victory on Election Day has emboldened racist conservatives to start harassing and attacking minorities. And its even happening in the deep blue state of California, where a woman spotted a sign hanging on the side of a building in the town of Pittsburg and snapped a photo of it. Twitter user James Thompson posted the image of the sign on the social media platform after his sister sent it to him. This picture was taken in Pittsburgh California. My sister texted this to me 10 minutes ago.Our democracy is being tested even in California pic.twitter.com/gDLKw54Lox  James Thompson @JETBallin November 13, 2016 The sign clearly promotes lynching to prevent AfricanAmericans from getting equal rights. You can hang a nr from a tree / Equal rights he will never see it says. The FBI has been notified and local police have filed a lawsuit in an effort to force the owners of the sign to remove it. In the wake of Trumps surprising and depressing victory there has been a rise in the number of racist incidents in this country. In fact, there have been 139 reports of people being bullied by Trump supporters since the election night results. These incidents include the harassment of a Muslim teacher by a student in Georgia, and students designating water fountains white or colored at a Florida high school. Frankly, there are so many incidents that its difficult to list them all. You can find a somewhat comprehensive tally here . This is what Trumps America looks like and its scary. And this has all happend in the course of a few days as Melania Trump continues to tell the media that her focus will be on ending bullying. What exactly does she mean by that Is she going to call out all bullying, including the racist bullying being perpetrated by her husbands own supporters Or is she going to ignore those incidents and merely whine about people who criticize her husband. Because right now, she isnt even First Lady yet and her effort has failed miserably. And she only has her husband to blame.",bias
"on November 13, 2016 403 pm  Post election, the media and Donald Trump voters everywhere have been rewriting recent history. They are making the claim that Trump wasnt elected because of racism he was elected because of the economy. The problem with that argument, though, is that its simply not true. Trump voters are racist and theres proof. The American National Elections Study ANES began the study in January. Initially, they asked How likely is it that many whites are unable to find a job because employers are hiring minorities instead. Now, of course, anyone who spends more than five minutes listening to those in minority communities know the answer to that. Its VERY unlikely that whites arent getting jobs because minorities are, but thats not what Trump voters think. The vast majority said that its extremely likely that minorities are taking jobs from white people. Graph courtesy of ANES and Salon . Then, they asked the same Trump voters about a nonracial issue, trade. Despite the fact that trade was one of Trumps signature issues, their opinions on trade were mixed. Post election, this is what the study found The question about white jobs is powerfully linked to support for Trump over Clinton. Eightyfour percent of whites who believe it is extremely likely that whites cant find a job because employers are hiring people of color instead support Trump, compared with 23 percent of those who think it is not at all likely. Among white Democrats, 58 percent who believe people of color are taking jobs support Trump over Clinton, compared with less than 1 percent of those who believe it is not at all likely. Eightyone percent of white women who think it is extremely likely people of color are taking jobs supported Trump, compared with 26 percent who dont think that. More than that, 78 percent of white Trump supporters say black people are violent. 84 percent think that of Muslims. Unfortunately, Democrats might not be able to just ride out this wave of racism, hoping that eventually, the aging bigots will die off. It turns out their children are just as bad. Sean McElwee, the man who was responsible for publishing the study, suggested this Democrats must create a narrative that weaves economic, racial and gender justice together. A multiracial coalition is the path to sustained political power and reductions in economic, racial and gender inequality. As Ive shown with political scientist Jason McDaniel, racism often diminishes support for progressive policies. The solution is not to abandon either the white working class or the diverse and rising American electorate that still stands poised to transform the nation. Great idea, if we had a media that reported facts instead of letting bigots claims go unchallenged.

"on November 13, 2016 1243 pm  Before the leaked tape of Donald Trump describing his propensity to grab women by the pussy to Billy Bush, it seemed that the media was ignoring Donald Trumps glaring faults as a presidential candidate. During the primaries , for example, he received far more positive media coverage than any of his competitors. It turns out there might be a reason for that  Trump was bribing the media  at least thats the accusation being made by Megyn Kelly of Fox News. In her memoire Settle for More, which will be released this week, Kelly said that Trump likely received the infamous question, in which she asked about the fact that he has called women fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals. That question set Trump off on one of his Twitter tirades. These are only a portion The worst and most controversial of which was this As the election progressed, it became more and more apparent that Trump expected that no matter how egregious his behavior, he expected, no, demanded that the media kiss his orange ass. If they didnt, he would cut off access, but before that, he tried bribery. While Kelly couldnt speak for other members of the media, she alleges that Trump attempted to buy positive coverage by offering free stays at his hotels, with full perks. While the attempt clearly didnt work on Kelly, she says that with some, their loyalty came cheap, or perhaps not so cheap. This is actually one of the untold stories of the 2016 campaign I was not the only journalist to whom Trump offered gifts clearly meant to shape coverage, Kelly said. He also attempted to woo them with praise, she said, adding, This is smart, because the media is full of people whose egos need stroking. Trump tried to work the refs, and some of the refs responded, she said. When it became obvious that some reporters were in the tank for Trump, she alleges in one chapter, certain TV hosts would work with the candidate in advance on occasional Trump criticism so they would appear unbiased. She didnt identify them by name or media outlet. Source Yahoo Kelly also asserts that the day before the debate in which Kelly asked about Trumps treatment of women, the candidate called Fox News exec. Bill Sammon, who told him about the first question. All we heard about, though, during the election, was that it was Hillary Clinton who was fed a town hall debate question and it was hardly earth shattering. The insider knowledge said that a woman, in the Flint, Michigan debate, would ask a question about the Flint water . While bribing journalists isnt illegal, per say, it is highly unethical. Without the Fourth Estate exposing the underbelly of politicians and of politics, democracy is impossible.

"on February 15, 2015 1117 am  Its a common stereotype that food stamp recipients, and those who abuse it, are black, Hispanic, or any other race but white. According to the USDA in their report for fiscal year 2013, 40 of recipients are white and 26 are black. Courtesy of Travissonno.com While the media and Americas culture will have you believe that black people or anyone who isnt white account for copious amounts of fraud, theres a story breaking that you wont hear on Fox News anytime soon or you might, because any chance to crush the SNAP program, they will take. According to WCAX News in New York More than 30 people have been nabbed for food stamp fraud in the North Country. Investigators say over the past couple months people used their food stamps to get food or alcohol at the Old Time Butcher Block store in Brushton. Police also say its not the first time the owner of that store, Dennis Sauve, has been charged with allowing such fraud. Police say more arrests are expected. Now heres the kicker theyre all white. Brushton, New York, where this bust happened, has a population of roughly 480 people. Approximately 99.83 of the population is white, and 0.42 are black. These demographics are eerily similar to the food stamp capital of the country , Owsley Country, Kentucky, which is 99.22 white and 95 Republican. Maybe we should investigate them. I just wish we could get the political affiliations of those arrested in Brushton. According to WPTZ News Police say the arrests are the result of a yearlong investigation, initiated by the Franklin County Department of Social Services Fraud Unit. Franklin County District Attorneys Office, the United States Department of Agriculture, and the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance helped with the investigation. The store owner, Denis Sauve also white, has been charged with thirddegree grand larceny and misuse of food stamps. This really isnt a racial issue so much as it is an, I told you so, issue. While the food stamp program has one of the lowest rates of abuse than any other welfare program, a lot of people buy into this misconception that it is the lazy blacks who account for all the fraud and woes of government assistance. Well, here we are, a major food stamp bust and every criminal involved is white. It might be time to rethink today stereotypes.

"on November 16, 2016 456 pm  It was just a few days ago that Bernie Sanders responded to Trumps election win with the perfect message from Democrats. He said  If Donald Trump takes peoples anger and turns it against Muslims, Hispanics, African Americans and women, we will be his worst nightmare. And from what was just announced, it seems that Sanders has every intention of making good on that warning. Earlier today, the Vermont Senator was named chair of outreach during a closeddoor Senate Democrat caucus meeting, according to The Hill . In his new role, Sanders will lead outreach to bluecollar voters  the very voters who became Trump supporters this year. Sanders will also be the ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee. Acknowledging that he has a heavy responsibility to help shape the priorities of the United States government, Sanders said Im going to do everything that I can to make sure that the budget that leaves the United States Congress is a budget that represents the needs of working families and a shrinking middle class and not billionaires. With the announcement of Sanders new position, Trump is definitely going to be a nervous wreck. Hes spent his entire presidential campaign claiming that he would help the working class, and now Sanders is in the position to challenge him and hold him to it for the next four years. By elevating Sanders to this new role, Democrats are moving to a more grassroots message, fully aware that Sanders presidential campaign and vision for America resonated with many voters. As we saw with Sanders popularity in the primaries, the Vermont Senator struck a nerve with workers and families, making him the perfect candidate to go up against Trump as he takes office. Sen. Debbie Stabenow DMich. commented on Sanders new responsibility We want to expand on that, and he will be reaching out to all our allies. We have a tremendous amount of talent in our caucus and we want to make sure everyone is contributing. Sanders hardly needed this promotion to upset Trump, as hes been one of the most outspoken politicians on Twitter since Trumps win Twitter Twitter Twitter However, Sanders new role is great news for our country, and we know hes going to give Trump hell.

"on November 21, 2016 758 pm  Donald Trump has had a rocky relationship with the press ever since his presidential campaign, and hes only punished them further for trying to report the truth since becoming the Presidentelect. On Monday, Trump was set to have an off the record meeting with television networks to try and hash out presidential press access. This meeting was particularly important because Trump has previously limited press access, and has ditched two protocol press pools since getting elected. Some reporters in attendance were NBCs Deborah Turness, Lester Holt and Chuck Todd ABCs James Goldston, George Stephanopoulos, David Muir and Martha Raddatz CBS Norah ODonnell and Charlie Rose Fox News Bill Shine, Jack Abernethy, Jay Wallace, Suzanne Scott MSNBCs Phil Griffin and CNNs Jeff Zucker and Erin Burnett. It was a good group, and it could have been a very effective meeting if only things had gone according to plan. Unfortunately, instead of having a respectful conversation and coming up with an amicable way to move forward, what the press got was a baby Trump temper tantrum of epic proportions. Or, as one person put it , It was like a fcking firing squad. Trump made zero attempt to hide his disrespect for the media. According to The New York Post , one anonymous source said The meeting was a total disaster. The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration, but instead they got a Trumpstyle dressing down. This claim was backed up by another person, who said The meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks. Trump kept saying, Were in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong. He addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. He called out Jeff Zucker by name and said everyone at CNN was a liar, and CNN was network of liars. This attack left reporters stunned, and even as they tried to keep bringing up press access to stay on topic, Trump barely let them speak. While this is certainly shocking, this behavior is completely typical of Trump. He has always hated the free press because it has held him accountable and reported on his mistakes and shortcomings. Americans on social media are already coming to terms with how terrifying this is Twitter Twitter Twitter Interestingly enough, Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway had the nerve to say the meeting went well. She said Excellent meetings with the top executives of the major networks. Pretty unprecedented meeting we put together in two days. Disgraceful.

"Aaron Bandler October 27, 2016 A flash mob of over 150 blacks teens assaulted numerous people on Friday in Philadelphia in an attack that appears to have been racially motivated, and yet the media is silent about this possible motivation. LifeZette reports that the racial component of the attack was evident in a Facebook post written by Joe Lauletta , whose daughter, Christina, was attacked by the flash mob on Friday. Lauletta wrote that he received a phone call from Christina, who tearfully explained that she was jumped and beat up pretty bad. I find out that her and her 2 male friends where badly beaten by a group of 3040 black teenagers on their way home from the Temple football game, Lauletta wrote. This happened after they got off the subway at Broad and Cecil B Moore. These sick animals held her down and kicked and stomped on her repeatedly. Thank god, the people from the pizza place intervened. While no bones were broken, Christina was badly bruised throughout her body, Lauletta said it makes me cry just thinking about it. Laulettas post seemed to indicate the racial aspect of the attack, and on Tuesday he posted on Facebook that the FBI is investigating and are analyzing all video coverage, signaling that the FBI is looking into the attack as a hate crime. In an interview with the New York Post , Lauletta wouldnt explicitly say the attack was racially motivated but sort of implied it Well, I havent been saying that because everybody is trying to get me to say it and I dont know if I want to be that person, Lauletta told The Post. Everyone can draw their own conclusions. Lauletta said the possibility of the attacks being motivated by race  perhaps as a sort of gang initiation  was part of the reason why his story was shared so frequently and as far away as Africa. Thats why it spread so fast, Lauletta said. If you read my Facebook page, everybodys saying it. However, Philadelphia Police Lt. John Stanford insisted to the Post that there hasnt been any indication that race is involved in this in any shape or form. Even still, the media hasnt reported that the attack is possibly a hate crime, as LifeZette points out Friday violence as teen mob attacks Temple students, police four arrested, read the headline on Philly.com, while the Philly Voice reported Teens arrested after flash mob leads to assaults on Broad Street. The Associated Press headline read STUDENTS BEATEN, HORSE PUNCHED IN MOB ATTACKS AT UNIVERSITY. The Washington Post buried the possibility in their story and then dismissed it with Stanfords quote. LifeZette also noted that Temple University described the attack as a large group of approximately 200 juveniles causing disruption along Broad Street. Maybe Stanford is correct that it was a random attack, or maybe the black flash mob was targeting whites. But there is no doubting the medias hypocrisy if this were a flash mob of white teenagers that attacked blacks, the media would be screaming about it being a hate crime. But since the incident in Philadelphia does not advance the medias racial narrative, they will not treat it in the same manner. Tags ",bias

"Ben Shapiro Destroys John Oliver On Abortion And Trump By Hank Berrien October 27, 2016 On Thursday, on his daily podcast, Daily Wire EditorinChief Ben Shapiro decimated HBO host and supposed comedian John Oliver for his comments regarding Donald Trumps comments on abortion during the third presidential debate. Shapiro began, HBOs John Oliver belongs to a class of British people who think that they are smarter than everyone else by dint of their accent. They think that because they share an accent with Rex Harrison from My Fair Lady this makes them geniuses. He continued So John Oliver does a political show on American politics he doesnt know much about American politics he doesnt know much about politics generally but hes been feted by the media because hes a comedian whos wildly to the left. So just like President Obama is going to be interviewed by Samantha Bee, who is legitimately the least funny person in human history, she and Trevor Noah actually have a cage match next week to determine whos the least funny person in human history. Both of them I believe, beat Stalin for that title a while back, so now were going to unify the championships, so Obamas going to be on with Samantha Bee, where presumably they will jabber about how much they love each other and why abortions wonderful. John Oliver was ripping on Donald Trump the other day at some awards ceremony, and because hes British, that means were supposed to pay attention to him, even though we fought a revolution so we wouldnt have to pay attention to the Brits. Heres John Oliver talking about abortion The screen then showed Oliver pontificating In terms of the communication about reproductive rights and the conversation that is so important we really did potentially hit an idea in the modern era during that third debate because his discussions of lateterm abortions showed no real understanding of how abortions work, no clear understanding of the basic biology of womens bodies, and a very poor sense of grammar as well. So I guess we got, in a sense, what we were asking for. If you ask Donald Trump to draw a Fallopian tube, I cannot imagine what you would get back other than a childs drawing of a cobra. Shapiro fired back Okay. I would hesitate to ask John Oliver to draw a Fallopian tube or to describe any of the biology here, because he obviously doesnt know. Now look, I criticized Trump for being ignorant about how he described abortion because he wasnt graphic enough. But let me, for those who missed it, explain what exactly happens in a lateterm abortion, which is what he was talking about, okay What happens in a lateterm abortion, what happens in a lateterm abortion, is something completely awful this is according to americanpregnancy.org., okay Not a rightwing prolife website americanpregnancy.org The fetus is rotated forceps are used to grasp and pull the legs, shoulders and arms through the birth canal. A small incision is made at the base of the skull to allow a suction catheter inside. The catheter removes the cerebral material, that would be the brains, until the skull collapses. The fetus is then completely removed. Shapiro continued to explain the barbaric procedure Okay, thats one procedure thats used thats dilation and extraction. In lateterm abortions it usually one of these two dilation and evacuation or dilation and extraction. Dilation and evacuation The baby may be given a lethal injection to kill it sometimes they dont use such injections then the doctor uses a curette or a forceps to carve up the childs body in the womb, and remove it piece by piece. Then he proceeded to carve up Oliver So I guess that Donald Trump could have been more graphic I dont know that John Oliver would have enjoyed that, but he could have been more graphic, I suppose. But this is what they do, laugh it up, Oh, he cant draw a Fallopian tube. Okay, John draw an abortion. Really. Draw it lets see it. I want to see you get down there with a piece of paper and I want you to draw me what you think an abortion looks like. Its not waving a magic wand, and its not getting rid of a cluster of cells that mean nothing. I want you to sit there and draw what it looks like when a baby is cut into pieces and removed from the womb. I would like to see that. Okay, John draw an abortion. Really. Draw it lets see it. I want to see you get down there with a piece of paper and I want you to draw me what you think an abortion looks like. Ben Shapiro Shapiro concluded But of course hell never do that, other than, It might look like a cobra it might look like a cobra maybe itll look like a princess, waving her fairy magic wand and a unicorn emerges from the vagina. The fact that he thinks his accent covers for his basic ignorance of biology and his euphemistic willingness to ignore what amounts to childkilling is absolutely ridiculous and despicable.

"George And Laura Bush Celebrate Their 70th Birthdays By Hank Berrien October 26, 2016 On Saturday, former president George W. Bush and former first lady Laura Bush celebrated their 70th birthdays together in Crawford, Texas. President Bushs birthday was July 6, and Lauras is on November 4. Some of the attendees included former commerce secretary Donald Evans, Dallas Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones, and Ross Perot Jr., the son of H. Ross Perot. George Strait performed, and sang Happy Birthday, per People. Typical of Bushs downhome style, he wore jeans, a westernstyle shirt and a prominent belt buckle. The dinner included an avocado and grapefruit salad, Mesquite smoked peppered beef tenderloin, Southern fried catfish, roasted corn and poblano pudding, bourbon carrots, and cheddar and black pepper biscuits. The dessert was a Texas chocolate sheet cake. Bush also invited guests to his art studio at the ranch, dubbed Studio 43, where he works on his paintings. Laura Bush was working as a librarian in the Austin Independent School District when she met George in 1977 their friends Joe and Jan ONeill invited them to a barbecue. They were married in November 1977 at the First United Methodist Church in Midland, where she had been baptized. She wore a tan, twotoned dress she had bought off the rack. George W. Bush later called his proposal to his wife the best decision of my life. Laura, an only child, said she gained brothers and sisters and wonderful inlaws and made her feel part of the family.

" Phil Kerpen @kerpen October 31, 2016 Remington Researchs summary of the polling data asserted that the race has become increasingly competitive Last week, we found a presidential race where Hillary Clinton held a clear advantage. This week, we find an increasingly competitive race with just eight days to go. Trump appears to be holding strong in his mustwin states and Colorado remains within the margin of error. The data also show that Pennsylvania has moved into the margin of error category. The presidential race remains very competitive as we move into the final stretch. Hillary maintains an advantage leading in Colorado and Pennsylvania, but at this point anything can happen, said Titus Bond, Director of Remington Research Group Other state polling data came out on Sunday that also showed a closerace between Trump and Clinton, although the polls were surveyed before FBI director James Comeys announcement that they were reopening their investigation against Clinton . Via RealClearPolitics  Florida New York Times/Siena Trump 46 percent, Clinton 42 percent. NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist Clinton 45 percent, Trump 44 percent. Gravis Clinton 48 percent, Trump 47 percent. Colorado CBS News/YouGov Clinton 42 percent, Trump 39 percent. Arizona CBS/YouGov Trump 44 percent, Clinton 42 percent. North Carolina NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist Clinton 47 percent, Trump 41 percent. Gravis Clinton 49 percent, Trump 47 percent. CBS News/YouGov Clinton 48 percent, Trump 45 percent. Pennsylvania CBS News/YouGov Clinton 48 percent, Trump 40 percent. The fact that some of these polls were close even before the Comey announcement led to this observation from FiveThirtyEights Nate Silver Both things can be true 1 Comey impact overblown  Nate Silver @NateSilver538 October 31, 2016 Radio host Steve Deace writes at Conservative Review that while early voting has been overwhelmingly in favor of Clinton, the renewed FBI investigation could have a potentially huge impact on Election Day Trump was on defense on the election map as he had to defend states like Arizona, Georgia, Utah, Indiana, and Alaska that rarely go blue on Election Day. Its quite conceivable that yet another reminder of the stench of corruption that has long surrounded the Clintons could sway the bulk of Republicanleaning undecideds Trumps way. But thats provided, of course, that he can withstand his compulsion to negatively influence a favorable news cycle as hes been prone to do. Then theres the matter of Trumps emerging Evan McMullin headache in Utah. If Trump can be disciplined this final week, his campaign may have the freedom to focus its efforts on Iowa, Nevada, Florida, Ohio, and North Carolina. Those five states would get him within striking distance to 265 Electoral College votes, and then you hope you can pull an upset in Colorado, Pennsylvania, or New Mexico where Trump is visiting during the campaigns final week. The hope is that theres enough voters in those states wearier of Clintons corruption than worried about whether Trumps fit for office. FiveThirtyEight currently has Trumps odds of winning the presidency at 23.6 percent in their pollsplus forecast. This week will be crucial for Trump in increasing those odds, and maybe the FBIs reopened investigation into Clinton will help improve those odds as it becomes closer to Election Day. Tags ",bias

"BREAKING DOJ FINALLY Secures Warrant To Inspect Humas Emails By Michael Qazvini October 30, 2016 On the heels of FBI Director James Comeys unexpected Friday announcement about revisiting the Hillary Clinton email investigation, the US Department of Justice has officially obtained a warrant to inspect Huma Abedins stash of emails. Abedin is perhaps Hillary Clintons closest confidante. During the course of the FBIs investigation, she spoke with federal agents on several occasions, evading questions and providing only vague answers to direct inquiries. The process has begun, stated the bureau Sunday in a rather cryptic message, suggesting that Abedins emails will be possibly be examined before election day. Enjoying intimate access to the former secretary of state, Abedin sent several emails through Hillarys private server. A few months ago, the FBI explicitly asked Abedin to hand over any information, including emails and devices those emails may be stored in to investigators. It now looks like she failed to comply with the request. In a bizarre twist of events, the FBI found hundreds of thousands of Abedins emails stored on a laptop belonging to her nowestranged husband. The emails were discovered as investigators seized evidence related to a separate investigation regarding an inquiry into disgraced Congressman Anthony Weiners possible sexual overtures to a minor. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton chats with her staff, including aide Huma Abedin L, onboard her plane in White Plains, New York, October 22, 2016, on her way to a campaign event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. / AFP / Robyn Beck Photo credit should read ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images Law enforcement officials have been hesitant to provide a timeline to the public for when the completion of its review of this treasure trove of emails. There may be evidence hiding in those emails that could incriminate Abedins boss, US presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. But we likely wont find out until after the election, raising unsettling questions about the integrity of our fragile democracy. As a matter of principle, the FBI should tell the American people everything it knows before voters cast their ballots on November 8th. Tags ",bias

"Desperate Obama RIPS Comey We Dont Operate On Innuendo By November 2, 2016 Barack Obama must be pretty worried. Earlier this week, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told the media that FBI director James Comeys decision to reopen an investigation into Hillary Clinton didnt spring from bias or politics. He explained  Director Comey is a man of integrity and principle and well regarded by officials in both parties and served as a senior position in the Bush administration and got bipartisan support when his nomination to be director of the FBI was considered by the United States Senate... they speak to his good character and the presidents assessment of his integrity and his character has not changed. For example, the president doesnt believe that Director Comey is trying to influence the outcome of the election. And the president doesnt believe hes secretly supporting a candidate or political party. Hes in a tough spot. Hes the one who will be in the position to defend his actions in the face of significant criticism from a variety of legal experts including officials who served in senior justice position for presidents led by both parties. Now, with the polls closing to within the margin of error, President Obama has had second thoughts. He told NowThisNews  I do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations we dont operate on innuendo and we dont operate on incomplete information and we dont operate on leaks. We operate based on concrete decisions that are made. When this was investigated thoroughly last time the conclusion of the FBI, the conclusion of the Justice Department, the conclusion of repeated congressional investigations was she had made some mistakes but that there wasnt anything there that was prosecutable. Its worthwhile pointing out the hypocrisy here  Obamas entire administration has been built on innuendo. His Department of Justice has destroyed police departments around the country with unsubstantiated innuendo about systemic racism. His IRS used innuendo to destroy conservative 501c3s. His entire 2012 campaign was rooted in innuendo about Mitt Romneys supposed secret evils. But more than anything, the Obama flip here shows serious desperation. What changed The polls. On Monday, it looked like the FBI scandal would detract from Hillarys polling numbers, but wouldnt kill her. Now it looks like she might go down in flames. This shows how faithless Obama is  Comey was wonderful just up until the point he threatened Hillarys chances, at which point he became a slanderer trafficking in innuendo. If Comey has any stones, he should resign in protest at Obamas accusations. Hes already been thrown under the bus by his commanderinchief for not playing dead for him long enough to move Hillary into the White House. Hes got no future in his position no matter what he does. It would be a final redeeming move of honor to tell Obama and his cronies to stuff it now. Tags ",bias
"NYT FBI Failed To Connect Trump To Putin By Robert Kraychik November 2, 2016 The New York Times reported on Monday that the FBI has failed to establish any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government. Speaking with unnamed FBI sources, the leftwing paper of record reported that the FBI pursued an investigation into stateside Russian attempts to affect the presidential election. Agents scrutinized advisors close to Donald J. Trump in order to search for financial connections between Donald Trumps political circle and Russian financial figures, reported The New York Times . A report from Slate s Franklin Foer sought to advance the narrative of collusion between Trump and Putin pushed by Hillary Clinton, Democrats, and affiliated political allies. It was then forwarded by leftwing Democrat media personalities and affiliates. Trump Tower had a special server to communicate with Russias Alfa Bank, reports the eternal badass @FranklinFoer . https//t.co/yIX6rZXbxJ  Julia Ioffe @juliaioffe October 31, 2016 So, why Why Trumps stubborn almost devotion to Putin Why the Russia friendly policies Why the Mantafort links Why the secret server  Scott Gilmore @ScottGilmore October 31, 2016 Putins Puppet didnt cover his tracks Trump server directly communicating with Russia. Voters deserve answers now. https//t.co/VXQNIoQXB6  Chad Griffin @ChadHGriffin November 1, 2016 Despite the narrative of Putin preferring to see Trump elected president, the FBI investigation apparently arrived at a different conclusion. The New York Times reported that unnamed FBI investigators said they have become increasingly confident, based on the evidence they have uncovered, that Russias direct goal is not to support the election of Mr. Trump, as many Democrats have asserted, but rather to disrupt the integrity of the political system and undermine Americas standing in the world more broadly. No mention was made of the Kremlinrun Englishlanguage propaganda outlet RT, which regularly pushes what can broadly be described as mostly leftwing antiAmerican and proRussian agitation. Also ignored were actual financial connections between Russianrelated interests and the Clintons or their inner circle. For months, Democrat politicians and operatives have colluded with their news media allies to push a narrative of Russias President Vladimir Putin directing the Russian state apparatus to provide political support to Donald Trump.

"Clemson University Students Welcome Ben Shapiro Is A Pig By Hank Berrien November 1, 2016 Apparently word has been passed to leftists that Daily Wire EditorIn Chief Ben Shapiro will be speaking at Clemson University tonight.

Shapiros usual denunciation of political correctness is likely the reason for the gratuitous insult in October 2015, Clemson was plagued by PC when a few students protested Clemson Dinings Maximum Mexican night, tweeting their displeasure with such a #CUlturallyInsensitive event. Clemson senior Austin Pendergist told Campus Reform the postevent uproar was ridiculous  This is something that Clemson Dining has done for years without any sort of backlash. People love the cultural nights in the dining halls. Whats next Are they going to take away all potato based food as to not offend students from Irish decent Remove the stir fry station so AsianAmerican students dont feel as if they are being misrepresented When does it end But the administration wound up apologizing for the event Dr. Doug Hallenbeck, Clemson Universitys Senior Associate Vice President of Student Affairs, said the event displayed a flattened cultural view of Mexican culture  It is the mission of University Housing  Dining to create supportive and challenging environments that enrich and nourish lives. We failed to live out our mission yesterday, and we sincerely apologize, adding that the university will continue to work closely with its food service provider to create dining programs that align with Clemson Universitys core values. The administration also apologized on the Clemson Dining Services Facebook and Twitter pages. Pendergist said the event had only featured a couple balloons, sombreros, and some tacos, adding, For as long as Ive been here, and probably for much longer, Clemson dining has put on certain culinary theme nights, where they decorate the dining halls and serve whatever kind of food. They have Italian night, Mexican night, seafood night, midnight breakfast, all kinds of events. ",bias

"WOW Indictment Likely in Clinton Foundation Case, Hillarys Server Hacked by FIVE Foreign Entities By November 3, 2016 Uhoh. According to Bret Baier of Fox News, the FBI has been investigating the Clinton Foundation for over a year, and that investigation has been deep and wide  and just as importantly, the FBI is on the verge of indictment for payforplay with regard to Hillarys State Department. The FBI investigation has uncovered laptops from Clinton top aides and the material on those laptops is being analyzed. And most importantly of all , the sources at the FBI have apparently told Baier with 99 percent accuracy that Hillarys server was hacked at least five foreign intelligence agencies, and information was withdrawn. Meanwhile, we now know that the Department of Justice attempted to pressure the FBI into shutting down the investigation into the Clinton Foundation entirely. According to The Wall Street Journal , the FBI deputy director even asked the DOJ if they truly wanted to shut down a validly predicated investigation. This is devastating information for Hillary. Donald Trump is now leading in Florida, Ohio, Nevada, Iowa, and North Carolina. Trump is within spitting distance in Colorado and Pennsylvania, and two new polls show Trump up in Virginia and New Hampshire, respectively. If Trump picks off any of those latter states, he wins the election. The best case scenario for Hillary Clinton just days ago was simple hunker down and wait out these scandals. Assume that as time goes on, the race will revert back to its preComey normal, with Hillary hovering between a two and four percent lead. But each new day brings a new revelation about her corruption and the corruption of the Clinton Foundation and State Department. Each new day demonstrates the extent of the coverup by the Obama administration. Hillarys running out of days to recover. The only question is whether she can hang on with her fingernails now, especially if the American public is upset enough about her payforplay and exposure of American classified material to put Trump in the White House, not trusting Loretta Lynchs DOJ to prosecute Hillary for her crimes.

"7 Things You Need To Know About Trump And Sex Slave Island By Amanda Prestigiacomo May 9, 2016 Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has thrown everything but the kitchen sink at Hillary Clinton when it comes to her husbands escapades. The kitchen sink, in this case, is Jeffery Epsteins Sex Slave Island and President Bill Clintons ties to it . Why wouldnt Trump use this ammo The answer is simple Trump himself has ties to Epstein, the billionaire Democratic donor and convicted pedophile known for having underage sex slaves on his private plane and what the media calls Sex Slave Island. Here are seven connections between Trump and Epsteins sex slave endeavors that you need to know about 1. Trump himself has said that Epstein is a lot of fun to be with, adding that he admired the sex offenders affinity for beautiful women on the younger side. Ive known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy, Trump once said about the convicted sex offender. Hes a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it  Jeffrey enjoys his social life. 2. Trump was named in Epsteins little black book. Epsteins  little black book  was stolen by a former employee in 2004. The book, nicknamed The Holy Grail by the employee, revealed the name of Donald Trump and listed 14 phone numbers including emergency numbers, car numbers, and numbers to Trumps security guard and houseman. 3. Trump has allegedly flown on Epsteins private plane  a hot spot for underage sex orgies. Mark Epstein, Jeffreys brother, testified in 2009 that Trump flew on Jeffreys private jet at least once, reports VICE News . Meanwhile, message pads see below from Epsteins Palm Beach mansion that were seized by investigators and obtained by VICE News indicate that Trump called Epstein twice in November of 2004. Epsteins private Boeing 727, according to one of his alleged victims, Virginia Roberts, was nicknamed the Lolita Express. Roberts recalled unsavoury sex orgies on the private plane when she was just 15 years of age with Epstein and his friends. 4. Both Trump and Epstein are named as sex abusers in a case with an underaged girl. Radar Online reports that a woman in California, identified as Katie Johnson, filed a 100 million lawsuit against Trump on April 26, accusing the real estate mogul of raping her when she was just 13 years old. Johnson claims Trump raped her when she was 13yearsold and forced her to engage in sex acts by threatening to harm her and her family, notes The Independent UK . She claims the alleged abuse took place over a fourmonth period at underage sex parties held in New York City in 1994. Epstein was also named for alleged sexual misconduct and threats. Trumps team adamantly denies the accusation, suspecting the claim is possibly a hoax since there is allegedly no evidence the plaintiff actually exists. 5. Epstein admitted to knowing Trump under oath, and curiously pled the fifth to Trump attending sex parties with underage girls. Back in 2010, Epstein admitted to socializing with Trump, but when a lawyer representing an underaged victim of Epsteins asked if he has ever socialized with Donald Trump in the presence of females under the age of 18, Epstein curiously pled the Fifth. Per Vice News  Q Have you ever had a personal relationship with Donald Trump A. What do you mean by personal relationship, sir Q. Have you socialized with him A. Yes, sir. Q. Yes A. Yes, sir. Q. Have you ever socialized with Donald Trump in the presence of females under the age of 18 A Though Id like to answer that question, at least today Im going to have to assert my Fifth, Sixth, and 14th Amendment rights, sir. 6. At least one of Epsteins underage sex victims was recruited from Trumps MaraLago  which he frequented often. Virginia Roberts, an alleged victim of Epsteins, was recruited to perform a massage for Epstein while working as a 9perhour locker room attendant at MarALago. Roberts claims that Epstein turned her into a sex slave and pimped her out to various friends, including Englands Prince Andrew. Over the years, the passengers on Epsteins jet, she said, included a whole bunch of other girls, sometimes famous people, sometimes some politicians. 7. Trump was subpoenaed in 2009 for his connection to Epsteins underage sex slave rings. Trump has denied ever being served. In 2009, Trump was subpoenaed in a case against Epstein concerning victim Virginia Roberts. Trumps attorney Alan Garten said that the subpoena never happened. There is no debate over what happened, said one of Roberts attorneys. I served Mr. Trump with a subpoena for deposition in 2009. He talked to me voluntarily, and consequently we withdrew the subpoena in light of his voluntarily providing information. I cant imagine there being any dispute of any of this. Additionally, Garten told VICE News in January that Mr. Trump has no relationship with Epstein other than the Democratic donor frequenting Trumps MarALago. A lot of people hung out there, including Jeffrey Epstein, said Garten. That is the only connection. According to the evidence, however, the connections with Epstein appear to go a lot deeper than that. Tags",bias
"Christie Lost Republicans The 2012 Election. He May Be Losing Them The 2016 Election, Too. By Ben Shapiro November 4, 2016 Ambition can be dangerous. Not just for the ambitious man or woman, but for the country  for all those who ally with the ambitious person. For the last eight years, one of the most ambitious men in politics has been New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Hailed as a conservative darling after taking on teachers unions in New Jersey  brash language about punching them in the face marked his rise as a political force and an upandcomer in presidential politics  Christie has nearly singlehandedly destroyed the Republican Party in two straight presidential elections. In 2012, Christie was considered and rejected for vice president by Mitt Romney  but then gave the keynote speech in primetime at the Republican convention. There, he spent the bulk of his time talking about his own wonders, ignoring Romney completely. Fox News Chris Wallace called the speech the most curious keynote speech I have ever heardFor a moment I forgot who was the nominee of the party. Then, the week before the election, Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast. While New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told President Obama that his presence was unnecessary, Christie invited Obama to New Jersey, then hugged him and took him on a tour of Atlantic City, where they made political love along the boardwalk underneath the cloudy skies. I cannot thank the president enough for his personal concern and compassion for our state, Christie said, adding that it was my honor to introduce President Obama. Christie was, at the time, facing down rumors that thenNewark Mayor Corey Booker, who is black, would run against him. As The New York Times noted, The scene played out on televisions around the country like a stirring campaign ad that hit themes of bipartisanship and crisis management  only it was run free of charge. Obama surged in the final days and beat Romney handily. Fast forward three years. Christie was running in the Republican primaries. Hed done nothing much in the polls his only hope was to somehow do well in New Hampshire. He had no support in states like South Carolina or Nevada, or southern states dominated by support for Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio. So, naturally, he used his presence at the debate before the New Hampshire primary  a state in which Rubio was surging following his Iowa showing  to destroy Rubio. Christie rightly labeled Rubio a robotic candidate, Rubio repeated himself, Christie hit him again  and Rubio fell apart in the polling. Trump ran away with the state. Almost immediately, Christie quit the race and fell in behind Trump. Thanks in large part to Christies help, Trump won the nomination. Now, with Trump surging in the polls the week before his general election against Hillary Clinton, Christie has struck again this time, two of his top aides have been found guilty on all charges related to Bridgegate, the scandal in which the Christie administration allegedly blocked bridges in order to punish a local Democrat who wouldnt endorse Christies reelection bid . This story will allow the media to shift its focus to the Trump campaign, since Christie is leader of Trumps White House transition team. In a tight election, it could be enough to hand Hillary the White House. So thanks, Chris Christie. The Democrats couldnt have done it without you. Tags",bias

"11 Stupid Things Vox.coms Matthew Yglesias Has Said By Aaron Bandler October 26, 2016 Matt Yglesias of Vox has always been a gold mine of comedy fodder, given his penchant for saying things that are mindbogglingly asinine. Apparently Yglesias agrees with this sentiment Matt Yglesias deleted something like 30,000 tweets yesterday. Clearly a man proud of his history of astute analysis and voxplanations. Fortunately, the Internet is forever and all of the stupid things that Yglesias has said can still be found and mocked mercilessly. Here are 11 things Yglesias has said that are incredibly dumb. 1. Yglesias was convinced that people would love Obamacare. That is, until he didnt . @mattyglesias Obamacare marker  which was solid as of 15 minutes ago  appears to no longer be markering pic.twitter.com/a0EyXImI8g  Omri Ceren @cerenomri October 26, 2016 His 2013 piece is still available though, and in it he whines about how supposedly the media, for nonideological reasons, is just massively biased toward negativity about this kind of thing. Yglesias also links to another piece of his in which he claimed that when Obamacare becomes the status quo, people will still be happy with the status quo quo and easy to frighten. In other words, Yglesias felt that the plebs would eventually succumb to his way of thinking. That all fell by the wayside when the Obama administration admitted that premiums were set to increase by an average of 25 percent. 2. Yglesias made a racist comment toward former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal R. In a 2013 tweet that is now deleted, Yglesias wrote, Is Bobby Jindals reputation for intelligence anything other than ethnic stereotyping Yglesias doubled down on his nasty comment when he received backlash, tweeting Oh, fun. Conservative twitter is in bogus outrage mode. Eventually, Yglesias backed down, tweeting For the record, now that I know more about Jindals life its clear that hes a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff. The irony of Yglesias saying this was not lost on Twitter Good thing you dont say dumb stuff. MT @mattyglesias Its clear that Jindals a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff.  jon gabriel @exjon June 18, 2013 3. Yglesias once ranted against dumb Jewish politicians. The leftist pundit wrote a ThinkProgress piece in 2009 that was seriously titled Dumb Jewish Politicians, in which Yglesias highlighted a passage from Jonathan Chait, who wrote in the New Republic that thenSen. Joe Lieberman ICT had to be stupid for not supporting the public option. I suspect that Lieberman is the beneficiary, or possibly the victim, of a cultural stereotype that Jews are smart and good with numbers, Chait wrote. Trust me, its not true. If Senator Smith from Idaho was angering Democrats by spewing uninformed platitudes, most liberals would deride him as an idiot. With Lieberman, we all suspect its part of a plan. I think he just has no idea what hes talking about and doesnt care to learn Yglesias agreed Ive long held a related theory about Eric Cantor. Anyways, this reminds me that at a meeting this morning I pitched the idea of trying to do health reform in a secret Christmas morning session that only Jewish Senators would attend. Theres a whole bunchBoxer, Cardin, Feingold, Feinstein, Franken, Kohl, Lautenberg, Levin, Lieberman, Sanders, Schumer, Specter, and Wyden. Its a very progressive bunch and Lieberman could easily be outvoted 4. Yglesias advocated for ending time zones. Seriously. In what was a typical example of Vox being a waste of space, Yglesias wrote a 2014 piece titled The case against time zones Theyre impractical  outdated. Yglesias pontificated Northern Idaho is connected via I90 to Spokane and Seattle to its west, but not to Boise to its south so the Couer dAlene area is on Pacific Time rather than Mountain Time. India has broken with the general scheme and adopted a halfhour staggered time zone so as to place the entire country on one time. Yet while these zigzags and 30minute zones destroy the pristine geometry of railroad time, they serve a very practical purpose. It is genuinely annoying to schedule meetings, calls, and other arrangements across time zones. The need to constantly specify which time zone youre talking about is a drag. Commuting across time zones would be more annoying still, which is why the suburbs of Chicago that are located in Indiana use Illinois Central Time rather than Indianapolis Eastern Time. But the ultimate solution to this problem is not a lot of ad hoc deviations. Its to shift the world to one giant time zone. Ygleasias then called for One time to rule them alla phrase that prompted J.R.R. Tolkien to weep in his graveand then wrote this doozy If the whole world used a single GMTbased time, schedules would still vary. In general most people would sleep when its dark out and work when its light out. So at 2300, most of London would be at home or in bed and most of Los Angeles would be at the office. But of course Londons bartenders would probably be at work while some shift workers in LA would be grabbing a nap. The difference from today is that if you were putting together a LondonLA conference call at 2100 thered be only one possible interpretation of the proposal. A flight that leaves New York at 1400 and lands in Paris at 2000 is a sixhour flight, with no need to keep track of time zones. If your appointment is in El Paso at 1130 you dont need to remember that its in a different time zone than the rest of Texas. Pejman Yousefzadeh explained just how stupid Yglesiass time zone piece was, writing at Ricochet  I grant you that there are times when confusion does take place, but seriously, who cares Is befuddlement regarding time zones really such a pressing issue that Matthew Yglesias has to take to writing an article demanding that we abolish them Dont the people at Vox have anything better to write about Apparently they dont. 5. Yglesias doesnt understand Floridas geography very well. Yglesias wrote a short blurb in The Atlantic in 2007, in which he began thinking aloud about the city of Miami. Id been interested to know what, if anything, is legally or practically preventing the city from just expanding further and further west if anyone happens to know, Yglesias said. People immediately pointed the obvious answer Miami couldnt do so because there was this thing called a swampmost of which is The Everglades National Parkcausing such development to be difficult to accomplish. Yes, yes, commenters I know its a freaking swamp but theres plenty of development on exswampland in Florida  hence all the canals and weirdlooking lakes, an exasperated Yglesias wrote in an update. Except that the land is not exswampland, its an actual swamp . Maybe Yglesias shouldnt write a blurb that involves him thinking aloud. 6. Yglesias thinks that lying is perfectly fine...if youre a politician. Yglesias found himself getting smacked around on Twitter after he advocated for highspeed rail advocates to provide an unrealistically optimistic projection about the number of riders that will use the boondoggle program to obtain funding from the government. For better or for worse, thats politics, Yglesias wrote at ThinkProgress . On Twitter, Yglesias attempted to justify it by writing Fighting dishonesty with dishonesty is sometimes the right thing for advocates to do, yes. And yet, Yglesias had the temerity to accuse journalist Eli Lake of being dishonest on Twitter. Yglesias must have realized how badly he put himself in a Catch22 when he told the Daily Caller to go f yourself when they tried to interview him about the Twitter incident. 7. Yglesias once hailed the Department of Veteran Affairs as a healthcare model the country should emulate. The Federalist s Sean Davis pointed to Yglesias writing in 2009 that the VA was producing the highest quality care in the country. Their turnaround points the way toward solving Americas healthcare crisis. Yglesias also tweeted at GOP chairman Reince Priebus in 2013, Will @Reince be explaining the evils of socialized medicine to veterans This tweet was also deleted, and for good reason, since the VA has caused 307,000 veteran deaths due to systemic problems with the agency. 8. Yglesias doesnt understand the purpose of the Senate. Yglesias wrote the following for ThinkProgress in 2009, per the Guardian  If you add together the two Republican Senators from Wyoming with the one from Alaska, one from South Dakota, one from New Hampshire, two from Maine, two from Idaho, two from Nebraska, one from Nevada, two from Utah, two from Kansas, two from Mississippi, one from Iowa, two from Oklahoma, two from Kentucky, one from Louisiana, two from South Carolina, and two from Alabama, the 28 of them collectively represent on a system in which you attribute half the population of a given state to a senator 11.98 percent of the American population. Meanwhile, Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein together represent 11.95 percent of the American population. Now of course Texas is also a big state though at 7.81 percent of the population its a lot smaller than California and there are small states like Vermont and North Dakota that have two Democratic Senators. So the point here isnt a narrowly partisan one, though the wacky apportionment of the Senate does have a partisan valence. The point is that this is an unfair and bizarre way to run things. If you consider that the mean state would contain two percent of the population, we have just 34 Senators representing the aboveaverage states even though they collectively contain 69.15 percent of the population. The other 66 Senators represent about 30 percent of the people. If the Iranians were to succeed in overthrowing their theocracy and set about to write a new constitution, nobody in their right mind would recommend this system to them. In three paragraphs of rambling, incoherent nonsense, Yglesias missed the fact that the purpose of having two senators representing each state was so states with smaller populations would be properly represented and not have their interests swallowed up by states with larger populations. 9. Yglesias doesnt understand Americas financial system. Yglesias showed his ignorance of the issue when he wrote in a 2013 Slate column that there were far far far too many banks in the country, as there were 6,891 at the time. Yglesias bloviated that all these small banks were somehow dangerous 1. They are poorly managed You know how the best and brightest of Wall Street royally screw up sometimes This doesnt get better when you drill down to the lessbright and notasgood guys. It gets worse. And since small banks finance themselves almost entirely with loans from FDICensured depositors, nobody is watching the store. In effect, the wellmanaged banks are being taxed to subsidize the poorly managed ones. The dubious decisionmaking doesnt get as complicated as what you see on Wall Streetits mostly just classic boomandbust procyclical commercial real estate loansbut it creates all the same problems. 2. They cant be regulated Since these banks are so small, they could be easily driven out of business by high regulatory compliance costs. So since American public policy is perversely committed to preserving them, small banks regularly get various kinds of carveouts from regulations. And once the carveouts exist, they create pressure for extension further up the food chain. Other times the compliance issues of small firms become a reason to simply not do tight regulation. 3. They cant compete If you want the JPMorgan Chases and Bank of Americas of the world to be held to account, you need both regulation and competition. But a bank serving a handful of rural counties or a single midsized city doesnt offer any real competition. Having a large share of Americas banking sector tied up in tiny firms only makes it easier for a handful of big boys to monopolize bigtime finance. Davis debunked Yglesiass argument, which was devoid of citations and falsely claimed that there havent been any new banks formed in recent years there were at least four in 2013. Yglesias arguments are so poorly reasoned and so poorly supported that it leads one to question whether his post was thoughtlessly regurgitated from anticommunity bank talking points promoted by the big banks You guys, the Wall Street banks that nearly destroyed America arent the problem. Small community banks where bankers actually know the borrowers are the real problem. Dont worry about the facts. Just go with it., Davis wrote in The Federalist . Im actually at a loss to come up with a more charitable explanation. 10. Yglesias thinks that black conservatives are a recent phenomenon. After reading a review of a Booker T. Washington biography, Yglesias started thinking about black conservative political tradition, prompting him to write in a 2009 ThinkProgress post, Its only extremely recently that the idea of an AfricanAmerican aligning himself,  la Clarence Thomas, with the mainstream conservative movement in America could be remotely possible. But even so, that didnt mean there was no ideological conflict in black politics or that general rightist sentiments somehow didnt exist. This is patently false, as Damon Root explained in Reason  Actually, the great Harlem Renaissance author and journalist George Schuylerwho was known as the black H.L. Menckenpublished general rightist sentiments long before Clarence Thomas came on the scene, including Schuylers unambiguously titled 1966 autobiography Black and Conservative. And the celebrated novelist and folklorist Zora Neale Hurston both endorsed conservative Sen. Robert A. Taft in the 1952 presidential election and repeatedly attacked FDRs New Deal... 11. Yglesias expressed joy when Andrew Breitbart died. Following Breitbarts death, Yglesias tweeted  Conventions around dead people are ridiculous. The world outlook is slightly improved with @AndrewBrietbart sic dead. This tweet has also been deleted, and for good reasoncelebrating the death of someone just because of political differences is worse than stupid, its ghoulish, vile and reprehensible. And Slate defended Yglesias, stating that he is a very passionate journalist and Slate values that passion. Apparently Slate believes that passion trumps basic human decency and a reasonable IQ level, and Yglesias certainly does not possess the latter two qualities. ",bias

"Video Women On The Street Explain Why They Hate Hillary By Chase Stephens November 8, 2016 Media analyst and YouTuber Mark Dice took to the streets once again to ask the public what they think of this years presidential election, specifically, what they think about ol Crooked Hillary. In the video below, titled Why Women Hate Hillary Clinton, Dice gives women the opportunity to voice their concerns about the character and integrity of the former Secretary of State, and the results are brutally honest. Whats wrong with Hillary Why do everybody hate her, Dice asks the first woman who replies, Because shes a criminal. Shes a liar and I hate her voice, another woman tells him, adding, Her voice drives me crazy. A few more ladies tell Mark that Hillary is a liar, shes terrible, with one woman adding, She lost to Obama eight years ago so why is she still running. Its kind of absurd to me. The women also had problems with Hillarys constant scandals, dirty money, bad policies, and her relentlessly playing the gender card. I just believe in more personal freedom and less government control, one jogger told the host, while another summed it up with, Its time for a change, Hillarys out of here. Exit thought from Dice Hillary Clinton is not a woman. It is a demon. Stop saying first female this, and first female that. Demons have no gender.  Mark Dice @MarkDice August 31, 2016 ",bias

"The Media Lost All of Its Political Power Last Night  Thank You, Donald Trump By John Nolte November 9, 2016 The morally dark Obamaera is over and utterly and totally repudiated. The Clintons have finally and forever been staked in their mercenary black hearts. Our smug, supremacist overlords in the Elite Establishment of both Parties, these rotting, rentseeking parasites, are now vanquished. But nothing is grander, nothing is more glorious, nothing is more satisfying, nothing is sweeter, nothing is more validating, nothing is better for America than the death of the mainstream medias political power. The elite national political media is done as a force, moral or otherwise, in this country. Done. Buried. Exposed. Over. Out. And using a slowacting poison called hubris, it was death by suicide. So smug. So sure of themselves. So sanctimonious. So snarkfilled. So utterly incapable of anything close to selfreflection. The selfinduced poison took effect over a number of years and through five steps. Here they are. 1. Pimping for ObamaCare The national political media didnt just cheerlead for ObamaCare, they LIED to us. Willfully and with malicious intent, they all lied to us. The outlawing of almost every existing insurance plan was right there in the bill, right there in black and white. But the media didnt care. They wanted to give their Precious Obama a win and in order to do that, they jumped on board the You Can Keep Your Insurance propaganda express. Worse, those of us who did tell the truth were branded as liars and racists, not only by the pundits but by those godforsaken factcheckers. Then Utopia met reality. Then the lies were exposed. And the result is that up to and including last night, at both the local and national level, ObamaCare has decimated the Democrat Party. But nowhere near as bad as it has decimated the middle class. The medias role in this is unforgivable and destroyed whatever remained of their moral authority. From here on, they could only get more sweaty, desperate, and dangerous. 2. Casting off Every Journalistic Ethic to Destroy Trump Openly, proudly, and belligerently, in order to hijack a presidential election, we were treated to the Pompous Announcement that Trump was such a threat to humanity, it was now time for journalists throughout the land to cast off every standard that makes journalism journalism, starting with objectivity. Even former good guys like CNNs Jake Tapper morphed into an unrecognizable LyingSnarkVirtueSignalingMachines  another rotting cog in the Narrative Wheel, a mindless member of a selfdeluded, governmentworshiping cult that wouldnt piss on Middle America if we were on fire. Professional sobriety was cast off because this one was in the bag, baby And who could miss the historic opportunity to selfrighteously pointandlaugh at the hideous rubes as they were finally and forever being buried alive under a Brave New World. 3. Grind Donald Trump To Dust While there is no question Trump deserved a few of the kitchen sinks hurled his way, never in my 50 years have I seen such a coordinated, desperate, dishonest, and poisonous campaign to disqualify a human being through the dark art of stripping him and his supporters of all their humanity. 4. Embracing Confirmation Bias The longer the general election rolled on, the smaller the bubble of selfdelusion became. Inconvenient polls were sneered at and Voxsplained away. Exit polls could only means ONE thing, even though it was pretty clear they might mean another. My personal favorite was the late editorials where, based on no counted votes whatsoever, we were trolled with the news that it was Hillary, not Trump, who would emerge victorious with the hidden vote Oh, the delicious irony of that. Oh, how lovely it would be to rub that in the rubes faces on Election Night. By the time the votes were actually being counted, I was about 60 sure Hillary would win. The New York Times, however, was 92 sure. ABCNBCCBSAPBSNPRCNNWashingtonPostPolitico were 100 sure. But even I understood that state and local polls were more erratic than ever, that Hillary did seem legitimately freaked about the upper Midwest, that the best pollster in the country had Trump up 2, that Trump never lost his fervent base, that the right track/wrong track numbers had been upside down for a decade, that there was still a largerthanusual number of undecideds, that this thing that was Real might not be enough to win, but it was still Real. No, no, we were told, its all smoke and mirrors, all goldleafed Trump Steaks. Look at Obamas approval ratings Look at the Hispanic vote Look at this squirrel and that squirrel and the other squirrel over there. Sit down, son, dont you understand that Im a data machine Its science, rube. Dont you Vox, racist And then the worst thing imaginable happened. 5. The Media Lost the Election The hate, the lies, the removal of the mask of objectivity, the pushing of every single chip into the middle of the table  that can actually work  IF YOU WIN. But the media didnt win. In the most spectacular fashion, with their pants down and their bare ass hanging out for the world to see, they lost. And with that loss went EVERYTHING. And now the media is exposed in front of the whole world as a Swaggering Potemkin Bully that no longer has the power to sway public opinion, even when they throw absolutely everything they have at one man, and do so with much of the Republican Party on their side. Not only has the media forever been exposed as brazenly dishonest and laughably out of touch, worse than all that, they are exposed as WEAK, a force no one need ever fear or kowtow to again. Without that sheen of fear, without that threat of intimidation, like a vanquished bully, so goes all their power. F you, mainstream media.  The delicious irony of all this is that the last desperate gasp of the political media did actually prove their precious Barack Obama correct about one thing The moral arc of history does indeed bend towards justice.

"Video Trump Voter Dragged from His Car, Brutally Beaten, and Robbed by Gang of Hillary Supporters By Chase Stephens November 10, 2016 A YouTube video thats making the rounds appears to show a man being beaten and robbed in the middle of the street by a group laughing and shouting that he voted for Trump. In the clip below, what appears to be a middleaged white man is on the ground while two younger black males are hitting and kicking him in the head. The camera person yells, Happens when you vote Trump, dummy, while a woman next to him shouts, You voted Trump You voted Trump Damn Yeah, he voted Trump Damn The man continues to struggle against his two attackers until he gets up and sees that a woman, presumably associated with the attackers, is going through the his car looking for valuables. Get out of my car, the man yells as he approaches the women, who shouts back, Youre gonna pay for my shit One of the attackers returns and starts punching the man from behind in the back of the head and then continues swinging as the man turns around. The camera man and his companion continue their color commentary by laughing and yelling, Beat his ass Dont vote Trump Dont vote Trump The video ends with the group acknowledging that they should leave before the police arrive. In the longer version of the video below posted on Twitter, one of the attackers gets into the drivers seat and closes the door. The beaten Trump supporter stands at the car window, presumably telling the thief to get out, as the woman starts to punch him in the back of the head and is joined by the second attacker.

"Poll Sexism Was NOT A Factor In Hillarys Loss By Aaron Bandler November 11, 2016 Some leftists still reeling from Hillary Clintons stunning defeat on Tuesday are blaming her defeat on supposed sexism against a woman president. However, a new poll suggests that sexism did not play a role at all in Clintons loss. The poll, conducted by Conquest Communications Group and published on Just Facts , featured a question specifically geared toward gauging potential sexism If you were faced with a choice between a male and a female presidential candidate, who would you vote for Here were the results emphasis added Overall, 69 of voters said It does not matter, 15 preferred a female, 12 preferred a male, 3 were unsure, and 1 refused to answer. Male voters and Trump voters were more likely than any other groups to say It does not matter, at 73 and 72 respectively. The other groups were not far behind and within the margins of error, with rates of 67 for Clinton voters. 66 for undecided voters. 64 for females. Naturally, supporters of Trump were more likely to support a male president than a female president25 percent to 2 percent, respectivelyand Clinton supporters were more likely to support female president than a male president, 27 percent to 5 percent, respectively. The survey was conducted from October 1123, so it was taken a couple of weeks before the election. But its hard to imagine a majority of voters all of a sudden turned into a bunch of sexists. There is a little bias towards a male president among Trump voters and a little bias towards a female president among Clinton voters, but the results of the survey suggest that overall, the genitalia of a candidate is not a significant factor involved in most voters when it comes to choosing the next president of the United States. Democrats will have to find a different strategy for identity politics since the gender card doesnt work. Speaking of identity politics, it looks like the race card seems to be in trouble as well .

"Aaron Bandler November 11, 2016 Presidentelect Donald Trump. That is still a term that is surreal to a lot of people, as he was not expected to win on Tuesday. What were the driving factors that propelled Trump to the presidency How was he able to pull off such a stunning upset Here are seven reasons why Trump won. 1. Hillary Clinton was unable to get the minority vote to turn out for her. Last night, Dems were calling the race a Whitelash  wrong. Mitt won 59 of white vote, Trump won 58. Minority voters didnt turn out.  David French @DavidAFrench November 9, 2016 In fact, Trump was able to get a larger share of the minority vote than Mitt Romney did in 2012, as the Daily Wire has explained  Unsurprisingly, Trump lost to Clinton in the Latino and black votes by margins of 88 percent to 8 percent and 65 percent and 29 percent, respectively. Surprisingly, this was better than Romney fared among the aforementioned demographics in 2012, as he lost both groups by margins of 93 percent to 7 percent and 71 percent to 27 percent, respectively Michael Barone has noted that turnout fell in heavily black Philadelphia, Cleveland, Detroit, and Milwaukee. Millennial generation turnout was tepid, and Trump carried white Millennials by 5 points. The enthusiasm was just not there for Clinton. 2. Trump was able to pull in former Obama voters. According to the Washington Post , Trump was able to win over onethird of the 700 counties that went for Obama twice. Clinton was only able to win six of the 2,200 counties that didnt go for Obama. Trump was better at obtaining crossover voters than Clinton was. So who are these former Obama voters who voted for Trump in 2016, and what caused them to switch 3. These former Obama voters felt that Trump cared about them, and the Democrat Party did not. John Daniel Davidson explains in The Federalist that Clinton and the Democrat Party took the bluecollar, working class whites in the Rust Belt for grantedexemplified by Clintons pledge to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of businessand it was to their detriment. The Rust Belt has been in economic decline for years, but it has suffered greatly from the Obama administrations regulations towards coal. While the Democrats wrote off the Rust Belt, Trump actually acknowledged their struggles, and that was all it took. Trump was the first national political figure in generations who saw them, acknowledged that they have been left behind, that their cities and towns are in a state of persistent decline, and promised to help out somehow, writes Davidson. When youre used to being dismissed as bitter folks who cling to guns and religion, as President Obama did in 2008, or denounced as deplorables and irredeemable, as Hillary Clinton did during this election, respect goes a long wayeven if there are no easy solutions, from Washington or anywhere else, to the problems that plague your town. 4. The FBI reopening its investigation into Hillarys emails helped Trump. Per RedState , author Ed Klein said on the Steve Malzberg Show that Clinton was sobbing inconsolably on election night and was blaming FBI director James Comey reopening the investigation as well as Obama for not stopping the investigation as to why she lost. Theres no question that the reopening of the investigation did considerably help Trump, as the polls severely tightened after the announcement. Poll numbers showed that the vast majority of Americans felt that Hillary was acting in an immoral manner. The spotlight was off of Trumps vulgar comments towards women and his sexual assault accusers, and instead the focus was on Clintons private email server. But Clinton is leaving out one major person who is responsible for her loss... 5. Hillary was a terrible candidate. If Clinton had been elected president, she would have been the first elected president to have been the subject of numerous FBI investigations. She broke the law by using her private email server to conduct official State Department business and there was a lot of quid pro quo that occurred at the Clinton Foundation . Clinton is robotic and devoid of charisma with a record in politics that is short of accomplishments but rich in failure, sleaze, and corruption. Basically, Clinton is an Obama Democrat without Obamas charm, according to Jonah Goldberg . She may have been the only Democratic candidate that could lose to Trump, and the Democrats wanted to coronate her from the beginning. They have no one to blame but themselves for President Trump. 6. The public no longer has any faith in the mediaand that includes latenight comics. Will Rahn wrote at CBS News that the unbearable smugness of the Clintonbiased media was offputting to a lot of voters, as they sneered at Trump supporters as stupid backward hicks while doing everything they could to prop up Clinton. Trumps vitriol toward the press ended up benefiting him politically. Poll numbers reflect this, as trust in the media has declined over the years. Rahn explains Journalists increasingly dont even believe in the possibility of reasoned disagreement, and as such ascribe cynical motives to those who think about things a different way. We see this in the ongoing veneration of facts, the ones peddled by explainer websites and data journalists who believe themselves to be curiously postideological. That the explainers and data journalists so frequently get things hilariously wrong never invites the soulsearching youd think it would. Instead, it all just somehow leads us to more smugness, more meanness, more certainty from the reporters and pundits. Faced with defeat, we retreat further into our bubble, assumptions left unchecked. No, its the voters who are wrong. As a direct result, we get it wrong with greater frequency. Out on the road, we forget to ask the right questions. We cant even imagine the right question. We go into assignments too certain that what we find will serve to justify our biases. The publics estimation of the press declines even further  fewer than oneinthree Americans trust the press, per Gallup  which starts the cycle anew. The same applies to latenight comics. Mollie Hemingway writes in The Federalist that Jon Stewart is partly responsible for the election of Trump because of how he singlehandedly destroyed CNNs Crossfire, resulting in a new age of hyperpolitical, hyperliberal latenight comedy. Stewarts The Daily Show spawned Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, Trevor Noah and several other lefty comics that perverted comedy into smarmy leftwing political lectures talking down to conservatives. Jon Stewart is known for brutally deriding a show that featured people of differing views civilly discussing issues of the day, writes Hemingway. He got that show killed and significantly strengthened the world where cultural elites engaged in groupthink mockery of those with whom they disagree. The results include a further erosion of civility, a decrease in Americans ability to understand each other and their concerns, and, of all things, Presidentelect Donald Trump. Which all culminates into the main reason why Trump was elected... 7. Americans are tired of being trashed by leftist elites. Ben Shapiro explains  Trump won because many Americans were sick of being told that they were the racists as Barack Obama and his Department of Justice stoked race riots in major cities around the country. Trump won because many Americans were sick of watching other Americans being destroyed for their supposed intolerance  for their religious beliefs, for their unwillingness to label women men and men women, for their support for traditional marriage or conservative political candidates. Trump won because many Americans were tired of the medias constant harping on Americas flaws  we were supposedly sexist, racist, and homophobic. Americans said that they did not believe the media, and they were right to do so. In other words, the left has been tearing down America as a country infested with intolerant, prejudicial bigots who are incapable of thinking for themselves and needed to rely on them on how to live their lives. The people finally had had enough, so they elected the man whom they felt best stuck it to the leftist elites. Tags ",bias
"This Is The Best Picture In Human History By November 10, 2016 This is the best picture in human history. It is the best picture in human history because it tells the entire tale of both parties, the republic, and why we are where we are. On the left side of this picture, we have Donald Trump  a reality television star and lifelong vulgarian, the new presidentelect of the United States. He points his fingers and smiles that Apprentice smile as he makes a point. On the right side of this picture, we have Barack Obama  a man who considered himself a paragon of dignity and rectitude, who thought of himself as a transformative figure and an intellectual giant. He sits next to the man who maintained for years that his birth certificate was a fraud, the man who has the opportunity to undo virtually his entire agenda within the first month of his assumption of office. And Obama, rightly, looks like a man with a pole shoved so far up his rectum that the glint of steel is visible behind his eyes. Behind Obama sits a bust of Abraham Lincoln, his eyes downcast, mourning for his country. Yep. Greatest picture ever. This is a picture of justice done and karma ascendant. Barack Obamas image of himself is not accurate  to Americans, Obama is a reality TV show star. He transformed the presidency from a dignified office into a selfiestick, celebrityridden sinkhole of Hollywood glitterati, hobnobbing with Glozell and Macklemore, cracking wise about the presidency with Jimmy Kimmel before saying that a reality star like Trump could never be president. This picture looks like the chickens coming home to roost, as Obamas former pastor might put it. And then theres Lincoln. Lincoln, who gave his life and spent his presidency building the groundwork for racial toleration, mourning behind Barack Obama, who has spent his presidency polarizing for electoral gain. Lincoln, who represented wisdom, mourning behind a clown as the clown gestures to the assembled crowd. Given Republicans domination of the Senate and the Congress, I have hopes for Trumps presidency  I hope he keeps his promises and that he becomes a better man and a wonderful president, and believe he has every obligation to fulfill his conservative campaign promises  but Trump occupying Lincolns office is, at best, a jarring visual. Thats the picture. ",bias

"Frank Camp November 13, 2016 During an interview with Lesley Stahl for 60 Minutes , which will air in its entirety Sunday night, Donald Trump began to walk back his campaign promise regarding the deportation of illegal immigrants We are getting them out of our country, the president elect said about the several million illegal immigrants with serious criminal records. After the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, were going to make a determination on the people youre talking about who are terrific people, theyre terrific people who were going to make a determination on, but before we make a determination, we want to secure our border. Gasp. Donald Trump rose to political fame on the back of his strong stance on illegal immigration. Throughout the primary process, he promised a  deportation force , telling MSNBCs Mika Brzezinski in November 2015 Youre going to have a deportation force, and youre going to do it humanely. Dont forget, Mika, that you have millions of people that are waiting in line to come into this country and theyre waiting to come in legally. And I always say the wall, were going to build the wall. Its going to be a real deal. Its going to be a real wall. In August, Trump delivered a major immigration speech in Phoenix, Arizona, in which he softened his stance a bit, focusing on illegal immigrants who have committed serious crimes Within ICE, I am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice. He then added that anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have laws and to have a country. Otherwise we dont have a country. During the final presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, Trump reiterated his position against amnesty Well, first of all, Clinton wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years. We need strong borders. For Trump diehards, these statements were enough. Their guy was going to deport 11 million illegal immigrants, and no one would tell them otherwise. However, as anyone with access to Google should know, the president elect has long supported amnesty in some fashion. In July 2015, Donald Trump told CNNs Dana Bash I would get people out and then have an expedited way of getting them back into the country so they can be legalA lot of these people are helping usand sometimes its jobs a citizen of the United States doesnt want to do. I want to move em out, and were going to move em back in and let them be legal. What Trump was talking about is known as touchback amnesty. Such a plan would indeed involve the deportation of illegal immigrants, but allow them an expedited means of returning to the United States in order to obtain legal status. In other words, they touch base in their home country, then come right back. In November 2015, Eric Trump repeated his fathers plan during an interview with Fox News Megyn Kelly The point isnt just deporting them, its deporting them and letting them back in legally. Hes been so clear about that and I know the liberal media wants to misconstrue it, but its deporting them and letting them back legally. Going back further, Trumps support for amnesty is even more stark. Speaking on Fox  Friends in 2012, he said For people that have been here for years that have been hardworkers, have good jobs, theyre supporting their familyits very, very tough to just say By the way, 22 years, you have to leave. Get outIm one of the worlds very conservative people, but I have to tell you on a human basis, how do you throw somebody out thats lived in this country for twenty years During the 2012 presidential election cycle, Trump even called Mitt Romneys idea of selfdeportation  maniacal , and remarked that Republican Party policy toward illegal immigrants was  meanspirited . Donald Trump is a man who will say whatever he needs to in order to win. Now that he has won, hes already backtracking on multiple campaign promises, from the repeal of the Affordable Care Act ACA to the deportation of illegal immigrants. Tags ",bias
"3 Thoughts On Steve Bannon As White House Chief Strategist By Ben Shapiro November 14, 2016 So, in a notunexpected move, Donald Trump has elevated former Breitbart News CEO Steve Bannon to chief strategist of the White House. When I left Breitbart back in March, I accused Bannon of turning Breitbart News into Trump Pravda  as I wrote, Indeed, Breitbart News, under the chairmanship of Steve Bannon, has put a stake through the heart of Andrews legacy. In my opinion, Steve Bannon is a bully, and has sold out Andrews mission in order to back another bully, Donald Trump he has shaped the company into Trumps personal Pravda, to the extent that he abandoned and undercut his own reporter. That decision paid off for Bannon  in August, he became Trumps campaign CEO. At that point, I wrote this piece describing who Bannon was , and this one for The Washington Post describing his probable impact on the campaign . With Bannons accession to a top White House role, its time to answer some brief questions about the man and what hes likely to do. Is Bannon AntiSemitic And Racist I have no evidence that Bannons a racist or that hes an antiSemite the Huffington Posts blaring headline WHITE NATIONALIST IN THE WHITE HOUSE is overstated, at the very least. With that said, as I wrote at The Washington Post in August, Bannon has openly embraced the racist and antiSemitic altright  he called his Breitbart  the platform of the altright . Milo Yiannopoulos, the star writer at the site, is an altright popularizer , even as he continuously declares with a wink that hes not a member. The lefts opposition to Trump, and their attempts to declare all Trump support the altright have obfuscated what the movement is. The movement isnt all Trump supporters. Its not conservatives unsatisfied with Paul Ryan, nor is it people angry at the media. Bannon knows that. Hes a smart man, not an ignorant one. The altright, in a nutshell, believes that Western culture is inseparable from European ethnicity . I have no evidence Bannon believes that personally. But hes happy to pander to those people and make common cause with them in order to transform conservatism into European farright nationalist populism. That means that the altright will cheer Bannon along as he marbles Trumps speeches with talk of globalism  and that Bannon wont be pushing Trump to dump the racists and antiSemites who support Trump anytime soon. After all, they love Bannon  actual white supremacists like Peter Brimelow called his August appointment great news, and Richard Spencer explained, Breitbart has elective affinities with the Alt Right, and the Alt Right has clearly influenced Breitbart. In this way, Breitbart has acted as a gateway to Alt Right ideas and writers. I dont think it has done this deliberately again, its a matter of elective affinities. That doesnt mean Bannon will push racist or antiSemitic policy, or that hell be antiIsrael himself  unless it serves his interests. What Does Bannons Accession Mean Bannon has goals. One of those goals is maximization of personal power, which is why he spent the last decade and a half glomming onto powerful rightwing personalities Bachmann, Morris, Palin, kissing their asses, and then moving on up the chain. With Breitbart and Trump, he picked two winners in a row  and that means hes now at the pinnacle of American power. So, what will he do with that power Hell target enemies. Bannon is one of the most vicious people in politics, which is why Ive been joking for months that should Trump win, Id be expecting my IRS audit any moment. That wasnt completely a joke. He likes to destroy people. But more importantly, Bannons interested in turning the Republican Party into a farright European party. Because Republicans will like some of the policy that comes with that, it could happen. Heres what I wrote in March about the Trump movement  Trump is a Europeanstyle response to the Europeanstyle leftism of Barack Obama. Hes a soft Europeanstyle populist, from his interventionist economics to his closedborders foreign policy. As I wrote in December, Compare Trumps platform with that of Marine Le Pen, whose French National Front poses a significant threat to the national political establishment. She calls for harsher penalties for criminals, significant restrictions on Muslim immigration to France, protectionism on trade, a restoration of the Franc as the national currency rather than the Euro, and big government in terms of health care. This sounds a lot like Trump. But the European right is not the American right. The American right believes in Constitutional ideas about checks and balances and federalism and negative rights from government. The European right doesnt believe any of these things. Should Trump win, we could watch American conservatism lose the only party it has ever had. Thats the plan. Yesterday, The Daily Beast reported that Bannon reached out to Le Pen for global ultraright coalition. Over the weekend Le Pen met with Nigel Farage of the UK Independent Party. And Trump met with Farage shortly after being elected. Bannon has always wanted to burn down the GOP. Thats still his goal. He wants it replaced with an American National Front party in fact if not in name. Which War Will Bannon Lead Bannon considers himself a wartime consigliore  always at war. Always. So the only question left is this what will Bannons actual role be Its difficult to tell, since Trump announced the Bannon hire at the same time he announced that former RNC chairman Reince Priebus as his chief of staff. What will their relationship be like Ed Morrissey of HotAir thinks that Bannon will lead the antimedia fight, and Reince will coordinate with Congress. That would be the best possible scenario. Others have speculated that Bannon has been added to the team as a sop to the populist base, which would be angry at Trump hopping into bed with the most establishmenty fellow in Washington. That, too, would be fine. Its hard to tell from the outside whats happening, but heres a third theory Reince is the bagman for Trump, and Bannons whispering in Trumps ear. That would fit the fact pattern here, given Reinces outsized praise for Bannon this morning wise and smartvery, very smart, very temperate. Bannon is anything but temperate to those who disagree. Hes a consummate bully to anyone who disagrees hes actually malevolent. Priebus may not have seen a lot of disagreement because hes the one catering to Bannons agenda. If Bannons leading and Reince is following, that bodes ill for the Republican agenda. Bannon opposes the Republican Party, hates Paul Ryan  minutes after the joint Bannon/Priebus announcement, Breitbart News approvingly tweeted about a Congressional rebellion against Speaker Ryan  and wants to watch it all burn. Bannon loves the firefight. The only question is which direction hell turn his fire. Tags",bias

"Shapiro Eviscerates Raucous Protesters At University Of Wisconsin By Hank Berrien November 16, 2016 Daily Wire EditorinChief Ben Shapiro spoke at the University of WisconsinMadison on Wednesday night, and amid raucous leftist protesters who consistently tried to interrupt him and even blocked him from being seen by the audience by creating a human wall in front of him, found a way to respond with hilarious repartee that left the audience howling and the protesters eventually filing meekly out of the auditorium. After the ovation he received on entering, Shapiro quipped, Hey look at this. A campus that doesnt actually try to arrest me when I come. He continued, Before I begin, I did come bearing gifts for the social justice warriors in this room. I hear youve started wearing these safety pins around because you want to show your fellow college students how youre not one of these awful, terrible Trump people, that youre sensitive, and that you want to signal your virtue, so Ive brought along these safety pins, holding up safety pins and I also brought you something to wear them with  this diaper. Shapiro then held up a diaper, prompting huge laughs from the audience. When a protester yelled at Shapiro that he should be wearing a swastika, Shapiro held out his yarmulke, then fired back, In case you hadnt noticed, the folks with the swastikas arent too nice to my type. Shapiro continued, Stop being selfindulgent children stop pretending that everybody who voted for Trump is a vicious racist its your right to protest, of course, but you just make yourself look like an idiot when you cry over a dulyheld election  Donald Trump doesnt care about your protest. Donald Trump is sitting somewhere in Trump Tower eating a steak and bathing in your salty, salty tears. Referring to the attempt by leftists to prevent people who werent university students from attending Shapiros lecture, Shapiro opined I hear that a lot of folks at this publiclyfunded university want this campus to become a sanctuary campus for illegal immigrants. I do have a quick question if this campus can be a sanctuary for people in the country illegally, why are so many people trying to ban American citizens from this community from coming to this lecture And by the way, Im aware of this private Facebook page titled F White Supremacy Interrupting Ben Shapiro. With all due respect, F you right back, gang. After the applause subsided and Shapiro joked about how both Black Lives Mater and the KKK target him, the real fun began. Protesters stood up, chanting, Shame over and over again. Shapiro quipped, Wow, its like Game of Thrones . Should I get undressed and walk down the aisle The bulk of the crowd started booing the protesters. Shapiro addressed the protesters, saying, Im happy to talk with you, but they responded by screaming safety over and over. Shapiro joked, Did somebody fart The crowd responded to the protesters by chanting, USA. Shapiro replied, I tell you try not to be children the first thing you do is start screaming like my twoyearold. He added, You see, this is how conservatives actually treat people you stand up and you interrupt and you shout Safety, and youre perfectly safe. Look at that. Its amazing. That provoked sustained applause. When the protesters started screaming Shame again, Shapiro eviscerated them, pointing out, If youre going to pick a chant like Shame, watch Game of Thrones first. The bad guys shout Shame. The audience loved that line. On a roll, Shapiro continued, Youre not changing anybodys mind, All youre showing everybody is that your collective IQ, if it were channeled into electricity, night be able to toast a piece of bread lightly. He continued, Okay, can we talk now, or are you going to keep shouting Nows your chance to get it out. Lets hear your feelings. Cmon. Just go for it. Or is it going to be like every thirty seconds like an annoying microwave timer When the protesters resumed chanting, Shapiro responded, If you guys want to talk, we can talk, If you want to shout, get the hell out. More applause. Shapiro fired, For Gods sake, at least wait until I say something that offends you before getting offended. Shapiro returned to deconstructing the term social justice. When the protesters started again, a woman who runs a soup kitchen stood up, and admonished the protesters that she had driven for ten hours that day, and that they should shut freaking up and listen to the man speak. That prompted a standing ovation from the crowd and Shapiro. too. He added, See, thats what a decent, hardworking person sounds like as opposed to a loser student here on the public dime, presumably. Shapiro returned to his speech Racial diversity doesnt mean anything decency means everything  Diversity isnt our strength decency is our strength. He turned to the protesters Remember that Decency. The protesters screamed back, Shame Shapiro fired back, Decency The protesters chanted Shame but the crowd soon joined Shapiro in chanting Decency, shutting the protesters up. As Shapiro spoke of the falsity of white privilege, the protesters formed a line in front of Shapiro, prompting him to quip, If you guys are all going to come up here, can we all just have circle time or something The protesters chanted Safety for a minute and a half, but then the crowd started yelling back, Free speech matters. Shapiro turned to the blackboard behind him and wrote in capital letters, MORONS That again prompted cheering. One member of the audience yelled to the protesters, At least tell us what you want, or otherwise, just get out That brought a sustained ovation. After one protester tried to deliver a whiny monologue, the protesters started shouting Safety again, then filed out, yelling F white supremacy while flipping off Shapiro and the entire audience. That prompted the crowd to sing, Nananana, nananana, hey, hey, goodbye. It also promoted this from Shapiro Even after leaving the lecture hall, protestors continued to pound on the door. After Shapiro explained why the protesters had not been arrested, as the university stated that it gave the protesters time to protest at the front of the stage, or otherwise it would have to shut down the entire event, he continued, All I can wonder is if the administration would allow the same sort of privilege for any sort of conservative who decided to do this at a leftist event. Even after leaving the lecture hall, protestors continued to pound on the door, prompting Shapiro to quip, Doesnt this school give homework Does anybody have a job around here I guess when youre majoring in gender and diversity studies you have a lot of time on your hands. Shapiro noted that he had engaged in a backandforth with one of the protesters, who accused him of being a white supremacist. When he asked her why she thought so, she replied that she got that impression from his image. He fired back, Really Was it the yarmulke that did it for you He took another shot at the protesters during the speech, noting that people were born unequal, and adding, Some people us are born rich some of us are born poor some of us are born smart some of us are born protesters. The rest of the speech was vintage Shapiro, as was the QA afterward. Even the chalk was impressive Went back to the lecture hall and grabbed the EXACT piece of chalk @benshapiro used to write MORONS #FactsNotFeelings #onlyatYAF pic.twitter.com/W0Ch06SaGR  Japheth Patterson @japhood November 17, 2016 Video of entire event below ",bias
"Gallup Americans More Confident In Trump Since Election By Robert Kraychik November 16, 2016 A Gallup poll published on Wednesday indicates that 51 of Americans are more confident in Donald Trumps ability to serve as president following last weeks presidential election. 40, conversely, are less confident. Partisanship was strongly correlated with the polls respondents responses 95 of Trump voters said they were more confident in presidential capacity after the election, with 75 of Clinton voters saying they were now less confident. The same question was put to Americans by Gallup following the 1992 and 2000 presidential elections. Five weeks after the 1992 election, 84 of Bill Clinton voters said they were more confident in his presidential capability as opposed to 23 of George H. Bush voters and 37 of Ross Perot voters. In 2000, 85 of George W. Bush voters were more confident in his ability to be president as opposed to 29 of Al Gore voters. H/T Kaitlyn Scallhorn at The Blaze ",bias
"5 Things You Need to Know About Sanctuary Cities By Aaron Bandler November 16, 2016 With Donald Trump elected to the presidency, one of the policies that will likely come under fire is sanctuary cities, cities with policies that make them safe havens for illegal aliens. The issue became frontandcenter during the early portion of the Republican primary when Trump decried the murder of Kate Steinle by an illegal alien in San Francisco, a sanctuary city. In response to the election of Trump, leftist city leaders are digging in, officials in Los Angeles, Chicago and Boston signaling that they will not cooperate with the federal governments deportation efforts. Here are five things you need to know about sanctuary cities. 1. Sanctuary cities are a blatant violation of federal law. Some on the left have tried to claim that theyre perfectly legal, but this is clearly false. As James Walsh , former associate general counsel of Immigration and Naturalization Services, explains, 8 USC section 1324 deals with those persons who knowingly conceal, harbor, or shield undocumented aliens and could apply to officials in sanctuary cities and states. The fact that leftists are digging their heels in on sanctuary cities means theyre supporting a form of nullification, an irony not missed by Victor Davis Hanson  Much of the rural West opposes the Endangered Species Act. Can Wyoming declare that federally protected rats and bugs are not protected inside its state borders, when such pests obstruct construction of dams or highways Many conservatives oppose federal restrictions on gun sales. Could Oklahoma City declare handgun purchases within its citylimits free of federal firearms statutes Perhaps Little Rock could ignore a Supreme Court ruling and announce that gay marriage is not legal within its jurisdiction. On what rationale would liberals in California object to such nullifications  that neither state nor city had the right to ignore a federal law or to obstruct the law enforcement duties of federal officials Trump and the GOP can fight against sanctuary cities by cutting off federal funding and sending in federal agents to mandate the cities to follow the law. 2. Sanctuary cities undermine law enforcement. Not only do they refuse to cooperate with federal agents in deporting illegals, sanctuary cities make it more difficult for police officers to do their job. Some police officers in the Los Angeles Police Department LAPD expressed their frustration with the citys sanctuary city policy to Heather Mac Donald in 2004 We cant even talk about it, says a frustrated LAPD captain. People are afraid of a backlash from Hispanics. Another LAPD commander in a predominantly Hispanic, ganginfested district sighs I would get a firestorm of criticism if I talked about enforcing the immigration law against illegals. In that 2004 piece, Mac Donald documents how members of the LAPD were able to recognize known gang members, but couldnt do anything to apprehend them until they had committed a crime  despite the fact that they were illegals who repeatedly snuck back into the country. This is the case with other sanctuary cities as well. 3. Sanctuary cities are akin to roulette. The odds suggest that most illegal aliens detained by officials are not career felons and thus supposedly need not be turned over to ICE for deportation, writes Hanson. On the chance that some of their 10,000 released criminals will go on to commit further crimes in the manner of Juan LopezSanchez, officials then shrug that the public outcry will be episodic and quickly die down, or will at least not pose political problems as great as would come from deporting aliens. But the odds dont suggest this. Hanson notes that according to Mac Donald, Twothirds of all outstanding felony warrants in the city of Los Angeles involved illegal aliens  as well as 95 of outstanding murder warrants. Additionally, Jessica Vaughn of the Center for Immigration Studies found that in a ninemonth timeframe in 2014, sanctuary cities shielded 9,265 illegals from deportation, 62 percent of which had significant prior criminal histories and 2,320 of them were subsequently rearrested for new crimes, according to Daniel Horowitz at Conservative Review. There is no telling how many have committed crimes and were never caught, writes Horowitz. This is just a ninemonth snapshot of the devastation from sanctuary policies. As of last year, 69 of them were still at large. So much for not being a flight risk. According to Vaughn , from January 2014 to September 30, 2015, sanctuary cities rebuked over 17,000 detainers, 68 percent of which involved individuals with a prior criminal history. Based on these statistics, it would seem that the odds are against the cities residents who could be harmed by criminal aliens, which makes it no surprise that... 4. Crime has surged in sanctuary cities. The Daily Wire s Hank Berrien reported on the following from Louisiana attorney general Jeff Landry According to Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, crime has risen in sanctuary cities across the nation. Landry told the House Judiciary Committees Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security, that sanctuary city policies allow illegals to commit crimes, then roam free in our communities. Landrys appearance was prompted by the changed status of New Orleans, where city police are now banned from asking an individuals immigration status. Using recent statistics from Los Angeles, another sanctuary city, Landry asserted, Los Angeles saw all crime rise in 2015 violent crime up 19.9 percent, homicides up 10.2 percent, shooting victims up 12.6 percent, rapes up 8.6 percent, robberies up 12.3 percent, and aggravated assault up 27.5 percent  sanctuary cities encourage further illegal immigration and promote an underground economy that sabotages the tax base. This would make sense given the aforementioned statistics and the fact that there is a clear link between illegal immigration and crime . 5. There are an estimated 300 sanctuary cities, counties, and states, according to Vaughn. The full map on such jurisdictions can be seen here . Do you live in a sanctuary city ",bias
"The Left Says I Hate Myself For Voting Trump While Female. I Dont. I Just Hate You. By Amanda Prestigiacomo November 17, 2016 As a woman who rejects thirdwave feminism with the burning passion of a thousand suns on a regular basis, Ive had my fair share of feminists tell me that I only reject them and their ideas because I suffer from internalized misogyny, or, in other words, Im a selfloathing sexist. Heres exactly how Everyday Feminism defines internalized misogyny, if youre unfamiliar with bats crazy Internalized misogyny, by definition, is sexism turned inward toward ourselves and outward toward other women. It becomes innate as we are socialized to the norms of our culture that indicate, overtly and covertly, that women are less than men  less worthy, less strong, less dependable, less able, less of a leader, less logical  while also more than men more emotional, more irrational, more complex, more to manage. Of course, this is ridiculous, and I gave such an assertion about as much time as a I would a male feminist hitting on me zero seconds. But on Wednesday, I learned that Team Hillary, the political left, likewise thought me a selfloathing sexist who passed on my obligation to vote for Queen Pantsuit because I couldnt stomach the thought of a powerful woman, since I apparently believe women are lessers. In fact, Ia woman with a chronic case of internalized misogynycost Hillary the election not her decision to engage in potentially criminal activity, nor her inability to campaign her way out of a paper bag. It was my fault. Clinton campaign communications director @jessmc on election loss Internalized misogyny is a real thing #inners https//t.co/8RV74T0UIh  All In w/Chris Hayes @allinwithchris November 15, 2016 Yeah, no. I didnt pull the lever for Trump because I hate myself. I dont. Not even a little actually. I just hate you. Let me define you. You are the feminists who contend my uterus must dictate all my choices those who make it their mission to drag down any woman who has the audacity to veer from your ideology one iota. You are the feminists who tell me that theres a special place in hell for me if I dont cast my ballot for Crooked Hillary. Like all of a sudden feminists believe in God and an afterlife. LOL. You are the feminists who tell me Im super mean and shame women when I point out that bragging about murdering unborn babies is gross and despicable. By the way, it is gross and despicable . You are the feminists who demonize men with thinkpieces on how and why we should banish socalled  toxic masculinity  from this world. You are the feminists who shut men up because of their gender while simultaneously telling me gender is a social construct. And no, I will not cater to your preferred pronouns, you entitled brat. Protip Once the number of genders youve madeup passes the number of flavors at Baskin Robbins, its time to admit you have a problem. You are the social justice warriors who tell me Im a hateful, selfish, capitalistic pig from your iPhone at your local safe space, equipped with coloring books, bubbles and puppies, across from the Starbucks you work weekends at. You are the social justice warriors who viciously riot when you dont get your way, meanwhile youre not even registered to vote . You are the social justice warriors shoutingdown any free speech which doesnt perfectly align with your ideology, ironically in the name of tolerance and inclusiveness. You are the virtuesignaling celebrities who think I give a hoot about your political stance. Please, go ahead and move to Canada, no one will miss you. I certainly wont. You are the mainstream media so desperate for your leftist narrative that youll lie to the American people to advance it so hellbent on painting middleAmerica and Republicans as racist youll frame actual policy discussions into a segment of Whos The Biggest Xenophobe Republican Edition. You are the leftist telling me Im a racist for not supporting the divisive hate group Black Lives Matter. First of all, its mostly comprised of a bunch of loser white kids. Second of all, call me crazy, but once you start calling for and actually assassinating police officers , Im out. I know, how racist of me. You are leftists calling me an Islamophobe because I use the term radical Islam and resist an influx of refugees whom the FBI said we cannot properly vet pouring into our country. You see, this election had virtually nothing to do with Donald TrumpI could take him or leave himand almost everything to do with you, the left. Trump was indeed a protest vote he was a direct repudiation of everything you stand for and everything you tell me I should stand for by virtue of my uterus. So, no, Im not a selfloathing victim of the patriarchy who passed on a vote for Hillary because shes a woman. I just hate you. ",bias
"Media Claim Trump Transition Chaos. Trumps Way Ahead of Schedule. By Ben Shapiro November 18, 2016 The media, desperately in search of a narrative to cast the incoming Trump administration as dangerously incompetent, are once again overplaying their hands. Instead of focusing on the nepotistic fact that Trump relies heavily on his soninlaw, Jared Kushner, and his daughter, Ivanka  he invited them to a state meeting with Japan  theyre trying to claim that he just isnt moving fast enough on appointments. Thats nuts. Barack Obama didnt name his picks for Secretary of State, Defense, or Attorney General until December 1, nearly a month after the November 4, 2008 election. George W. Bush didnt name his picks for State, Defense, or Attorney General until midDecember December 16 for Colin Powell, December 28 for Donald Rumsfeld, December 22 for John Ashcroft. Bill Clinton didnt name his picks for those positions until at least December 22. George H.W. Bush was the fastest off the mark  he named James Baker Secretary of State the day after the November 8 election. Ronald Reagan waited until December 11 to get started Jimmy Carter waited until December 3. Were still waiting on Trumps State and Defense picks, but hes already out of the gate with Senator Jeff Sessions for Attorney General. Its November 17. The media are so eager to bury Trumps administration that they are falling all over themselves to do so. Instead of soberly covering potential problems with top level picks  Steve Bannon, for example, is a rotten pick , but not because hes a racist or antiSemite  the media keep proclaiming THE END IS NEAR. This sort of alarmism doesnt convince Americans, who dont really see why theres any giant rush to appoint people who arent going to be formally considered by the Senate until January 20 anyway. If this election was about repudiation of the media  and it was  the media arent doing themselves any favors when they promulgate factfree narratives while simultaneously attempting to label conservative outlets fake news. For years, Americans have assumed that the leftist media are ladling them fake news each day. Each day, the media seem determined to prove them right. Tags ",bias

"7 Things You Need To Know About Trump Attorney General Pick Jeff Sessions By Aaron Bandler November 18, 2016 Presidentelect Donald Trump has announced that his selection for attorney general is Sen. Jeff Sessions RAL, who has long been a favorite of conservatives. The Democrats already have the long knives out for Sessions, spitballing their usual accusations of racismwhich should indicate that Sessions will be an effective attorney general. Here are seven things you need to know about Sessions. 1. Sessions has a 78 percent liberty score on Conservative Review . Sessions has been in the Senate for 20 years, and has been described by the Washington Times as a tea partier before the tea party was cool, per Conservative Review s biography . 2. Sessions has been one of the leaders in the Senate in fighting against amnesty. For instance, Sessions was among the most prominent members of the Senate leading the opposition to the Gang of Eight Bill. National Review , which dubbed Sessions amnestys worst enemy, explained how Sessions would reveal true facts about the bill in an attempt to persuade some senators that hadnt decided how to vote on the legislation. Sessions and Sen. David Vitter RLA would find other clever ways to oppose the bill, such as an amendment to a resolution honoring the late Latino union organizer Cesar Chavez in which Vitter noted Chavezs opposition to illegal immigration, putting Sen. Bob Menendez DNJ in an awkward position. In 2015, Sessions introduced a bill that would overhaul the immigration system, according to Conservative Review  Overturned the Zadvydas v. Davis Supreme Court case that Obama is using as an excuse to release criminal aliens after six months of detention Explicitly deputized the states to enforce federal immigration law Eliminated sanctuary cities by cutting off DHS and DOJ law enforcement grants Expedited deportation of gang members Applied the ramifications of treating illegal aliens as criminal aliens to those convicted of drunk driving Clamped down on loopholes that allow legal immigrants who commit crimes to continue on the path to citizenship instead of getting deported this would address cases like the legal immigrant who murdered the family in the Washington, D.C. mansion murders Sessions has also fought efforts to increase legal immigration, as he has railed against it as the primary source of lowwage immigration into the United States. What we need now is immigration moderation slowing the pace of new arrivals so that wages can rise, welfare rolls can shrink and the forces of assimilation can knit us all more closely together, Sessions wrote in a 2015 oped in the Washington Post . 3. Sessions has also spearheaded efforts to crack down on budgetary issues. According to Conservative Review s biography of Sessions In January 2011, he was named Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee. In this capacity, he led the Republican charge against Majority Leader Harry Reid and Barack Obama for not offering a serious budget proposal, given that the Senate had not passed a budget since April 2009. He has fought guerilla warfare, often a lonely battle, against Democrats spending by raising budget point of orders against the breach of budget caps. He has even fought his own party when his office put out devastating research against the RyanMurray budget deal. Sessions has also been a strong leader on welfare reform and publishing studies and data on the extent of the welfare state. Sessions has voted against the TARP bailout, stimulus bills, and increases to the debt limit and has traveled through his state with charts warning of the United States crippling debt, per the Washington Post . 4. Sessions endorsed Trump early on. To the surprise of many in the establishment, Sessions endorsed Trump in February, declaring , I believe we are on a movement that must not fade away. This is a campaign, this is a movement. The American people are not happy with their government. It shouldnt have come as a surprise though, given Sessions record on immigration and that Sessions tends to be more protectionist on trade. 5. Sessions is wellliked by his Senate colleagues on a personal level. According to the Washington Post  Say what you will about him, former longtime Senate Democratic communications aide Jim Manley told the Almanac of American Politics. He was always nice to the late Ted Kennedy and other Democrats as well. Even people who have run against him have nice things to say about him. StanleyBecker talked to Susan Parker, a Democrat who tried to unseat Sessions in 2002. During a debate, she asked for a tissue and Sessions handed her one. She joked she would use it to dry her eyes when Sessions made her cry, and he responded Please dont say that. Thats my nightmare. I promise Ill be nice. Its no wonder then that Sessions will likely be confirmed by the Senate. 6. Accusations of racism against Sessions are absurd. When President Ronald Reagan nominated Sessions, who at the time was a U.S. attorney, to a federal judge, the Democrats smeared Sessions with accusations of racism, which included Calling a black attorney boy. Quipping about the Ku Klux Klan I used to think they were OK, but they are pot smokers. Joking that a white attorney was a traitor to his race because he was collaborating with civil rights groups. Calling the NAACP and ACLU unAmerican. Prosecuting a civil rights organization for voter fraud. The last point isnt racist at all. The jokes, as Ben Shapiro has written , were made in front of the black lawyer even the lawyer accusing Sessions of racism acknowledged that Sessions was joking. Clearly Sessions meant them as harmless jokes. Sessions has also denied calling the lawyer boy. The civil rights group Sessions prosecuted has faced accusations of voter fraud for many years. Sessions record on race actually shows that he has consistently fought against racism, as The Weekly Standard s Mark Hemingway writes As a U.S. Attorney he filed several cases to desegregate schools in Alabama. And he also prosecuted the head of the state Klan, Henry Francis Hays, for abducting and killing Michael Donald, a black teenager selected at random. Sessions insisted on the death penalty for Hays. When he was later elected the state Attorney General, Sessions followed through and made sure the Hays executed. The successful prosecution of Hays also led to a 7 million civil judgment against the Klan, effectively breaking the back of the KKK in Alabama. 7. As attorney general, Sessions would uphold the rule of law. The reason why Sessions has been such an immigration hawk is that he supports the rule of law. He has also fought against judicial activist nominees and is a strong supporter of the death penalty. Between that and his legal background as a U.S. attorney and Alabama attorney general, there is every reason to believe that Sessions will follow the law and not politicize the Justice Department. His interpretation of the law will not please everyone, but I predict it will be fairly applied without fear or favor, Robert Driscoll , former deputy assistant attorney general, wrote in National Review . Clear cases will be prosecuted with vigor. Creative interpretations of the law may cease, but the meatandpotatoes work of the division intentional discrimination, police misconduct, disability law will continue apace, conducted without impropriety or political favoritism. That alone will be a breath of fresh air. Tags ",bias

"Democratic Congressman Threatens Violence If GOP Tries To Defund Planned Parenthood By Hank Berrien November 21, 2016 The Democratic congressman who is challenging House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi, Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, threatened a Youngstown street fight if Donald Trump attempts to defund Planned Parenthood. Speaking with Jake Tapper on CNNs State of the Union on Sunday, Ryan intimated that defunding Planned Parenthood wasnt the only stimulus he would need to launch violence. He stated, If he tries to defund Planned Parenthood, if he tries to kick people off their health insurance, if they try to privatize Medicare or cut taxes for the wealthy, you know, we are going to have a Youngstown street fight in the Capitol. Youngstown has been plagued by violent street fights in the recent past last May and August violence erupted on the streets of the city. Ryan called Trumps infrastructure plan a bunch of smoke and mirrors. He added that he didnt blame Pelosi for focusing any specific economic issues I cant in good conscience hang this election around Nancy Pelosis neck, of course. But, moving forward, we have to win congressional seats in areas of the country that voted for Donald Trump, even in my district, where they voted for me and they voted for Donald Trump. Ryans campaign to replace Pelsoi is picking up steam on Sunday, New York Rep. Kathleen Rice endorsed him, stating, He has a lot of good ideas, but maybe most importantly, he also isnt suggesting he has all the answers  he has stressed that he wants these conversations to be ongoing, that he wants more voices in the conversation so that we can work together to craft our message and forge a winning strategy, Rice said in a statement.

"SNOWFLAKE Colbert Didnt Want To Write Jokes About Trump Winning By Hank Berrien November 21, 2016 Conversing with fellow Daily Show comic John Oliver at the Montclair Film Festival on Saturday night, Late Show unfunny host Stephen Colbert admitted that he couldnt even conceive that Donald trump would win the presidency so much so that he couldnt write jokes bout Trump winning for election night. In the roughly twohour discussion and QA titled Wow, That Was Weird, Montclair Film Festival executive director Tom Hall set the somber tone by allowing, When we planned this evening, I think we all thought wed be looking back with laughter instead of looking forward with deep concern about the uncertainty we face. Speaking of the Late Show s Election Night special on Showtime, Colbert admitted that the staff was prepared for every result of the election except the one that actually transpired There was not a bear big enough in the world that we werent loaded for. We were so loaded for every possible eventuality. We had so many guests. We had so many pretaped pieces, all based on a different eventuality. We had three shows Hillary Clinton wins and we know Hillary Clinton wins and we dont know, because its not called before the shows over Donald Trumps going to win and we dont know, because everyone said he had such a narrow path to victory. Thats not wishful thinking, thats what everyone was saying. And then there was the last show, which is the show we did, which is Donald Trump is going to win and we know hes going to win. My execs and my writers were like, You dont want to write something for that and Im like, No There is nothing you can write. You dont understand. I have 400 people in my theater. If we know Donald Trump is going to win, its going to be like doing standup comedy for one of those Chilean soccer stadiums where the villagers watch you execute one of the natives. There will be no laughter We only did about 20 minutes of material before we went, F it, its going to be him, lets just talk for another hour. So I think we have two and a half whole shows that you will never see of material that we had to kill that night. Colbert moaned that the special was the hardest thing Ive ever done in my life, adding, I was tying my tie at 1030 and I went, Oh, he took Ohio. Oh, well, we expected that. He took it by 11 points. Wow Thats not expected. And then over my guests shoulders, people kept holding up signs that said, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska. He revealed that numerous fake commercials were prepared, but none of them were appropriate once we knew we were playing to an audience of the condemned. Our audience was sobbing openly. And those are people who work for me, like my cameramen. As Daily Wire EditorinChief Ben Shapiro pointed out years ago , Colberts manipulative act has been laced with hatred of conservatives He engages in Conservativeface. He needs no makeup or bulbous appendage to play a conservative  after all, conservatives come in every shape and size. Instead, he acts as though he is a conservative  an idiotic, racist, sexist, bigoted, brutal conservative. He outArchie Bunkers Archie Bunker. His audience laughs and scoffs at brutal religious Colbert who wishes to persecute gays they chortle at evil sexist Colbert who thinks men are victims of sexism. This is the purpose of Colberts routine. His show is about pure hatred for conservatives in the same way that blackface was about pure hatred of blacks. In order to justify their racism, racists had to create a false perception of blacks in the same way, Colbert and his audience can justify their racism only by creating a false perception of conservatives. On Saturday night, Colbert waxed eloquent over his fear of a Trump presidency, arguing, Im all for giving him a chance, but dont give him an inch. Because I believed everything he said, and I remember everything he said. And its horrifying. Its possible. The job changes a man. Thats the cliche of the presidency. He pontificated Every president tries to achieve what they promised and you can say, Well, there are levers of power in Washington that can slow him down. But two things One is theyre cowards. Second is that the levers in Washington are apparently merely attached to blinking red lights that make the people happy when they pull. Because they tried to stop Trump. Everybody tried to stop Trump, do not delude yourself. Everyone except the people hes going to appoint tried to stop him and they didnt. He owes them nothing. He goes out on the balcony and he says to the crowd, Shall I do it And they say, Yes. And he says, It shall be so. And the balcony is Twitter. He goes onto Twitter and he goes, What do you think Do you think Im right Thats what scares me, that he owes the checks and balances of Washington nothing because they tried to stop him and they couldnt. And hes a vindictive person. So its all going to be fine. Merry Christmas. No There is nothing you can write. Stephen Colbert Colbert concluded, The next person who says to me, You must be happy on a certain level, is going to have their eye carved out. So thats the man underneath the comedy mask . . .",bias

"Obama Wont Go Away After Hes Done. Thats Good News. By November 21, 2016 So, soontobeexPresident Obama wont be going away anytime soon. After George W. Bush left office, he essentially went silent. He had no criticism for President Obama he didnt sound off about Mitt Romney or Donald Trump. He went away. Not so for Obama. It seems that Barack Obama will follow the Jimmy Carter pathway to Annoyingland hell be commenting whenever possible. After acknowledging that Bush could not have been more gracious to me when I came in, Obama said, As an American citizen who cares deeply about our country, if there are issues that have less to do with the specifics of some legislative proposal or battle or go to core questions about our values and ideals, and if I think that its necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals, Ill examine it when it comes. This comes as welcome news for Republicans. Obamas policy unpopularity  and his tendency to lecture from on high to Americans in rural areas  means that hell suck all the oxygen out of the room when it comes to criticizing Trump and Republicans. Middle Americans voted for Trump in order to sound off against Obamas obvious scorn for them. Heres what Obama had to say about those who didnt vote for Trump in todays Der Spiegel  If you look at the new generation of Americans, they reflect the vision that I spoke about. Theyre diverse. They believe in tolerance. Theyre accepting of things like samesex marriage. They believe in integration. The problem, though, is that young people are less likely to vote than older people. What results is a situation in which sometimes the elections dont fully reflect the views of the American population. Essentially, the presidentelect was supported by about 27 percent of the American population. One of our challenges, historically, is that we have very low voting rates, even during presidential elections. This sort of language drove Americans to Trump. And if Obama continues to critique Trump from the outside with this sort of language, not only will he be doing Trump a favor, hell be preventing any other Democrat from taking a leading role in opposing Trump. Hell become the point of resistance for his own party  and his party wont be able to escape his shadow. Obamas ego has already cost his party the presidency, the Senate, the House, a bevy of state legislators and governors mansions. Now it may cost them the future. Excellent. ",bias
"Meet All The Pundits Pandering For A Trump Adminstration Job By Aaron Bandler November 22, 2016 With Donald Trump set to take office in a couple of months, a number of his lackeys have reportedly been in talks about possibly serving in the administration. As of this writing, there are three proTrump pundits that might be in the Trump administration. Eric Bolling. Politico reported that Bolling was seen at Trump Tower and was reportedly discussed for a position in the Department of Commerce. What exactly that position that will be is not clear. Bolling told Politico that he cant confirm anything. Geraldo Rivera flatout asked Bolling on The Five if he had been offered a job, and Bolling gave a nonanswer . Bolling has been with Fox News since 2008, where he is the cohost of The Five and hosts the weekend show Cashin In . Before then, he had been an analyst on CNBC and a New York Mercantile Exchange NYMEX trader. Bolling has been an ardent supporter of Trump from the getgo, to the point where he resorted to some loony ideas . Laura Ingraham. According to CNN Money , Ingraham is being heavily considered for President Trumps press secretary. Here is what Ingraham has said on the matter I am honored to be considered for that job and other jobs. So well see what happens, Ingraham said on Fox News. She cautioned I think people are getting a little far ahead of the narrative. But she strongly suggested that some sort of Trump administration post is in the works. Its a big decision, but Im at the point where, if my country needs me, and if I can do something to actually, you know, advance the Trump agenda, which is stuff I have written about now for 15 years, with trade, immigration and just renewing America, then I obviously have to seriously consider that, she told Foxs Tucker Carlson. Like Bolling, Ingraham, who has been a nationally syndicated radio host since 2001 , has also been an early supporter of Trump, going as far as saying that #NeverTrump conservatives support partial birth abortion, and her website, LifeZette, attacked conservatives like Ben Shapiro for opposing the AltRight. As usual, Shapiro punched back hard . Jeanine Pirro. Pirro, accompanied by Rudy Giuliani, was seen headed inside Trump Tower, which has led to speculation that she is being considered for a job in the Trump administration, according to Page Six . What that job would be is not known. Pirro also has been an early Trump supporter, and she has claimed to have known him for 30 years . Pirros exhusband, Al Pirro, has been described as a man Donald Trump keeps on retainer as a realestate lawyer, and Trump once donated 20,000 to Pirro when she ran for New York state attorney general. Pirro has been with Fox News since 2006 and hosts Justice with Judge Jeanine on Saturdays. She also has an extensive legal career as a prosecutor in the state of New York and initially challenged Hillary Clinton when she ran for reelection in the Senate before dropping out to run for state attorney general.

"Video Underwater Handgun Takes Fishing to the Next Level of Fun By Chase Stephens November 23, 2016 For some people, fishing is a long, boring day of sitting and staring endlessly at a rod and reel that may never get a bite. But what if you could get down with those mocking waterbreathers and have highnoon shootout with them the way nature intended Well, thats just what some Florida boys thought when they decided to take their modified Glock 9mm pistol into the Gulf of Mexico to help deal with the infestation of Lionfish. TheSickest provides some more details on the Lionfish overpopulation problem and the boys creative way to address it Lionfish are an invasive species with no natural predators whos females lay a staggering two million eggs a year. The intersection between ammunitionhappy Americans and the determent of an overpopulated species is where the the use of this new sporting phenomenon was birthed. Lionsfish were never intended to be in the Gulf of Mexico, and while its speculated that their transplant may be linked to a hurricanes back in the 90s, because of their rapid reproductive nature the waters have become flooded by their presence. A single Lionsfish consumes 80 reefs edible baitfish within five weeks of arriving on that reef  incredibly damaging to plant that is the cornerstone of the underwater ecosystem. The issue has gotten to a point where entering the Florida coast at any time can mean running across thousands of Lionsfish, just posted up chilling. The good news is that the introduction of the gun has the potential of bringing hunters and otherwise uninterested fishers to the gulf for a fun filled time of shooting underwater, an activity that actually looks like a blast.

For you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps. And yet youll ask me that question. I think thats a very rude question, to be honest with you. Trump cant defend why he is wasting precious time promoting his business interests instead of campaigning. Trump doesnt have a single campaign event scheduled until 7 PM. He has given up a critical day of campaign time to get publicity for his new hotel. When Trump got called out for some very unpresidential scheduling priorities, his response was to attack the reporter. The Republican nominee is not behaving like a person who is willing to give everything to be elected the next president, and every time he leaves his Fox News bubble, Donald Trump opens his mouth and reminds voters of why he should never be elected president.

"Hillary Clinton is keeping her foot on the gas pedal by hammering Donald Trump for taking the day off to promote his hotel built with undocumented workers instead of campaigning. Video Clinton said Hillary Clinton could probably spend 24 hours a day for the rest of the campaign doing nothing but targeting Trumps hypocrisies. While Trump was trying to drum up business for his struggling new DC hotel, Hillary Clinton was winning more early votes in the state of Florida. There are two competing messages in the media currently about the election. The first message is that Democrats are blowing out Republicans in early voting. The second message is that a few state polls have shown Trump leading by a little in Florida and gaining ground in New Hampshire. It is possible that both of these stories are correct. Democrats are blowing out Republicans in early voting, and with no new sex assault stories dominating the news, some Republicans may be coming back to Trump. The important thing for Hillary Clinton and Democrats is not to let up. Democrats are very close to generation defining win, but victory is not sealed yet. More polling will need to be done to see if the two state polls were outliers or if this is a trend, but the polls may not matter. If most of the ballots in states like North Carolina and Florida are cast before election day, the polls may end up meaning very little. Hillary Clinton is in a great position, but judging from her own remarks, she is still working hard to close the deal on November 8.

Just 79 percent of all Republicans surveyed say they are voting for their partys nominee.

Besides his brief July bump, Trump hasnt led Clinton in national polling since May.

"By Sean Colarossi on Wed, Oct 26th, 2016 at 736 pm This type of language from someone who used to be a member of the United States Congress is abhorrent, but its also to be expected in the Trump era of American politics. Share on Twitter Print This Post Hopefully, as a country, well return to a time in our politics when violent language is shocking and rare. But this year, when the man at the top of the Republican ticket has repeatedly encouraged his supporters to revolt if he loses, isnt likely to be that time. On Wednesday, former GOP Congressman Joe Walsh, a rightwing extremist who now hosts a talk radio show, followed his nominees lead and told urged his Twitter followers to grab their guns on Nov. 9 if Hillary Clinton is elected. Tweet On November 8th, Im voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, Im grabbing my musket. You in  Joe Walsh @WalshFreedom October 26, 2016 This type of language from someone who used to be  and thankfully no longer is  a member of the United States Congress is abhorrent, but its also to be expected in the Trump era of American politics. After all, not long ago Trump himself instructed his supporters to revolt if Clinton decides to fulfill her constitutional duty and nominate Supreme Court judges. If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks, the Republican nominee said. Although the Second Amendment people  maybe there is, I dont know. More recently, Trump said that hed like to see what happens if Clintons bodyguards were disarmed. I think her bodyguards should drop all weapons. Disarm immediately, he said. Take their guns away, lets see what happens to her. Not only does Walshs rhetoric align perfectly with what Trump has suggested at various points throughout this campaign, but its also a continuation of dangerous language that the former Republican congressman seems to enjoy using. Earlier in the year, when five police officers were gunned down in Dallas, Walsh blamed President Obama, tweeting This is now war. Watch out Obama. Watch out black lives matter punks. Real America is coming after you. Before Trump hit the scene, this type of rhetoric existed, but it often only came from the most extreme elements in either party. Now it has the encouragement of a major party presidential nominee. On Nov. 9, we shouldnt hope that people take up arms to protest the results of the election. We should hope that when Trump loses, hell take a lot of this dangerous rhetoric with him.",bias
"By Sean Colarossi on Wed, Oct 26th, 2016 at 834 pm Not even an overwhelming victory by Hillary Clinton is likely to convince Republicans that they should do their job. Share on Twitter Print This Post Since Republicans have essentially conceded that Donald Trump is going to lose the general election to Hillary Clinton, theyre already making plans in the event that she decides to do her job and nominate Supreme Court justices. According to a report from the Huffington Post on Wednesday, one conservative thinker says that John McCains recent suggestion that his party should block any nominee put forward by Clinton isnt that farfetched. The report Some conservatives certainly seem to be warming up to McCains controversial suggestion last week that Senate Republicans should dig in their heels and block any and all Supreme Court nominees put forth by a future President Hillary Clinton. Who needs a fully functioning Supreme Court after all As a matter of constitutional law, the Senate is fully within its powers to let the Supreme Court die out, literally, wrote the Cato Institutes Ilya Shapiro in a column Wednesday on The Federalist. Shapiro is wellversed in constitutional issues, and his argument has a legal, if contorted, basis. Nothing in the Constitution explicitly stands in the way of senators who would be willing to destroy the nations highest court  if not an entire branch of the federal government  to stop Clinton from selecting judges who share her views.  To Shapiro, theres nothing wrong with even more Senate obstructionism because the Constitution is completely silent on how the upper chamber provides its advice and consent on the presidents nominees.  So when you get past the gotcha headlines, breathless reportage, and Inauguration Day, if Hillary Clinton is president it would be completely decent, honorable, and in keeping with the Senates constitutional duty to vote against essentially every judicial nominee she names, he concluded. The original argument from Republicans was that they would block President Obamas Supreme Court appointment until voters had a chance to weigh in via the Nov. 8 election. Forget the fact that this isnt how the constitutional system is meant to operate, but that was their reasoning. Now, faced with the growing prospect that Hillary Clinton will be elected the 45th President of the United States, they are beginning to change their tune. The obstruction that defined the Republican Party throughout Obamas presidency looks like it will be sticking around after he is gone. Its yet another reason why downballot races are more critical than ever this year.",bias

Khan would be alive today, George, because I wouldnt have been in Iraq  I was opposed to the war in Iraq. As Hillary Clinton and many objective sources have noted repeatedly throughout the campaign, Donald Trump was not opposed to the war in Iraq from the beginning. Had he been president at the time, the war still would have taken place because Trump was in favor of it. In fact, Trumps campaign rhetoric today indicates that he would be a president who acts recklessly and would only embolden our enemies. This would make the world a more dangerous place and only increase the odds that America gets mired in more conflicts, not less. For their part, the Clinton campaign has continued to stand up to Trumps attacks on the Khan family. In an emotional new ad released days ago, Capt. Khans father recounts how his son died protecting everyone in his unit. Khans father asked of Trump, Would my son have a place in your America The answer to Mr. Khans question is a resounding no, as Trump has promised to ban Muslims  like the Khans  from even entering the United States. For those living here already, a President Trump would treat them like criminals. Donald Trump will likely continue to rewrite history when it comes to his initial support of military intervention in Iraq. But after spending so much time throwing mud at the Khan family, its unlikely that anybody will buy it.",bias
"The Washington Post reported  The Democratic National Committee has filed papers in federal court against the Republican National Committee, accusing it of violating a 1982 court order intended to prevent voter intimidation. The motion filed in New Jersey says the RNC has supported the efforts of presidential candidate Donald Trumps campaign to intimidate and discourage minority voters from voting in the 2016 Presidential Election. Trump has recently been urging his supporters to monitor polling places on Election Day. Democrats arent going to stand by and let Trump supporters waltz into polling places in heavily Democratic areas to intimidate voters. Trumps call for his supporters to go to polling places that arent their own to watch voters is a clear violation of the consent decree. The Republican Party, which has completely abandoned the idea of winning elections based on ideas, is firmly standing behind their nominee because the same party that was too weak to stop Trump during the primary is certainly not going to stand in the way of what might be their only chance of winning. People should not be afraid to go to the polls and vote. No matter who you are voting for, Democrats have your back. The Republican Party has been trying to suppress the vote and intimidate voters for years. Democrats are on to their tricks, and as the lawsuit demonstrates, Trump and the GOP are not going to get away with intimidating voters.",bias
"By Hrafnkell Haraldsson on Thu, Oct 27th, 2016 at 756 am Trump used undocumented labor to build Trump Tower and workers told The Washington Post in 2015 they were working on his hotel illegally   So Donald Trump has responded to Hillary Clintons accusation that he used undocumented workers to build his new D.C. hotel, a 263room luxury hotel just blocks from the White House. Trump claims he used no undocumented workers  and as we saw earlier , oh yeah, Hillary Clinton sleeps three days at a time. Trumps decision to attend the grand opening rather than campaign raised many eyebrows, not just in the Clinton camp. Republican strategist Steve Schmidt told MSNBC, He is not doing any of the normal activities that youd be doing 13 days out in a presidential race for somebody whos competitive. You dont take a timeout to tend to your business interests. As Libby Nelson wrote at Vox , Clinton is making her closing argument. Trump is making infomercials. All this seems to have stung the thinskinned Trump, who previously set aside his campaign to open a golf course in Scotland. As CBS News Sopan Deb tweets , Trumps defense was a little odd, to say the least Trumps riff on his hotel is worth your time to read. Denies ever using undocumented immigrants and says Clinton sleeps for 3 days at a time pic.twitter.com/Rlsbebzk2Y  Sopan Deb @SopanDeb October 27, 2016 The Republican nominee protested to CNNs Dana Bash , For you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop, and then she goes home and sleeps. It is literally impossible for Trump to hear criticism without responding by attacking somebody else. Trumps defense reveals a man who is overly sensitive to criticism he works all the time while Clinton sleeps for three days. He says he took an hour off it was a bit more than that to open his new hotel while she wants to sleep all the time. He says Clinton gives one speech and then sleeps for three days. In fact, Clinton made two Get Out the Vote stops in Florida yesterday she makes an appearance with the president and first lady today in North Carolina and has two appearances scheduled in Iowa for the day after. And Trumps heated denial of using undocumented workers is unconvincing, considering his track record in that regard. It is a fact, as Hillary Clinton said yesterday, that Donald Trump once again used undocumented labor to build a hotel. He used undocumented labor to build Trump Tower . And The Washington Post reports that Trumps new downtown D.C. hotel was built thanks to the efforts of a large workforce that included Hispanic construction workers, including some workers who say they are undocumented . Said one worker in 2015, The majority of us are Hispanics, many who came illegally. The old saw about the man who protests too much comes to mind, in reading Trumps denial. This is a man who has a history of exploiting undocumented immigrants and according to the workers themselves, this remains true. Nonsensical talk about his opponent sleeping for three days straight is pure deflection, and it wont work. Trump already has his clothing lines made in China, Mexico, and elsewhere, and he has used undocumented labor even while railing against the loss of American jobs. Trump is a hypocrite, and hissy fits and deflection are no answer to the allegations against him, and certainly no recommendation for the office of president.",bias
"By Rmuse on Thu, Oct 27th, 2016 at 1036 am To avoid climateending global temperature rise, it is critical for the world to transition off fossil fuels and embrace renewable, clean energy sources. Share on Twitter Print This Post The following is an opinion column by R Muse Over the past few months, there has been a dearth of good news, and if there did happen to be anything good to report it was overshadowed by the national clown show that is a typical American election. Where there has not been one iota of good news is on climate change. Even dismissing the horrible flooding, wildfires, droughts, sea level rise, melting ice caps, hurricanes and worldwide food shortages, there have only been dire reports on the level of CO2 permeating the atmosphere and the subsequent yearly recordsetting rise in global temperatures. This week, while most Americans were living, breathing and bleeding over Donald Trump and the tortuouslylong presidential campaign, the International Energy Agency offered up some good news for the climate, the Earths population, and even for America. The good news for the planet came in the form of an announcement on Tuesday by the International Energy Agency IEA that stated according to new data, for the first time Renewable energy sources have passed coal as the largest new source of electricity in the world. It may not seem like such fantastic news, but climate scientists the world over have warned that if human beings are going to avoid that climateending 2degree C rise in global temperatures, it is critical for the world to transition off of carbonproducing fossil fuels and embrace renewable, clean energy generating sources. This is particularly true for getting off dirty coalfired electrical generation plants that are responsible for a quarter of Americas C02 emissions. Carbon dioxide emissions are one of the main culprits contributing to climate change driven by global warming. The IEA report revealed that solar and wind account for nearly twothirds of current renewable energy growth and interestingly those increases are occurring in, and coming from, developing and industrialized nations alike. For a developing nation, it makes perfect sense to embrace cheaper renewable energy as opposed to any fossil fuelgenerated power sources whether they are dirty coalfired plants or notquiteasdirty natural gasburning generating plants. The IEA also revised its earlier projections for renewable energys continued expansion and growth and  significantly increased the amount of  green energy  it expects to  come on line  over the next five years. Renewable energy includes socalled green sources such as biomass, biogas, eligible biomass and small hydroelectric sources, according to the Environmental Protection Agency EPA. Both terms, renewable and green energy, include solar and wind generating sources and depending on the context they can be interchangeable. In addition to prorenewable policies such as the Paris climate agreement and to a lesser extent the AmericaChina deal to roll back coalgenerated emissions, there has been a significant price decline that is helping drive the growth in renewables particularly in solar. And, the IEA projected that the worldwide costs for solargenerated power will continue declining by an additional 25 percent over the next five years. Onshore wind generated electricity costs will drop by at least another 15 percent during that same fiveyear period. Although the IEA report was incredibly good news for the entire planet, there was some extra good news in the report about Americas transition to renewable energy. According to the IEAs MediumTerm Renewable Market Report, the United States is adding renewables at a faster rate than demand is growing. What that means for the climate is that renewables are not only covering the everincreasing demand for electricity but are now supplanting some fossil fuel electricity. Still, America has a long way to go because wind and solar generating sources make up a small portion of Americas electricity. In time and if the Koch brothers allow it, America may catch up to stilldeveloping nations where renewable energy accounts for about half of new electric power sources. Industrialization is fueling a rapid increase in demand for electricity that is best generated with cheaper renewable energy. Although there appears to be no downside in this bit of good news, the growth of renewable energy does have economic implications. The dirty coal industry is facing some strugglesin part due to the glut of oil and lower national gas prices, financial mismanagement, and new cleanair regulations, but the amount of CO2 driving climate change is a testament that they have had a good long reign in providing dirty fuel to generate electricity. It is noteworthy that as coal jobs may be declining the solar industry is growing and thriving to more than take up the slack in any lost coal jobs. The IEA couldnt pass up the chance to note one sticking point in their otherwise encouraging report  persistent challenges of heating and transportation energy  that renewables are not affecting. However, since the IEA only monitored and tracked the worlds transistor from oil and gas to biofuels, they note that as electric and hybrid vehicles continue to increase around the world, they will be connected to the same electrical grid that is steadily getting a little greener, significantly cheaper, and one Hell of a lot more friendly for the climate and the people. It is a mystery how Republicans beholden to the Koch brothers and dirty fossil fuel industry, particularly the dirty coal industry, will absorb this good news. In the past eight years, Republicans , the Kochs, their lobbyists at the Heritage Foundation, Americans for Prosperity, and the American Legislative Exchange Council ALEC have made killing renewable energy one of their primary goals. It is likely that the IEAs report will signal they are not winning the war on renewable energy and in the past that may have been worrisome. But now that more Americans are benefitting from renewable energy, particularly solar, Republicans will have a difficult time convincing them to stop getting free electricity from the Sun and saving the climate for their childrens future something the IEAs report never mentions. image J Pat Carter",bias
"Bloomberg reported  To compensate for this, Trumps campaign has devised another strategy, which, not surprisingly, is negative. Instead of expanding the electorate, Bannon and his team are trying to shrink it. We have three major voter suppression operations under way, says a senior official. Theyre aimed at three groups Clinton needs to win overwhelmingly idealistic white liberals, young women, and African Americans. Trumps invocation at the debate of Clintons WikiLeaks emails and support for the TransPacific Partnership was designed to turn off Sanders supporters. The parade of women who say they were sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and harassed or threatened by Hillary is meant to undermine her appeal to young women. And her 1996 suggestion that some African American males are super predators is the basis of a belowtheradar effort to discourage infrequent black voters from showing up at the pollsparticularly in Florida. The effort was obvious, and according to the polling, it is failing. Voter turnout among young women is expected to rise according to the latest Harvard IOP young voters poll. Sanders started flocking towards Clinton in August , and havent left, and early voting statistics show that AfricanAmerican turnout is solid in swing states. The Trump campaign has realized that they dont have enough supporters to win, so they are adopting tactics that run contrary to the heart of democracy to shrink the electorate in critical states. However, for voter suppression efforts like Trumps to be effective, the campaign must have a credible messenger. Donald Trump is not a credible messenger to any of the voters that he is trying to deter, and he has no effective surrogates that are capable of delivering his message. A voter suppression effort was expected from the Trump campaign. What is unexpected is that the campaign would publicly brag about it. People on all sides of the political spectrum who care about basic democratic institutions should be alarmed by Trumps public attack on democracy. The good news for all Americans is that Democrats are already fighting back , and the Trump campaigns dark efforts to steal an election appear to be failing.",bias

Share on Twitter Print This Post Rep. Paul Ryan could be out of a job after the election, as divided House Republicans are already plotting to fire their Speaker if Trumps defeat triggers a big enough loss of House seats. If Democrats pick up 15 House seats or more, Speaker Ryan is going to have a major problem because his job will be in jeopardy. Politico reported that Ryans enemies in the House Freedom Caucus are divided over whether or not to support him. Conservative House Republicans are plotting with one another and openly pining for Ryans ouster because he refuses to change the House rules to all more conservative legislation to be passed. The Hill is also reporting that conservativeHouse Republicans are deeply divided on keeping Ryan, but Donald Trump could be the wild card that mobilizing an opposition effort to the Speaker, The businessman has repeatedly criticized Ryans leadership and was stung after the Speaker said he would not longer defend Trump after a 2005 tape emerged in which the GOP nominee speaks lewdly about groping and kissing women. Win or lose on Nov. 8, Trump could put pressure on House Republicans to oppose Ryan in a speakership contest. Ryan is certain to be leading a smaller House majority in January. The size of Trumps defeat on election day will help decide how many seats Republicans lose. Eight of the nine House Republicans who cast votes against Ryan for Speaker initially will still be around to vote against him again in January. Those close to Ryan say that he would step down as Speaker before getting into a protracted fight with his own party, but the walls are closing in on Speaker Ryan. The damage Trump is causing isnt limited to their White House dreams. Trump may also cost Paul Ryan his job as Speaker of the House.",bias
"At a Donald Trump rally in North Carolina, a proud Ginger Glover waved a Lyin Hillary Doll with a special edition noose on it. Watch a clip with Glover at the Wednesday rally here via NBC News  Glover said the noose was her way of making a point that Hillary Clinton should be incarcerated at the very least, but when asked said she doesnt think Clinton should be killed. Yet her employees put the noose on the doll for her and she brought it out in public and waved it around. For effect. Where is all of the Trump rallies violent rhetoric and imagery going Donald Trump seems to attract people who are angry and want someone to blame. The Washington Post did an incredible story on Melanie Austin, a Trump supporter who said Trump sees the world like she does. She realized this days after she had been injected with something intended to calm her, after she was involuntarily committed for homicidal ideation against President Obama. The first time she had seen him, at a rally in June, she was just beginning to realize how many people saw the world the way she did, that she was one among millions. At the time, her hips were still sore from a series of injections intended to calm her. She had gotten them in February, during a difficult time in her life, when she had been involuntarily hospitalized for several weeks after what she called a rant, a series of online postings that included one saying that Obama should be hanged and the White House fumigated and burned to the ground. On her discharge papers, in a box labeled medical problem, a doctor had typed homicidal ideation. Donald Trump and the altright, and indeed way too many elected Republicans, have already pointed these folks at Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama as Evil People Who Must Be Harmed. When you attract unstable people who are easily manipulated out of anger and fear and then direct them to harm someone, as Trump and his advisers have done suggesting Hillary Clinton might be shot and saying she should be executed with a firing squad, you are responsible for inciting violence. Things are not going well for Trump supporters, and even buoyed as they are with unscientific online polls and delusions fed by the altright media and Fox News, they smell defeat. Perhaps thats not connected to this specific woman who brought a Hillary Clinton doll in a noose to wave at a Trump rally last night, but it is a trend were seeing in general  angry Trump fans using more and more violent rhetoric. There will be more of this, not less, as Trumps likely defeat becomes reality outside of tinfoil circles. This is political intimidation that mimics Donald Trumps despotic promises to jail Clinton even though shes been cleared of wrongdoing in all of the relentless Republican investigations into her activities as Secretary of State. Of which there will be plenty more, Republicans promise us, should she win  because just like the Trump camp doesnt want you to vote, Republicans only want government to work when theyre not in power. The potent mixture of tinfoil and rage is creating a toxic brew of violent fantasies and rhetoric among Trump supporters. Image Screencap from NBC News video",bias

In a story that sounds very familiar, former Miss Finland Ninni Laaksonen told the tabloid IltaSanomat that the now Republican nominee grabbed her butt just before Trump and three other beauty pageant contests went on the air for the Late Show with David Letterman in 2006. Before the show we were photographed outside the building, Laaksonen is quoted by Haaretz . Trump stood next to me and suddenly he squeezed my butt. He really grabbed my butt. I dont think anybody saw it but I flinched and thought, What is happening As to the veracity of these claims, it should be noted that Laaksonen didnt seek the tabloid out. IltaSanomat, the second largest paper in the country according to Wikipedia , reached out to Finnish women who had encountered Trump and thats how they discovered her story. In case youre not already grimacing, the former Miss Finland added, Somebody told me there that Trump liked me because I looked like Melania when she was younger. Trump has been caught on tape saying women expire at the age of 35. Melania Trump is now 46, so she would have been expired when this alleged groping incident took place in 2006. New York Magazine has an exhaustive list of allegations made by women against Donald Trump. Donald Trump is on tape bragging about grabbing women by their pssy against their will, so its not a stretch to hear that he did indeed do this to women who are also willing to come forward and face the wrath of the Trump machine. What should be alarming is that Donald Trump is the best of the best on the Republican bench. I mean, that is supposed to be how this works, right A group of top contenders are picked for possible nomination and the best gets it. Republicans try to say this is just locker room talk, but if then Senator Barack Obama had had a bus tape like Trumps, let alone 12 women accusing him of doing what he bragged about doing, he not only wouldnt be in office right now  he wouldnt have been a contender.

"By Jason Easley on Thu, Oct 27th, 2016 at 218 pm Donald Trump promised that he would bring millions of new Republicans voters into the election, but polling in swing states shows that it is Hillary Clinton who is getting new voters out to support her.   Donald Trump promised that he would bring millions of new Republicans voters into the election, but polling in swing states shows that it is Hillary Clinton who is getting new voters out to support her. Within their discussion of a new Pennsylvania poll showing Clinton leading Trump by 7 points, The New York Times reported Mrs. Clinton has an 18point lead among voters who did not participate in the 2012 election, according to our estimates, which are based on a combination of the poll results and voter file data. She fares even better among white voters who didnt vote in 2012 than she does among white voters who did. Its a pattern that has been true across all of the Upshot/Siena surveys in Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. There has not been an influx of new voters who might help Mr. Trump. According to our estimates, Mrs. Clinton has a 16point lead among newly registered voters. The idea that Trump was bringing millions of new voters to the Republican Party was always a myth. Donald Trump got the most votes of any candidate in a Republican presidential primary. Trump also set the record for most votes cast against in a Republican primary. Trump is one of the few nominees in history to have a majority of his partys primary ballots cast against him. Hillary Clinton is the candidate who is attracting millions of new voters, and without a doubt, some of those voters have been motivated by Donald Trumps campaign. Trump was right. He has brought millions of new voters to the polls. What he neglected to tell Republicans is that they are coming for Hillary Clinton.",bias

The question is, what took them so long Trump has already had an effect on the Religious Right, an unrepentant sinner who represents everything they claim to oppose. He has 70 percent support from Evangelical men, but while Evangelical women seem to support him despite his misogyny, there are good reasons to suspect the men support him because of his negative attitude towards women.

However he feels personally about this operation, he should be encouraging our efforts publicly, rather than disparaging them. . While Trump appears not to understand basic military activities, its not clear to me that hes interested in learning them, either. Because there are a number of experts, who I thinkwould advise him otherwise. But he seems to be confident in his knowledge. And that knowledge, I think, reveals a lot about what he doesnt know. . This kind of rhetoric this kind of disrespect for our military leadership this absence of support for our troops who are actually in combat and support for our allies who are fighting and dying every day  it means to me that this individual is not qualified to be CommanderinChief. Military experts, like Gen. Allen, feel compelled to criticize the Republican nominee days before a presidential election because they feel like he is not supporting the troops and would be a danger to national security as commander in chief. Thanks to Donald Trump, the Republican Party has become the party that doesnt support the troops. Republicans have gone from real America to unAmerican in record time. If a presidential nominee doesnt respect the men and women who risk their lives for the country, then he definitely wont respect the needs of hard working Americans. With each word that comes out of his mouth, Trump continues to show America the real face of the Republican Party.",bias

This time, though, he put up a new defense strategy, at least when it comes to this particular issue  blame the microphone. When asked by OReilly if he thinks he would be winning the election if not for the release of the video, Trump once again repeated that it was only locker room talk, and then started complaining that a microphone shouldnt have been allowed to capture his comments. Shockingly, he did not express any regrets for his language. Video  Sean Colarossi @SeanColarossi October 28, 2016 It was locker room talk. The microphone was not supposed to be on  it was an illegal act that was NBC. It was not supposed to be on that was a private dressing room. Its amazing how often a microphone can be the root of a presidential candidates troubles. It should also be noted that Trumps complaint about his dressing room privacy being breached is particularly rich given his history of storming into the dressing rooms of teenage pageant contestants, some as young as 15 years old. When asked by OReilly if he would take legal action against NBCs role in uncovering and releasing the tape, Trump said, Youll see. All of this comes after Trump recently promised to sue the growing number of women who have come forward saying that they were sexually assaulted by him. Trump also spent an absurd amount of time in the interview complaining that the media is rigged not true, voter fraud is widespread false, and the polls are dirty theyre not.

"Gravis Clinton 1 LA Times Tied Overall, the Democratic nominee is beating Trump by an average of 5.4 points with just 12 days to go  and as millions of Americans have already cast their ballots. On the Electoral College front, RealClearPolitics shows that Clinton is ahead in states that total 333 electoral votes. One of the states she leads in is Arizona  a red state before Republicans nominated Trump. To put things in perspective, Barack Obama was leading Mitt Romney by just a single percentage point on this day in 2012. That is what you call a close presidential contest, and Obama still went on to easily win. Yet, as I write, CNN and other cable news networks continue to plaster the close race chyron all over their networks, claiming Donald Trump is making it a race again. Heres the thing the contest between Clinton and Trump may be naturally tightening in a few polls, but that doesnt mean its becoming a close race. Its clear that, despite any one poll showing Trump gaining ground, Clinton still has a pretty durable lead.  @FiveThirtyEight tackles question everyone is asking Is the Presidential race tightening Answer Not by much. https//t.co/XoMxzleajd pic.twitter.com/Gq5O47rNsv  Jim Roberts @nycjim October 26, 2016 While the media looks silly for trying to make the ClintonTrump race seem like a nailbiter for the ages, there is also some good that can come of it  besides high TV ratings. Clinton supporters who may have previously assumed the race was in the bag for their candidate and were becoming complacent now may recognize, at least if they watch cable news, that the race is becoming close again.

"By Hrafnkell Haraldsson on Fri, Oct 28th, 2016 at 919 am With the election just 10 days away, Trump has only donated just 56m of the 100m he promised and wont even invest in his own campaign Share on Twitter Print This Post You have got to wonder if the Trump campaign wishes it had spent less on hats and more on polling now, as it is revealed they had only 16M left in their war chest on October 19 compared to Clintons 62M. Probably not. There are always others to blame and Trumps list of those plotting against him grows in inverse proportion to his polling numbers. From June 2015 through September 2016, the Trump campaign, meaning Donald Trump, spent 3.2m on hats according to FEC filings . They spent just 1.8m on polling. Unsurprisingly, they are behind on polling, leading in precisely ZERO 0 polls . You want to win an election You need sweet hats Abraham Lincoln Trump has spent more on hats than direct mail or polling pic.twitter.com/4TOf5DQ1MQ  Jack Minor Jr. @jackminorjr October 26, 2016 And now Clinton has four times the cash. And The Washington Post is reporting that in the first 19 days of October, Trump only raised half as much as Clinton according to campaign finance reports. His biggest day was the 11.5 million he brought in on the day his sex assault tape was released, which tells you all you need to know about his base. Remember when Trump claimed he would give 100m of his own money to his campaign Yeah, this is a guy who wont even buy his own autographed sports memorabilia. He uses other peoples money for that. With the election just 10 days away, he has only donated 56m. Make what you will of this, but he had been giving 2m a month to his campaign. In the first 19 days of October Just 31k in inkind contributions. Thats right even Trump wont invest in his own campaign at this point. Trump pulled in 61m up to October 19, down from 100m in September. Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign has pulled in a cool 101m in that same period. She spent less than normal, 54m, but that leaves her a war chest of 153m going into the final stretch. Donald Trump says he is a great businessman, yet he has spent twice as much on collateral including hats as he has on paying his staff. He says he gets only the best people. And he bought a lot of his #MAGA hats. His campaign site only sells 18 different styles of hat at 20 to 30 apiece. And according to Huffington Post , The October 15 Federal Election Commission filing for Trump Make America Great Again Committee shows Trump spent 300k of donors money to buy his own book  presumably The Art of the Deal. He profited personally by doing this by way of royalty payments, and then turned around and resold autographed copies of the 22 book at 184 each. His campaign pays him to rent his own campaign headquarters, yet Trump told a crowd in Geneva, Ohio that Hillary Clinton has never earned an honest dollar, well I think thats really, you know Trump is probably the first presidential nominee to try to win the White House while turning a personal profit. Now it looks as though Trump has seen a point of diminishing returns. He not only did not selffund his campaign as promised, he has barely spent half of what he said he would spend, down to almost nothing at all as defeat looms and the potential for profit evaporates.

"By Jason Easley on Fri, Oct 28th, 2016 at 1057 am It is a cruel reality of American electoral politics that the losers of presidential campaigns get banished from national discourse, and that process has already begun for Donald Trump. Share on Twitter Print This Post It is a cruel reality of American electoral politics that the losers of presidential campaigns get banished from national discourse, and that process has already begun for Donald Trump. Despite the fact that Trump has been claiming that the presidential election is going to be rigged, stolen, or unfair, his cries are beginning to fall on deaf ears. The latest Washington Post tracking poll found that confidence that votes will be counted correctly grew by 12 points from 3143. The number of respondents who believed that voter fraud occurs somewhat often has dropped from 4737, and those expressing concerns that all votes will be counted accurately dropped from 34 to 28. Even Trump supporters are split 5049 on whether or not votes will be counted accurately. Part of the shift is likely due to the effective job that President Obama did in addressing these concerns, but it is most likely that voters are treating Trump like the candidate who is going to lose the election. One of the best indicators of a presidential elections outcome as election day draws near is the question of who voters think will win. Hillary Clinton is dominant on the question of who voters believe will win the election, which is a hint of the way that people are voting. The process of tuning out the losing candidate has a long history in the US two party system. Losing candidates who refuse to go away, like Sarah Palin, are viewed as annoying relics who refuse to acknowledge that their time is up. Trumps fifteen minutes of fame on the national stage appear to be coming to an end. His words can still poison and damage our country at a cultural level, which is why he still needs to be discussed, but as far as changing minds and winning an election, it looks voters are in the process of banishing Trump from the political island.",bias
"The Washington Post reported  Donald Trump raised just 29 million for his presidential campaign committee in the first 19 days of October, about half as much as his Democratic rival, putting him at a severe financial disadvantage in the crucial final days of the White House contest, new campaign finance reports filed Thursday night showed. The GOP presidential nominee had just 16 million left in his campaign coffers on Oct. 19, compared to Hillary Clintons 62 million. When the cash reserves of their joint fundraising committees are included, Clintons war chest grew to 153 million, while Trumps totaled 68 million. Trumps total fundraising dropped 39 in the first 19 days of October. 29 million is close to nothing for a national presidential campaign in the closing weeks of the race. At a time when Trump needs boots on the ground to get out the Republican vote, his presidential campaign is broke, and in debt to the tune of 2 million. There isnt going to be a lastminute ad blitz for Trump, or a reservation of television time so that the Republican nominee can speak directly to voters before election day. The plan for Trump is for the campaign to continue to limp along with lots of rallies, which are good for Trumps ego, but not effective in getting voters to the polls. Trump promised to donate 100 million to his campaign but has only given 56 million . The billionaire who promised to selffinance has run his presidential campaign into the ground. Trump took ten times more money out of his campaign in reimbursements to his own businesses than he gave in October. Fundraising is an indicator of expected election outcomes. The money tends to go towards the winner at the end of an election. Hillary Clinton is having no trouble raising money, which suggests that enthusiasm is high among her supporters. Trumps cash crush points to a depressed base that doesnt expect him to win. Trump has done what he does best. He talked a big game while bankrupting the Republican Party for his own personal gain. Convincing Republicans to give him their nomination may go down in history as Trumps biggest con of all.",bias

The people who arent Republicans in this election dont care about her emails. When compared to Trump sexually assaulting women, not paying federal income taxes, and being sued in two states for fraud, the emails seem like a quaint political scandal from a much simpler time. There has also never been a shred of proof that Hillary Clinton did anything wrong. Republicans cant get past the basic hurdle of needing actual evidence to back up their email conspiracy. Hillary Clinton is facing Donald Trump in this election, and only a moron or a truly desperate campaign manager clinging on the last bit of hope that she can find would believe that the reopening of an email investigation will make a bit of difference on election day.

The letter FBI Director Comey reads like what it is, an update on an investigation. The FBI is dotting the Is and crossing the Ts. Comeys letter destroys the Republican claim that there was a conspiracy to cover up Clintons emails. Republicans, including Donald Trump, have spent months criticizing Comeys investigation, but it turns out that they were wrong. It would take something unprecedented and dramatic to change the FBIs original findings. Director Comey made it clear that the agencys work might not be completed before the election. The email story that Republicans and the media love, but voters have never cared about is back in the news, but it remains an empty scandal.

The fact that Clinton will be in usually reliably red Arizona in November during the final week of the presidential campaign tells voters all they need to know about the state of the presidential race. Hillary Clinton is in such a good position that she can afford to spend some time during the last week of the campaign trying to turn red states blue. The Trump campaign already deployed VP nominee Mike Pence to Utah in a bid to save that dark red state from falling, and it looks like they will have to devote resources to saving Arizona to prevent Clinton from winning a state that has been a given for Republicans in previous elections. The Trump campaign is broke. The nominee had to give his campaign 10 million so that they could afford to buy air time in battleground states for their ads.

"A PPP poll of Florida found Candidates who have been vocal in their support for gun violence prevention perform well in Florida.

The poll was conducted by PPP the Americans for Responsible Solutions PAC, and it illustrates the dilemma that the Florida Senate race has created for Democrats. Democratic leadership is divided on spending more money on expensive Florida media, but there are polls that suggest that Sen. Marco Rubios Democratic challenger, Rep. Patrick Murphy, has a chance of winning the seat. If Rep. Murphy can beat Sen. Rubio, the defeat would likely put an end to Rubios national political career or at least force the Florida Republican to put the brakes on his plan to run for president in 2020, and instead focus on a run for governor. Democrats have a real chance to send Marco Rubio to the unemployment line.

Share on Twitter Print This Post Donald Trumps message that everything in the U.S. is crap and we are all drowning in economic hardship that only Trump can fix got slapped down today as the U.S. economy roars back. The advance estimate of GDP for the third quarter of 2016 showed that the Obama economy grew at an annual rate of 2.9. The conservative Wall Street Journal headlined this news with, U.S. Economy Roars Back, Grew 2.9 in Third Quarter. Jason Furman, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, summarized the numbers, Real GDP grew 2.9 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter, with strong export growth and continued strength in consumer spending. This news flies in the face of Donald Trumps basic economic message of doom and gloom that only he can fix. The Trump economic plan creates at least 25 million jobs, boosts growth up to 4 percent, and is revenue neutral, Trumps website claims. Before these numbers, Trumps previous problem was that Trumps economic plan is a big giveaway to the top one percent, isnt revenue neutral and would destroy 11 million jobs. Trump also struggled with analysis that his plan could hurt the economy in the long run. The conservativeleaning Tax Foundation found that Trumps plan would cost the US trillions of dollars and grow the incomes of the top one percent by 1016. Trumps tax plan could cost the U.S. 11 million jobs. According to a report released at the end of July by Moodys Analytics, Hillary Clintons economic proposals would create millions of jobs and boost economic growth higher than current projections. The analysis shows that, if implemented, the Democratic nominees agenda would create 10.4 million jobs and accelerate economic growth to an annual average of 2.7 percent. Under Trumps plan, Moodys estimated that unemployment would spike to 7 percent and over 3 million Americans would be put out of work. The U.S. economy will weaken significantly if Mr. Trumps economic policies are fully implemented as he has proposed, the June report said. The economy will suffer a recession that begins in early 2018 and extends into 2020even longer than the Great Recession. Yikes. Trump sells these plans with a broadly negative message that often strays from facts. Trump earned a Pants on Fire from PolitiFact for this claim made June 16th, 2015 in his presidential announcement speech, The last quarter, it was just announced, our gross domestic product  was below zero. Who ever heard of this Its never below zero. But also they note, Finally, since Trump was attacking Obama for this bad quarter of growth, well just throw this out Of the 42 quarters of negative growth since World War II, 30 occurred under Republican presidents and just 12 under Democratic presidents. Todays new economic numbers help Clinton make the argument that people should vote for her if they want to continue the record setting job growth numbers and economic growth under President Obama. Hillary for America Senior Policy Advisor Jacob Leibenluft pounced on the numbers to say, Todays GDP release shows economic growth at its fastest pace in two years But Hillary Clinton believes there is still more we need to do to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. Independent experts agree her plan would create goodpaying jobs through investments in infrastructure, innovation and education. The economy is roaring back under President Obama, and the numbers suggest that it does better under a Democratic president. Donald Trump keeps saying Clinton is 4 more years of Obama, which makes a sunny case for her. Trump is already struggling with just 11 days to go until the election on November 8th, and these numbers just added more weight to his uphill battle.

Share on Twitter Print This Post We have a protester By the way, were you paid 15,000 to be a thug Republican nominee Donald Trump yelled at a black man from his lectern during a rally Wednesday evening in Kinston, North Carolina. Trump went on suggesting that the man had been paid by Hillary Clinton to protest Trump. But it turns out, as usual, Trumps paranoia got the best of him and he kicked out his own supporter, a man named C.J. Cary who happened to be wearing a GOP badge and holding a letter supporting Trump but urging him to stop being so offensive. Watch here via Raleighs News  Observer The News and Observer reported, Cary says he wanted to deliver a note to Trump urging him to be less offensive and more inclusive to four demographic groups black people, women, people with disabilities and college students. Cary, an AfricanAmerican, says hes an exMarine who also worked in Afghanistan as a civilian for the U.S. Army. The irony is no doubt lost on the Trump crowd that this man came to urge Trump to be more inclusive of African Americans and he got called a paid thug and kicked out. So the answer to his plea seems to be, Never gonna happen. Cary was wearing a GOP badge and his letter slammed Hillary Clinton and President Obama. Leave it to Donald to shrink his own tent even more. It wasnt enough that he tossed out a baby, now hes going after his few minority supporters. Some things never change.",bias

Share on Twitter Print This Post Hillary Clinton did a quick presser in Iowa to respond to questions about the FBI Director James Comeys decision to appear to violate the Hatch Act 11 by participating in political activities 11 days before an election. Secretary Clinton put pressure on Comey to explain himself saying, Weve heard these rumors, we dont know what to believe.

Watch here Video Hillary Clinton calls on FBI to release all of the info it has  explain the issue in question without delay https//t.co/rg57U1RqPf  Bradd Jaffy @BraddJaffy October 28, 2016 The American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately. The director himself has said he doesnt know if the emails referenced in his letter are significant or not, the Democratic nominee said. Thats why its incumbent on the FBI to tell us what theyre talking about, Clinton said. Clinton pushed for more information to be released without delay. She said she found about the investigation from reports and that she wasnt given advance notice. Clinton said she had not been contacted by Comey on this issue. When asked what she would tell voters about her emails, Clinton responded, I think people made up their minds a while ago about the emails. This might be the right place to mention the 22 million emails the Bush administration lost and the private RNC servers they used, as context for how important this issue really is to Republicans as a value. Kristen Welker asked if Clinton was afraid that this could sink her campaign, to which Secretary Clinton responded with a big laugh Are you worried this could sink your campaign, Secretary Clinton, a reporter shouts as HRC walks out. Clinton only lets out a big laugh.  Ruby Cramer @rubycramer October 28, 2016 The Republican FBI Director James Comey wrote the House on Friday to inform hopeful Republicans that they had found new emails relating to Clintons private email that begged further investigation. It turns out the emails didnt come from Clintons server and there doesnt seem to be any there there, except for giving Republicans a reason their base needs to get out to vote. Federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the Hatch Act, and this is why a complaint has already been lodged against Comey . Hillary Clinton laughed because what else is she supposed to do at this point. How many years on is this Republicans have mined this hopeful scandal for so long its DOA. The press has followed Republicans lead with the absurd email story a story as ridiculous as it is common, and a story that was never a story until Clinton did it. Republicans and some in the press think this might sink the Clinton campaign. So they think America would rather put Putins puppet who laughs about sexually assaulting women in the White House than someone whose emails weve all read now and found nothing much but gossip. Yeah, I dont think so. Dead story was dead before it started, but that wont stop it from being spun into blood match.",bias
"By Jason Easley on Fri, Oct 28th, 2016 at 636 pm The reason why the Clinton email scandal is getting pushed 11 days before the election has nothing to with Trumps DOA White House bid, and everything to do with helping Republicans keep control of Congress. Share on Twitter Print This Post The reason why the Clinton email scandal is getting pushed 11 days before the election has nothing to with Trumps DOA White House bid, and everything to do with helping Republicans keep control of Congress. On the surface, the sudden revival of Hillary Clintons emails looks like an October surprise designed to help Republican nominee Donald Trump. The problem with this theory is that both Democrats and Republicans acknowledge that Trump is toast. Unless Hillary Clintons emails say, LOL. I was the shooter on the grassy knoll, there is nothing that would stop her from winning the election. In fact, the emails FBI Director was investigating did not come from Clinton or her server. They seem to have very little to do with Hillary Clinton or her presidential campaign. The emails are like catnip to Republican voters, who have been promised for years that if they keep sending Republicans to Congress, theyll bring down a Democratic president, and that is the real reason behind the email scandal revival. For the next ten days, Republican Congressional candidates are going to be able to campaign on investigating Hillary Clinton. The Republican candidates can pretend like Trump doesnt exist because their new pitch to voters is, Vote for me and Ill bring down Hillary. Donald Trump is a lost cause. Millions of ballots have already been cast in swing states. Trump is being out organized and trounced by Clinton on the ground. To understand the real value of the email scandal to the Republican Party, look down the ballot. The Hillary Clinton email scandal is nothing more Republican get out the vote operation to save their majorities in Congress.",bias
"A complaint has been filed against FBI Director James Comey with Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility that accuses him of interfering in a presidential election. The Democratic Coalition Against Trump released a statement announcing their complaint The Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed a complaint with the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility on Friday against FBI Director James Comey for interfering in the Presidential election, following the FBIs decision to open up an investigation into Secretary Clintons emails this close to Election Day. Federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the Hatch Act. It is absolutely absurd that FBI Director Comey would support Donald Trump like this with only 11 days to go before the election, said Scott Dworkin, Senior Advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump. It is an obvious attack from a lifelong Republican who used to serve in the Bush White House, just to undermine her campaign. Comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting America, not investigating our soon to be PresidentElect Hillary Clinton. Outrage is growing over Comeys actions as details about the FBI investigation have revealed that it has nothing to do with Clinton, her emails, or her server. Director Comeys motives for sending the letter 11 days before a presidential election have been questioned by both Republicans and Democrats. If Comeys actions were politically motivated, he would be in violation of the Hatch Act. What Republicans initially viewed as a new hope in the presidential election has quickly been exposed as a desperately political ploy. The American people deserve a full explanation from Director Comey, because the letter that was released today raises more questions than answers.",bias

Share on Twitter Print This Post Former DOJ spokesman for Eric Holder Matthew Miller, a self described recovering flack from DOJ, DSCC, schooled Republican FBI Director James Comey for violating his power and lambasted him for commenting on a case within 60 days of an election. The department and the FBI have very strict rules about when they can comment on ongoing cases and Director Comey has violated those rules going back to his original press conference when he closed the case, Miller said on CNN. But this latest example violates a long standing practice which is that the department goes out of its way not to do anything that can be seen as trying to influence an election in the closing days of an election, and usually they interpret the closing days to be seen as the last 60 days let alone the last 11 days. Watch here Miller also held school on Twitter about Comeys abuse of power, which has led to Hillary Clinton having to defend against a negative I wrote a piece in July on why Comeys public comments about Clinton were such an inappropriate abuse of power. 1/ https//t.co/G8croz4qWZ  Matthew Miller @matthewamiller October 28, 2016 He flagrantly violated DOJ rules with his press conference. Then went on to break new ground discussing details of the case to Congress2/  Matthew Miller @matthewamiller October 28, 2016 Followed by quickly releasing FBI 302s, something they rarely do, and which I doubt they will do for future highprofile cases. 3/  Matthew Miller @matthewamiller October 28, 2016 Each time, he either violated or seriously stretched DOJ rule  precedent. Press conference was the original sin,  it begat the rest. 4/  Matthew Miller @matthewamiller October 28, 2016 But todays disclosure might be worst abuse yet. DOJ goes out of its way to avoid publicly discussing investigations close to election. 5/  Matthew Miller @matthewamiller October 28, 2016 Not just public discussion either. Often wont send subpoenas or take other steps that might leak until after an election is over6/  Matthew Miller @matthewamiller October 28, 2016 Why Because voters have no way to interpret FBI/DOJ activity in a neutral way. Who is the target of an investigation What conduct 7/  Matthew Miller @matthewamiller October 28, 2016 This might be totally benign  not even involve Clinton. But no way for press or voters to know that. Easy for opponent to make hay over. 8/  Matthew Miller @matthewamiller October 28, 2016 Which takes us back to the original rule you dont comment on ongoing investigations. Then multiply that times ten close to an election. 9/  Matthew Miller @matthewamiller October 28, 2016 For whatever reason  there are many theories, Comey continues to ignore that. But only for Clinton. 10/  Matthew Miller @matthewamiller October 28, 2016 FBI is undoubtedly investigating links between the Russian hack, Manafort,  the Trump campaign. But arent commenting on it. Good 11/  Matthew Miller @matthewamiller October 28, 2016 Miller points out, This just smells worse and worse the more we learn, linking to this Emails were not to or from Clinton and appeared like info FBI already had. WTF https//t.co/YS6jWfwGzi  Ken Gude @KenGude October 29, 2016 The problem with Comeys actions isnt that he is investigating Hillary Clinton the problem is he is violating long standing rules that prohibit federal employees from doing anything that could be seen as political near an election. It is an established rule that ongoing investigations arent commented on for obvious reasons. This is quite simply not done. Comeys reasons for doing this are unclear, and perhaps when he provides more information his decision will make more sense. But its troubling that we are seeing such a consistent breakdown of tradition and rules/agreements of law surrounding the Trump campaign, which seems to have lowered the bar all around.

Share on Twitter Print This Post Earlier this week Friday Fox Follies , under the assumption the explosive , and bizarre battle between Megyn Kelly and Newt Gingrich, would be this weeks lede , I had already tricked up an opening paragraph. In case you missed it , thats when he got personal , accused her of being obsessed by sex and she told him that he should work on his anger issues . This weeks column would have been about how the Fox audience continues to splinter as they take sides in the presidential election. The NYT calls em Megyn Moments  I call them fissures in what had been assumed to be the bedrock foundation of the Fox News Channel its unthinking audience. Then came word that Rupert Murdoch was playing hardball as Kellys contract negotiations break out into the open. That paragraph, lovingly crafted, went out the window. But, lets see what this fight was about because heat is always better than light for ratings, as Trump Congratulates Newt Gingrich For Getting His Butt Kicked By Megyn Kelly . Watch As Kelly garners headlines for her feminism or lack thereof , Rupert Murdoch seems desperate to keep her. Her contract expires next year and Rupie opened up to the Wall Street Journal  of which he is owner  to partially cajole Kelly and partially to threaten her into extending her contract. Million in Contract Talks With Fox News If they are going to make a network that is going to be a postAiles/postTrump, it will be around Megyn Kelly, Chris Wallace and Shep Smith, and they are going to have to throw Hannity and OReilly overboard, said Andrew Tyndall, a televisionnews consultant, of other hosts at the network. That isnt going to happen, promised Mr. Murdoch. Were not changing directionthat would be business suicide, he said. Mr. OReillys contract is also up at the end of next year, and Mr. Murdoch said, were going to want Bill to stay with us. Mr. Hannitys contract isnt up until 2020. Ms. Kelly has forged close ties to Mr. Murdochs sons, particularly Lachlan Murdoch, who is coexecutive chairman of Fox and has taken an active role in contract talks, people close to the situation said. Fox would like to settle this before the election and before Kellys book is released, both of which could only strengthen her position in the negotiations if all goes well. From the The Power of Megyn Kellys FeminismEven if She Doesnt Call It That , by The Daily Beasts Tim Teeman  Imagine, then, her mix of satisfaction and maybe ennui as she scrolled across some of the praiseridden screeds out today How Megyn Kelly Became an Improbable Feminist Icon Vanity Fair Megyn Kelly Has Become The Biggest Example of White Feminism At Work Pajiba and Aw CrapHeres Proof That Megyn Kelly Is Kind of a Feminist Role Model Now The Stir. Note the grudging headlines. Because of Kellys employer, and because she has not fought the good feminist fight in a conventional, leftwing context throughout her career to date, the Fword mantle is being conferred upon her with something of a scowl. This, in itself, reveals a kind of blinkeredness on the part of Kellys critics It is perfectly possible to work for a rightfacing institution and not be 100 percent right wing yourself, or spout the prevailing dogma of the TV station you work for. Full disclosure I worked for The Times of London, a British, Rupert Murdochowned newspaper, for over 13 years. Aside from the fact that when she tilts Right, she tends to tilt altright, the biggest knock on Kelly is that shes too hardedged. Marshall McLuhan spoke of the Medium Cool of tee vee, but Kelly comes across as the opposite of warm and fuzzy . This makes her less attractive to other networks. Shes hoping to change that impression when she cohosts Live with Kelly Ripa The Kelly  Kelly Show the morning after the election . Think of her as a designated hitter, trying to knock Murdochs hardball right out of the park. STILL WATTERS STILL A few weeks back FFF reported on a racist Watters World in which the White Privileged PencilNecked Geek made fun of Asians. This week Asian American groups meet with Fox News personnel over awful Jesse Watters segment  Paul Cheung, president of AAJA, told the Erik Wemple Blog that the meeting was productive. I think they heard what the communitys reactions are, he said of the session at New Yorks Museum of Chinese in America. Approximately 130 Asian American groups and allies have signed an open letter to Fox News regarding the unfortunate episode, said Cheung. Ron Kim, a New York state assemblyman in attendance, told this blog that a representative from The OReilly Factor and a senior representative from the news side of the channel attended the meeting. Together they played a good cop, bad cop routine, said Kim. The gentleman from OReillys show was defending what they were doing and trying to explain that this is a part of the opinion section of Fox News and sometimes edgy humor can go too far, said Kim. Once again, the specter of Fox Newss vaunted newsopinion divide presents itself. As weve noted before, this is a convention borrowed from the newspaper industry to justify Fox News hosts such as Sean Hannity openly campaigning for Donald Trump, Steve Doocy of the morning show Fox  Friends spreading harmful innuendo into the public square  and OReilly allowing his protege to spread racist stereotypes all about Chinatown.",bias
"By Hrafnkell Haraldsson on Sat, Oct 29th, 2016 at 756 am If she gets elected on November 8th, this isnt going away. So what needs to happen, special prosecutor She cant investigate herself as the presidentelect   President Barack Obama did not have to do anything wrong for Republicans to want to throw him in jail, or to impeach him. Hillary Clinton doesnt have to have done anything wrong either, apparently, for Congress to appoint a special prosecutor to take her down once elected  because a bunch of emails had nothing to do with her . At least, that and completely ignoring the facts, was the theme on Fox News last night, though to be fair, other mainstream media outlets werent much better yesterday. Megyn Kelly, fresh from a stint of pretending to be a feminist in a faceoff with Newt Gingrich, suggested to Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Bob Goodlatte RWV that given the FBI revelations of a complete lack of evidence that Hillary Clinton has done anything wrong, what needs to happen is a special prosecutor. MEGYN KELLY  Let me ask you this. If she gets elected on November 8th, this isnt going away. So what needs to happen, a special prosecutor She cant investigate herself as the presidentelect. BOB GOODLATTE  Well, first of all, we have said from the outset that the House Judiciary Committee would follow the truth wherever it leads, and we have done that throughout the summer, asking a number of questions about how this investigation by the FBI was being conducted. We will continue to do that. We dont know whats going to happen now. We dont know whats going to happen after the election. So its pure speculation what will happen afterwards. A special prosecutor, remember, is appointed by the Attorney General of the United States. So, you have to decide whether thats going to be a fairer investigation than the one being conducted by the FBI under the direction of Director Comey right now. And the Judiciary Committee will certainly stay engaged in this and continue our investigation. Democracy is a fragile thing. It is to Goodlattes credit that he declined the call to draw up articles of impeachment in 2014 and that he cautioned Megyn Kelly that a special prosecutor is appointed not by the House but by the Attorney General. However, the GOPled House has been far too engaged already in undermining our democracy. What holds this country together is an idea and an agreement among all parties that it works. Republicans have decided it only works if theyre in charge, and this has brought us to the point where we threaten to jail our adversaries, appoint special prosecutors if they win, or vote to impeach them outright, as Trumps pet snake at CNN, Jeffrey Lord, called for last night  Two points, Anderson. One, with 11 days left, this makes Donald Trumps argument exactly to the point here, you sum up the argument in terms of her judgment, her paranoia and all of the rest. The second thing, Anderson is, and this is the really disturbing thing, lets just say for the sake of the argument she wins the election, this isnt going to stop. There will be a move to impeach her the moment her hand comes down from that Bible. This is going to go on and on and on and on and frankly, I mean thats something the American people need to consider now. It is not difficult to see where this will lead. Hillary Clinton has committed no crimes. Far from being a miscarriage of justice, though it is that as well, this is a miscarriage of reason and sanity. This sort of talk is just further evidence that Donald Trump comes from the same vile brew as Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and the rest of the party. During the McCarthy era, the House took it upon itself to be both judge and jury. Last night, it was Fox News egging the House on for more of the same. This sort of talk is deplorable, it is reprehensible, and it is dangerous  and strikes at the very heart of our democracy.",bias

This is the result of the press, once again, taking Republican smoke and claiming theres fire. This observation isnt mine along. The Washington Posts Greg Sargent pointed out that there is only an upside and no penalty for doing this  for both Republicans and the press This is how GOP hypeaheadofthefacts gets rewarded by medias willful perpetuation of smoke/fire effect. Zero penalty. Only upside. https//t.co/vm0ZLTrACL  Greg Sargent @ThePlumLineGS October 29, 2016 Even though early polling shows there hasnt been an impact in swing states , and even though the majority of Americans have already made up their minds, each time her emails are brought up Hillary Clinton falls in the polls. A Gallup poll showed that emails are the most Americans have heard about Clinton. Not that she is the most qualified candidate in modern history or how her policy on paid family leave might impact them  but the emails that she was already cleared on. Even though one result of the Comey letter has been to energize Clinton supporters , at a time when she was facing a likely win that can create complacency, this still isnt an acceptable practice. Republican FBI Director James Comey finds himself in the hot seat today after sending a letter that has no precedent, obviously would impact an election that was then just 11 days out and is now 10 days out, and actually bore no information well, thats inaccurate. The letter bore inaccurate smoke and innuendo that has already been cleared, but the damage has already been done. While Ron Fournier and others suggested that Democratic objections to this unprecedented violation of the rules by Comey was just more partisan folly, the truth is even more disturbing. By even suggesting that objecting to violating a longstanding rule is partisan, we are allowing the press to enable Republicans to continue pretending there is no reality. In reality, no matter which side of the aisle you are on, its a rule not to comment on ongoing investigations that could impact an election. The reasons for this are obvious and the potential ramifications for abuse are terrifying for both parties  for instance, its obvious that the FBI is investigating the Trump campaign for coordination with Russia, but we dont headline that because the FBI hasnt commented on that, because To do so would violate the rule not to interfere with elections. So its really quite frightening to hear people claim objecting to violating this rule is partisan, even as the Trump campaign is benefiting from the adherence to said rule. If the rule applies to Donald Trump, it should apply to Hillary Clinton. Asking that this value be applied to both sides is not partisan. We must stick to reality. We must not allow our need to appear objective cause us to fall so far down the rabbit hole that we enable Republicans to keep drinking the nofact KoolAid. The press did the Republican smoke is a real fire thing all through President Obamas terms, at one point claiming he was implicated in Benghazi emails because a reporter allowed a Republican aide to read him said emails  and of course, it turned out that the emails didnt say what the aide told the reporter. But that was learned much later and as everyone knows, a lie travels faster than the truth. And now American voters in swing states who read papers will think the FBI is investigating Clinton. So Comeys letter did damage Hillary Clinton. Even if she wins the election, the letter damaged her and down ballot Democrats. The media never learns. They take Republican smoke and innuendo and treat it as fact, every time. They look like fools to those who know there was no there in the Comey letter, but the average voter doesnt live for political updates. The irresponsible damage is done.

Clinton campaign chair John Podesta called Comeys letter long on innuendo, short on facts. Podesta said the more information that comes out, the more this seems overblown. Podesta went off on Rep. Jason Chaffetz for distorting the facts and undermining his own legitimacy by claiming that the investigation was reopened. Podesta said that Comey had provided selective information that allowed partisans to distort the facts. Podesta said theres no evidence of wrongdoing, no charge of wrongdoing. He said if all the media reports are true, about the investigation having nothing to do with Hillary Clinton, its hard to see how this amounts to anything. Hillary Clintons campaign chair called on Comey to provide answers to be public. Clinton campaign manager Robbie Mook said that the Comey letter is motivating Clinton volunteers and supporters Based on the anecdotes I am hearing from out team on the ground, this situation has created an urgency and intensity among our volunteers and activists that was already high because we are so close to the election. Our volunteers are rallying around Hillary They know what a fighter she is. . They are turning out, not only to have her back but to rally our supporters to turn out and vote, as early voting goes into full swing. Were not just seeing this in our offices, on the ground, but also in our online, in the online space as well. I think this is we already had momentum and wind behind our back going into yesterday. I think that this has only increased the momentum that were feeling among our activists on the ground. Later Mook suggested that the Comey letter is helping the Clinton campaign by adding fuel to their early voting fire. It is likely that the Comey letter will backfire on Republicans and motivate Democrats to get out and support their nominee. An early report from a pollster in two swing states saw no impact from the letter on voters. Hillary Clinton may end up benefiting from Comeys actions because the FBI Director might have gotten rid of the one thing that could have beaten her.

"By Sarah Jones on Sat, Oct 29th, 2016 at 1203 pm Donald Trump uses sexual shaming and humiliation of women as simplistic revenge for the slightest felt spurn. A newly surfaced video via Ryan Grim shows the Trump Humiliation game in action, which I walk everyone through from the POV of the woman. Share on Twitter Print This Post If youre a woman whos worked in any business where youre forced to try to appease the massively sensitive ego of a sexually aggressive, vulgar man in power, you will know exactly whats about to happen in this video. Donald Trump uses sexual shaming and humiliation of women as simplistic revenge for the slightest felt spurn. And theres a newly surfaced video via Ryan Grim at Huffington Post that shows the Trump Humiliation game in action. In the video, Trump publicly sexualizes and shames the 2004 Miss Universe winner from Australia, Jennifer Hawkins as revenge. Before he does it, Trump tells the audience, Get even with people. If they screw you, screw them back 10 times as hard. I really believe that. Watch this newly surfaced 2011 corporate speech here via Huffington Post major trigger warning if youve been there Watching this you see the Trump modus operandi in action. This is the sting felt by numerous women who report spurning Trumps advances. The harassment as revenge. The sexual shaming. Trump sets the audience up for the Roman Gladiator moment of public sexual offering by priming them with his belief that you should screw people back if they screw you. The sexually angry verb foreshadows whats to come, because he is going to screw Jennifer Hawkins in public, when she realizes that because its public, she cant further humiliate him by saying no or objecting without facing huge repercussions. Trump says hes going to give them an example of his revenge theory, Jennifer Hawkins. Trump orders Hawkins to the stage. The audience cheers and jeers, delighting in the upcoming shaming of the beautiful girl. Its to be a public spanking. So much fun. First of all, how beautiful is Jennifer, Trump asks, claiming ownership of Jennifer as an object while playing magnanimous daddy who dishes out praise and approval before the spanking. The message He can make or break her. She better play nice. Warning shot, This is about getting even. Trump tells the audience that he was mad at Hawkins because she allegedly dissed him by declining to introduce him at the event in Sydney. He tells the audience how mad he was, and then says, as shes crossing the stage, Shes my favorite Miss Universe. So she thinks maybe this isnt going to be as bad as she fears. But then he stabs her publicly for the first time, But I think I like the new one better. The audience loves it. He is going to feed them the sexual humiliation of a beautiful woman because she wasnt a good girl. She reaches him and they clasp hands while she smiles through the shame knowing she has no choice and wanting to be a good sport. Hawkins tries to make light of the situation while appeasing Trump, playing along with his game because she has to, but there will be no easy way out of this one. It wont be enough to fawn over him in front of the audience. She will have to pay. I was actually going to get up and tell you that Jennifer is a beautiful girl on the outside, but shes not very bright, Trump tells the audience, signaling that Hawkins is a piece of meat to be dissected by him publicly for her refusal to give him anything he asks for. That wouldnt have been true, but I would have said it anyway, Trump proudly tells the audience. This is his alpha male routine, except in real life, the alpha male doesnt have to abuse money and power he inherited in order to win the girl. But in the mind of little men like Trump, this makes him a winner. Trump points out that Hawkins is a big star now, but he helped her make it and then dissed him. He owns her. She must comply or face his wrath. Hawkins tries to say that she did introduce him, but Trump pushes her away from the microphone. This public shaming will be done from Trumps POV only. No need for Hawkins to assert her personhood.There will be no defense allowed, because shes already guilty. And you know what She came tonight, she came  came, she came, she came, Trump says gleefully like the drunk pervy uncle everyone tries to avoid at Christmas. He waits for the audience to join him in his sexual shaming, and they do. They get it. Hee heee. So clever. Came. Knuckles dragging on the floor clever. See, so they have the same filthy minds in Australia, Trump says. Trump grabs Hawkins around the waist and forces a kiss on her, just like he bragged about doing on the Bush tape. Hawkins reflexively turns away and puts her arm between them. The kiss misses its mark and lands on her cheek. She is hoping this is good enough humiliation for him, but putting her foot down on actual mouth contact. Shes allowed herself to be publicly humiliated to appease him, and pretended to fawn over him as required, but she will not, cannot, allow the kiss. The repulsive kiss. Im telling this story as I imagine it to be from her point of view, although she has refused to comment. Of course she refused to comment, women are told they will be blackballed if they comment. The world is full of men like Trump, and they stick together. See Roger Ailes. Women have to play along and appease and if that doesnt work, they have to allow themselves to be sexually assaulted and humiliated just a little bit in public, especially if they said no in private. I can only do this because I have lived it, somewhat like this, in public. And I have tried to appease the ego of the assaulter in order to keep my job, while denying him his assumed entitlement to my body. From talking to so many women during this election, I know that Im not alone. I know that many other women will watch this and know. They will feel the creep of fear and revulsion, the deer in the headlights cringe that takes over when you know that you are about to be humiliated as a sexual object because you refused him or refused to appease the ego of the powerful man in charge by behaving like a sexual conquest. How dare Hawkins have her own life and be unwilling to change all of her plans in order to introduce Trump. And other people will watch this humiliation and enjoy it, setting you up to be humiliated even more. They will laugh about it and gossip about it, which is the social punishment women face when they reject a man like Trump. Ironically, if you give in youre not humiliated. Its only if you say no that you are set up to be publicly flogged as a sex object. Its not just the unwanted kiss, although that is disgusting and assault, much like Donald Trump bragged about doing on the Billy Bush bus tape. Its the public humiliation and denigration. Its the way the woman is forced, in front of thousands of people, to try to smile her way through his ambush of verbal and physical assaults as he takes revenge. Its the way she tries to make it okay, to sweetsmooth his ego in order to get out of the line of fire, and in return he shames her by suggesting he made her come and then grabs her for an unwanted kiss. If there is any good to come out of the total crapfest of the Trump candidacy, perhaps it is a raised awareness that women are people, and that this kind of thing is horrific but its not all Trumps fault. Its the cultures fault because it takes a willing audience to successfully publicly sexually shame a woman. In fact, this is shades of what Trump did to Hillary Clinton in the stalking debate, after which he announced that looking at her from behind he was not impressed. Neither are we by you, Mr. Trump. Neither are we.",bias
"A pollster who is in the field in two swing states is reporting that he is seeing no early impact from the FBI reviewing new emails in the Hillary Clinton investigation in two swing states. Geoff Garin of Hart Research tweeted from the field Still early, but I was in the field in two states last night and saw absolutely no impact from the reporting on the Comey letter.  Geoff Garin @geoffgarin October 29, 2016 It is still early, but if this were the election shifting news that Republicans were hoping for the impact would have been immediate. The reality is that if the public opinion polls tighten in the final days of the campaign, it will be because Republicans are coming back to Trump. There are few undecided voters in this election, and even if all the Republican base come home to Trump, it wont be enough for Trump to win, because he is losing where the presidential election is really held. Trump is getting crushed at the state level. Republicans have been trying to build Hillary Clintons emails into a story for years, and they have failed at every turn. Hillary Clinton led the election while under Congressional investigation. Hillary Clinton led the election while under FBI investigation. Hillary Clinton is leading the election today. The message that Republicans and the media dont want to hear is that voters are sick of the emails, and they dont care. Voters are smarter than Republicans and the press give them credit for. The Hillary Clinton email scandal has never broken out of the right wing bubble because there is no evidence that Clinton did anything wrong. If the polls tighten a little, this will be the best news in the world for Hillary Clinton and Democrats, because it will destroy any potential for Democratic complacency and get their voters out and to the polls. What Geoff Garin witnessed is probably going to end up being very accurate. James Comeys letter to Congress is unlikely to move swing states and change the outcome of the presidential election.",bias
"Share on Twitter Print This Post The FBI is examining how a Hillary Clinton aide handled emails. The examination has nothing to do with the Democratic nominee, her emails, or her email server. According to Newsweeks Kurt Eichenwald, the scandal is related to the process Clinton aide Huma Abedin used to print out emails for the then secretary of state to read. Eichenwald reported Because Clinton preferred to read documents on paper rather than on a screen, emails and other files were often printed out and provided to her either at her office or home, where they were delivered in a diplomatic pouch by a security agent. Abedin, like many State Department officials, found the government network technology to be cumbersome, and she had great trouble printing documents there, investigative records show. As a result, she sometimes transferred emails from her unclassified State Department account to either her Yahoo account or her account on Clintons server, and printed the emails from there. It is not clear whether she ever transferred official emails to the account she used for her husbands campaign. Abedin would use this procedure for printing documents when she received emails she believed Clinton needed to see and when the Secretary forwarded emails to her for printing. Abedin told the FBI she would often print these emails without reading them. Abedin printed a large number of emails this way, in part because, investigative records show, other staff members considered her Clintons gatekeeper and often sent Abedin electronic communications they wanted the Secretary to see. The entire scandal is about how emails were printed. It has nothing to do with how Hillary Clinton handled emails or classified information. The investigation is related to how an aide printed emails for Hillary Clinton to read. No wonder Comey didnt provide more details in his letter to Congress. The details of what is being examined are an embarrassment to the FBI. There is no evidence that Clintons aide committed a crime. For the printing of the emails to be deemed criminal, there must be evidence that Abedin intended to leak classified information. There remains zero evidence of criminal activity. The FBI examination of new emails is turning out to be one of the most overblown red herrings of the 2016 election , and Comeys behavior is a disgrace to the US intelligence community. The new information destroys Republican hopes that the new emails were the game changer that could save them from defeat . Republicans may spend the remaining days pushing the emails, but their behavior will be the hallmark of a desperate party that is facing a crushing defeat. The emails wont change anything in 2016, but they will give Congressional Republicans a reason to keep investigating Hillary Clinton in 2017 and beyond. In other words, James Comey is already delegitimizing Hillary Clintons potential presidency.",bias
"Trump warned his supporters that the US Postal Service is trying to steal the election for Hillary Clinton in Colorado. Video At a rally in Golden, CO, Trump said I have real problems with ballots being sent. Does that make sense Like people saying, Oh, heres a ballot. Heres another ballot. Throw it away. Oh, heres one I like. Well keep that one. I have real problems, so get your ballots in. Trump also accused election officials of throwing away ballots, as his rally was a mixture of claims of voter fraud and baseless speculation about Hillary Clintons emails. Donald Trump appears to be losing his mind. He also seems to think that accusing the US Postal Service and election officials of stealing the election for Hillary Clinton is going to motivate Republicans to vote. Consider the contradiction in Trumps message. The Republican nominee tells his supporters that the US Postal Service is throwing away ballots, while at the same time he is urging them to mail in their ballots. If their ballots are going to be thrown away by USPS, why should Republicans bother mailing their ballots in It is this sort of incoherent gibberish that makes no sense. Trumps inability to stay disciplined and on message is also one of the biggest reasons why Republicans on pace to lose this election. Donald Trumps descent into paranoid senior citizen continues to play out in front of the entire nation, as the Republican nominee for president believes that his letter carrier is out to get him,",bias
"By Rmuse on Sat, Oct 29th, 2016 at 323 pm He is taking the conspiracy theories and obstruction that dogged his presidency from day one and throwing them back in Republicans faces.   The following is an opinion column by R Muse Although this campaign season has been interesting, to say the least, there is something happening one never thought would occur. After spending nearly eight years demonizing, obstructing, and criticizing every and anything about the President of the United States, Republicans desperate to save their jobs are beginning to tout their  imagined  close ties to the Democratic President whose approval rating and popularity are growing. It is hypocritical, to say the least, and at some point a result of a toxic Republican candidate for the presidency, but for some GOP candidates it is a very dangerous strategy. If any Republican believed President Obama would allow them to take advantage of him after spending eight years assailing him as illegitimate and corrupt, they were sadly mistaken and underestimated the commander in chiefs tolerance during an election. The President is using the final two weeks before the election to decimate Republicans for either  belated rejection  or continued support of Donald Trump. President Obama is also reminding Republicans that  Donald Trump is the endpoint of eight years of GOP toxic hostility . It may be a tad of an exaggeration to claim that  Obama seems determined to spend the last two weeks of the election laying waste to every Republican who ever crossed him , but he is getting some wellplaced and wellwarranted shots at Republicans. Two Republican hypocrites hoping to take advantage of the Presidents approval ratings have been some of his harshest critics so it likely stunned the President that they are boasting working closely with the man they obstructed, opposed, and attempted to get rid of. Ohio Senator Rob Portman had the temerity to run a campaign ad boasting about working closely with the President to break the grip of heroin addiction. President Obama took the time to excoriate Portman for,  Finally withdrawing his support from Donald Trump , but only  After looking at the polling. Now that its politically expedient. But he has supported him up until last week So I guess it was OK when Trump was attacking minorities, and suggesting that Mexicans were rapists  and insulting Gold Star moms, making fun of disabled Americans. I guess that didnt quite tip it over the edge. Why was that OK And now he says he will vote for the vicepresidential nominee instead, except that guy still supports Donald Trump.  The President was a little more exercised after learning that the man who called the President  one of the most corrupt presidents in modern times, California Republican Representative Daryl Issa, is sending out campaign mailers with the Presidents face on them and boasting about his close work with President Obama  to protect victims of sexual assault . Daryl Issa is in a fairly competitive race compared to past elections and he certainly has earned the Presidents wrath after obstructing progress and wasting taxpayer money on Issacreated scandals. During a fundraiser in La Jolla California Sunday last, the President assailed Issa for having the audacity to use a campaign mailer with the Presidents image on it. The President said,  Issas primary contribution to the United States Congress has been to obstruct and to waste taxpayer dollars on trumpedup investigations that have led nowhere. This is now a guy who, because poll numbers are bad, has sent out brochures with my picture on them touting his cooperation on issues with me. Now that is the definition of chutzpah. As remarked by Tim Murphy at Mother Jones, President Obama is not just evening up the score with Republicans who made his tenure miserable,  He is attempting to have the last word on the personal and political fights of the last eight yearsto take the conspiracy theories and obstruction that dogged his presidency from day one and throw them back in Republicans faces . The President clearly has a lot of  words  to harangue Republicans with. He said ,  Heres the thing. For years, Republican politicians and the farright media outlets have pumped up all kinds of crazy stuff about me. About Hillary. About Harry. They said I wasnt born here. They said climate change is a hoax. They said that I was going to take everybodys guns away They said that while we were doing military exercises that weve been doing forever, suddenly this was a plot to impose martial law. This is what theyve been saying for years now So people have been hearing it they start thinking well maybe its true And if the world theyve been seeing is Im powerful enough to cause hurricanes on my own and to steal everybodys guns in the middle of the night and impose martial laweven though I cant talk without a prompterthen is it any wonder that they end up nominating somebody like Donald Trump And the fact is that there are a lot of politicians who knew better. There are a lot of senators who knew better but they went along with these stories because they figured you know what thisll help rile up the base, itll give us an excuse to obstruct what were trying to do, we wont be able to appoint judges, well gum up the works, well create gridlock, itll give us a political advantage. So they just stood by and said nothing and their base began to actually believe this stuff. So Donald Trump did not start this. Donald Trump didnt start it, he just did what he always did which is slap his name on it, take credit for it, and promote it. Thats what he always does. And so now, when suddenly its not working and people are saying wow this guys kind of out of line, all of a sudden these Republican politicians who were okay with all this crazy stuff up to a point suddenly theyre all walking away. Oh, this is too much. So when you finally get him on tape bragging about actions that qualify as sexual assault and his poll numbers go down, suddenly thats a dealbreaker. Well what took you so long What the heck What took you so long All these years The Mother Jones piece made out like President Obama is seeking retribution, or  revenge  against Republicans for their impropriety as legislators over the past eight years. Without knowing what goes on in the Presidents head to motivate his campaign rhetoric that is a hard call to make with any surety. Barack Obama does not strike one as being vindictive. The President is, though, an accomplished campaigner and as his tenure in the White House is winding down and Republicans are struggling to find an identity apart from Donald Trump, it is prudent of the President to remind voters exactly what Republicans are about and what they are about is precisely why Donald Trump is their standard bearer and why Republicans are hypocrites for both abandoning Trump and embracing the man they obstructed and tried to remove from the White House.",bias
"By Hrafnkell Haraldsson on Sat, Oct 29th, 2016 at 405 pm You do know you just attacked a Gold Star family one adviser warned Trump. Whats that he asked. Share on Twitter Print This Post Gabriel Sherman writes at New York Mag that when Donald Trump attacked the Khan family over Khizr Khans speech at the Democratic National Convention, he had no idea what a Gold Star family was. You will remember that Khizr Khan stood up in front of the entire world and said to Donald Trump, Let me ask you, Have you even read the United States Consitution I will gladly lend you my copy. In this document, look for the words liberty and equal protection of the law. The fallout was predictable. Donald Trump, openly criticized, lost it. He attacked the Khans religious beliefs, saying If you look at his wife, she was standing there. She had nothing to say. She probably, maybe she wasnt allowed to have anything to say. Now it turns out that he had no idea what he was doing. Because he is ignorant, and because, as Mark Cuban has observed, he isnt interested in learning anything. Gabriel Sherman explains You do know you just attacked a Gold Star family one adviser warned Trump. Trump didnt know what a Gold Star family was Whats that he asked. To Trump, Khizr Khan and his wife, Ghazala, were enemies who had said something mean about him, just like Rosie ODonnell and any number of people who had gotten under his skin over the years. Wasnt it his right to respond The election is about the American people, its not about you, Manafort told Trump, according to a person briefed on the conversation. Trump countered with Breitbarts report on Khans purported belief in Sharia. Hes not running for president, Manafort shot back. The Clintons did this to us to waste our time getting off message. Of course, Trump could not and would not admit his own ignorance and he certainly wasnt prepared to take the blame. Instead, as Sherman reveals, he took it out on Manafort in front of his senior advisors, including Ailes. According to Trump, Manafort wasnt able to get the media to focus on the right stuff. No wonder, when Trump refuses to take Manaforts advice and focus on the right stuff. This is not to defend Manafort, who is at least as despicable as his boss, but it serves as an example of how Trumps first reaction each and every time is to get back at his critic. It was one of Donald Trumps most visible Joe McCarthy moments, and his response to Khizr Khan actually reinforced the point Khan was trying to make. Stopping and thinking are foreign to him. And if you are not astonished by the appalling ignorance on display here, you should not be. This is all in keeping with a party that prides itself on ignorance rather than facts.",bias
"By Rmuse   757 pm If the party doesnt learn lessons and change based on whats gone on for the last year and a half, I think its going to be just catastrophic.   The following is an opinion column by R Muse It may be the understatement of the year to say the Republican Party is on the verge of a fullon civil war, and it may be obvious to many Americans that the blame for the interparty discord is its standard bearer Donald J. Trump. However much Trumps candidacy has contributed to the tensions between establishment types terrified of Trumps reckless disregard for the longevity of the party and rebellionminded Trump supporters, the real instigators are the Koch brothers. Although the oil magnates were never on the Trump bandwagon, they are responsible for the Trump loyalists within the GOP who were part of the teabagger movement intent on disrupting the nations political system and indeed, the workings of government itself. The tea party caucus, an extremist sect that succeeded in chasing former House Speaker John A. Boehner out of Congress, morphed into the inaptly named Freedom caucus that has embraced Trump are set to set fire to the party establishment and it isnt solely to put current Speaker Paul Ryan out of a job, although that is high on the Trump supporters todo list. As noted in Wednesdays New York Times,  Mr. Trumps supporters said they were determined to harness the antiestablishment energy that Mr. Trump had catalyzed and to refocus it on the Republican leadership in Congress  a target many of them seemeager to take down . The rightwing extremist that actually  took down  former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, conservative extremist and House Freedom Caucus member David Brat, issued a warning to establishment Republicans  Theres a huge chunk of people who want to see a fight taken to D.C. Leadership comes and smacks our guy Thats where youre going to put down a marker Really And the American people are just scratching their head saying, Really Thats rich . Brat has been a thorn in the establishments side since Paul Ryan became Speaker and he joins a dangerous number of  real conservatives  who cannot understand or comport with Ryan and establishment leaders who dared criticize Trump instead of using their majority advantage to go after Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump and a few of his  senior aides  are prodding extremist conservatives to revolt against the establishment leadership after the election for not defending Trump. In fact, besides assailing Ryan for not sticking by Trump, it is reported that Trump said privately that Ryan should be made to pay a heavy price for disloyalty to the Trump candidacy. And, during an interview with Reuters he complained that  The people are very angry with the leadership of this party, because this is an election that we will win, 100 percent, if we had support from the top . Win or lose, there is going to be a major bloodletting after the election and the establishment, although powerful, may face a Herculean task to save the party. This impending conflict within the GOP has been brewing longer than Donald Trump has been a candidate and it may be why he brought on an experienced antiestablishment devotee to run his campaign. The chairman of Breitbart News, Stephen Bannon, had made it one of his primary goals to get Paul Ryan out as House Speaker because he is not a true conservative intent on tearing government down to restructure it into an uberconservative paradise. And uberconservative is just a different way of saying a  nongovernment  according to the Koch brothers vision of American libertarianism. Dont believe it Two groups closely aligned with the Koch brothers, Heritage Action for America and FreedomWorks , have been pushing Republicans as a Party to adopt more extremist positions and see the civil war as a stellar opportunity to have greater influence over the partys decisions something establishment types are resisting. Over the past few days, leaders of both Koch groups joined extremist conservatives in calling to delay a vote on selecting a candidate to be the next, or new, speaker of the House something typically occurring directly after the general election in November regardless the outcome. According to the chief executive of Heritage Action, Michael Needham, there is going to be Hell to pay for establishment Republicans if they dont bend to the will of the extremist wing created by the Kochs and heavily courted by Donald Trump. Mr. Needham said,  If the party doesnt learn lessons and change based on whats gone on for the last year and a half, I think its going to be just catastrophe . Another conservative extremist, House Freedom Caucus member and ardent Donald Trump supporter echoed Needhams sentiment and said,  You cant ignore what millions and millions of people have expressed in this election cycle.  The dilemma for Republicans after the election, no matter the outcome, is maintaining a semblance of stability as a political party. That doesnt seem likely because if Trump loses, big or small, the extremists will unleash whatever level of Hell they can muster on the establishment for daring to criticize any of Trumps more outrageous and dangerous comments on the stump. If Trump wins, the extremists will be emboldened to purge the party of any disloyal establishment types and it appears that no matter what happens on November 8, it will not be the end of hostilities among Republicans. The Republican Party establishment is in for a reckoning with an extremist wing that was once content threatening the full faith and credit of the United States or shutting down the government as a show of anger. After four years of internal bickering over what it means to be a true conservative, and the past yearandahalf of incitement by Donald Trump, the Republican Party faces a serious threat to its longterm survival. It is a threat that began about six years ago when the Koch brothers ushered in an age of extremist conservatives that Donald Trump took advantage of to seize control of the Republican Party.",bias
"By Reuters   716 pm Heading into the homestretch of the presidential campaign, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton is looking to harness some celebrity star power to help get out the vote and energize volunteers in battleground states.   By Roberta Rampton DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. Reuters  Heading into the homestretch of the presidential campaign, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton is looking to harness some celebrity star power to help get out the vote and energize volunteers in battleground states. Jennifer Lopez will headline a free concert for Clinton supporters in Miami on Saturday, giving the former secretary of state a chance to connect with the key demographic of millennials she has sometimes struggled to reach  and some visual counterprogramming to the latest email controversy to roil her race for the White House. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Friday it is investigating more emails as part of a probe into Clintons use of a private email system  a latebreaking surprise that will likely continue to get extensive media play leading up to the Nov. 8 vote Celebritydriven events like the concert can serve as a bit of a distraction from the controversy, said Eric Kasper, a political scientist at the University of WisconsinEau Claire. It is a way to kind of take the edge off things because it tends to be more positive, Kasper said. The JLo concert is the first in a series. Next week, Clinton will take the stage with Jay Z in Cleveland, and then with Katy Perry in Philadelphia on Nov. 5. A Harvard University poll this week showed that among likely voters aged 18 to 29, Clinton is leading Republican rival Donald Trump, a celebrity in his own right who starred in the reality television show The Apprentice. But turnout is a concern. The exceptionally negative tone of this years race for the White House has soured young Americans on politics, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows. Presidential candidates have long sought to create buzz with help from celebrity pals, said Tevi Troy, who chronicled the strategy in his book What Jefferson Read, Ike Watched, and Obama Tweeted 200 Years of Pop Culture in the White House. Campaigns do it to reach out to people who are not necessarily interested in politics but are interested in pop culture, said Troy, a presidential historian who worked in the George W. Bush White House. The events are like a larger version of a campaign yard sign, a way to show a groundswell of support behind a candidate  and a way to appeal to fans of the musicians, said Kasper, who has studied the intersection between pop culture and politics. It can create a kind of psychological connection that we otherwise might not have when a politician endorses a presidential candidate, for instance, Kasper said.

"By Reuters   634 pm Democrat Hillary Clintons top aides on Saturday lashed out at FBI Director James Comey for igniting a new controversy over a longrunning private email investigation less than two weeks before the presidential election, saying there was no evidence of wrongdoing and accusing him of spreading innuendo.   By Roberta Rampton and Steve Holland DAYTONA BEACH, Fla./GOLDEN, Colo. Reuters  Democrat Hillary Clintons top aides on Saturday lashed out at FBI Director James Comey for igniting a new controversy over a longrunning private email investigation less than two weeks before the presidential election, saying there was no evidence of wrongdoing and accusing him of spreading innuendo. Comey, who has headed the Federal Bureau of Investigation since 2013, notified the U.S. Congress on Friday that the agency is again reviewing emails, even though in July it decided not to seek prosecution of Clinton for her handling of classified materials on a private email server while she was secretary of state. John Podesta, who heads Clintons presidential campaign, told reporters that Comeys letter to Congress was light on facts, heavy on innuendo, and he urged Comey to come forward and give those answers to the American public about the exact nature of the FBIs latest review of emails. Sources close to the investigation on Friday said the latest emails were discovered as part of a separate probe into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Weiner, a former U.S. congressman from New York, is the target of an FBI investigation into illicit text messages he is alleged to have sent to a 15yearold girl in North Carolina. With the Nov. 8 elections quickly approaching, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump pounded away at the new FBI development, devoting a large part of a campaign speech in Golden, Colorado, to attacking Clinton and arguing that she is not to be trusted with the presidency. Her criminal action was willful, deliberate, intentional and purposeful, Trump said, standing in front of hay bales stacked in a horse barn. Hillary set up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her illegal actions from public disclosure and exposure. Comey, however, has not provided any details on whether the emails now under review are being seen for the first time by the FBI or the nature of their contents. Clintons campaign tried to play down the new review. Theres no evidence of wrongdoing, no charge of wrongdoing, Podesta said, in the FBIs latest announcement that it was taking appropriate investigative steps after learning of emails that appear to be pertinent to the earlier probe. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook, trying to tamp down speculation of a voter backlash this late in the campaign, said Americans had already factored what they knew about the email investigation into how they would cast their ballots. We dont see it changing the landscape for undecided voters, Mook said. Clinton aides also said this latest controversy has further energized her supporters. Clinton was campaigning in Florida on Saturday, a battleground state that many analysts say Trump must win in order to have any chance of being elected. In recent weeks, Trump has been running behind Clinton in most public opinion polls. Justice Department officials, according to a source who asked not to be identified, were opposed to the FBI directors letter being sent to Congress and believe his actions conflict with a Justice Department memo outlining instructions that agencies should not to act in ways that could influence elections. While Attorney General Loretta Lynch did not discuss the matter directly with Comey, the source said aides were in touch with each other. Comey let it be known he felt he had to send the letter as a followup to his congressional testimony earlier this year regarding the FBIs probe of Clintons emails, the source said. Meanwhile, Clinton supporters rallied to her defense following Fridays FBI disclosure. The Congressional Black Caucus, comprised of about 45 members of the House of Representatives, nearly all Democrats, held a news conference in Columbus, Ohio, and urged Comey to release more details.

"By Reuters   551 pm Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton leads Republican Donald Trump by 15 percentage points among early voters surveyed in the past two weeks, according to the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project.   By Maurice Tamman NEW YORK Reuters  With 11 days to go before the U.S. presidential election, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton leads Republican Donald Trump by 15 percentage points among early voters surveyed in the past two weeks, according to the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project. Though data is not available for all early voting states, Clinton enjoys an edge in swing states such as Ohio and Arizona and in Republican Party strongholds such as Georgia and Texas. An estimated 19 million Americans have voted so far in the election, according to the University of Floridas United States Election Project, accounting for as much as 20 percent of the electorate. Overall, Clinton remained on track to win a majority of votes in the Electoral College, the Reuters/Ipsos survey showed. Having so many ballots locked down before the Nov. 8 election is good news for the Clinton campaign. On Friday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that it is examining newly discovered emails belonging to Clintons close aide, Huma Abedin. Those emails were found on a computer belonging to Anthony Weiner, Abedins estranged husband, during an unrelated investigation into illicit messages he is alleged to have sent to a teenage girl. The Reuters/Ipsos survey was conducted before the news emerged Friday afternoon. It remains unclear whether the FBI inquiry will upset the balance in the race. The bureau disclosed nothing about the Abedin emails, including whether any of the messages were sent by or to Clinton. Over the summer, the FBI said it was closing its investigation into Clintons use of a private email system while secretary of state. Until Friday, her campaign seemed to have weathered the initial FBI email probe. Clinton has held a lead averaging four to seven percentage points in polls in recent weeks as the Trump campaign wrestled with accusations by women of groping and other sexual advances. Trump has said none of the accusations are true. He also struggled in the recent presidential debates and faced questions about his taxes. As of Thursday, Clintons odds of receiving the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency remained at greater than 95 percent, according to State of the Nation polling results released Saturday. The project estimated she would win by 320 votes to 218, with 278 votes solidly for the Democrat. Clintons lead among early voters is similar to the lead enjoyed by President Barack Obama over Republican Mitt Romney at this point of the 2012 race, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll taken at the time. Obama won the election by 332 electoral votes to Romneys 206. But even before the latest email news, it had been a difficult week for Clinton. News coverage of Trumps accusers had diminished, while Clinton confronted the almost daily release by WikiLeaks of emails purportedly hacked from her campaign managers account. This weeks leaked messages raised questions about former President Bill Clintons finances. And her lead in the States of the Nation project fell slightly from last week. Though the projected Electoral College votes hardly moved, the number of states solidly for Clinton slid from 25 to 20 this week. Trump didnt see any additional states tilt solidly to him, but he did see some gains The swing states of Pennsylvania, Colorado, Iowa and Nevada all moved from leaning to Clinton to being too close to call. Still, Trumps path to a victory is narrow, and any realistic chance rests on his winning Ohio, North Carolina and Florida. As of Thursday, Ohio remained a tossup. Florida and North Carolina were still tilting toward Clinton, according to the States of the Nation results. Early voting data for Florida and North Carolina was not yet available this week. In Ohio, Clinton led Trump by double digits among early voters. The projects broader polling suggests the state is deadlocked between the two candidates. In Arizona, Clinton also was solidly ahead among early voters. In the past month, Arizona has gradually moved from a solid Trump state to a marginal Clinton state, although it is still too close to call, according to the project results. In Georgia, she enjoyed a similar lead among early voters. Overall, Georgia leans to Trump, but his lead narrowed to five percentage points this week, down from eights points last week and 13 points a month ago. Even in Texas, where Trump enjoys a sizable lead, Clinton has a doubledigit edge among early voters, according to project results.

"By Hrafnkell Haraldsson   512 pm Trump sat on the stage, looking for all the world like an honored donor to the cause, and then got up and left without leaving a donation   Not only is Donald Trump a liar and a thinskinned crybaby, but he is selfish, never spending his own money when he can spend somebody elses. This behavior was never more in evidence than The Washington Post s David Fahrentholds account of a 1996 a ribboncutting held by the Association to Benefit Children for a nursery school, when Donald Trump showed up, sat down to appear to be a great supporter, and then left without leaving a donation As Sopan Deb tweeted ,  Sopan Deb @SopanDeb October 29, 2016 Frank and Kathie Lee Gifford were big donors and it is no wonder Gifford was so shocked by Trumps presence. What had been exposed is that Trumps life is a sham, a gigantic show put on by him in which he parades through life pretending to be something he is not. As Fahrenthold explains , For as long as he has been rich and famous, Donald Trump has also wanted people to believe he is generous. He spent years constructing an image as a philanthropist by appearing at charity events and by making very public  even nationally televised  promises to give his own money away. It was, in large part, a facade. A monthslong investigation by The Washington Post has not been able to verify many of Trumps boasts about his philanthropy. That philanthropist isnt the real Trump. The only person Trump visibly cares about is Donald Trump. He uses his Foundation to buy himself nice things, spending other peoples money for luxury items and collectibles. When he does make donations, it is again, because he gives no money to his own Foundation, with other peoples money. Fahrenthold says that the only donation of Trumps own money the paper could find from the period of 2008 to today, is a 10,000 gift to the Police Athletic League of New York City, in 2009. For a man as rich as Trump claims to be, 10,000 in eight years is nothing to brag about. Not that this stops the monumental, deadbeat hypocrite that is Donald Trump from bragging anyway.",bias
"By Hrafnkell Haraldsson on Sat, Oct 29th, 2016 at 841 pm That fog thats on Christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the Body of Christ because theres spirits being authorized to be released   Coming from people who believe in something called spiritual warfare a nebulous spiritual struggle taking place over and above all the talk about issues and policy positions  it is perhaps no surprise that the Religious Right should declare that their messiah  Donald Trump  is being threatened with witchcraft. Lance Wallnau, whose Twitter page claims to be Your Spiritual Warfare Guide to the 2016 Election, appeared on The Jim Bakker Show to push the crazy idea that many Christians feel this fog on their head at times and that fog thats on Christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the Body of Christ because theres spirits being authorized to be released. Watch courtesy of Right Wing Watch Oh sweet baby Jesus, the mighty Lance has struck out. What has happened, of course, is that the Religious Right not only endorsed but anointed a candidate who embodies the exact opposite of the values they claim to champion. Its no wonder they feel in a fog . Metaphorically or physically, theyre selling their souls. Wallnau claims The left is a smaller number of radicals better organized than the larger body of Christ who doesnt work together, and Thats the dilemma that Americas in right now, even though the left is a disparate alliance of various groups working together and the Religious Right has been organizing since Goldwater lost in 64 . A hypocrite just cant catch a break, it seems The web literally is coming down on America. And whats sad is, how many Christians feel this fog on their head at times Do you feel that Its almost like everythings going wrong. We dont realize its a remnant operating strategically through organizations that are intent on shifting the American culture and discipling the country. And that fog thats on Christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the Body of Christ because theres spirits being authorized to be released. Wherever theres agreement, theres power. The more unbelievers agree with the narrative that theyre hearing, the more power and authorization Satan has to manifest. So unless the church has an exposure of what the enemys doing and begins to agree together with a counterstrategy, were going to deal with more and more fog. And the worst part iswe dont have to surrender nations to the devil. So if you disagree with Wallnau, if you oppose Trump, it can only because youre manifesting the power of Satan who in the Old Testament is Gods lieutenant, not his adversary. So pick your Testament, I suppose. Lance Wallnau insists he is not a big conspiracy theorist buff, but this doesnt do anything to convince us hes not some wackadoodle instead. This is nothing new, as a nonChristian being told that you represent a devil you dont even believe exists. There are 2,000 years of history backing up the accusation and testifying to its usefulness for religious zealots hoping to delegitimize or worse their opponents. Without charges of Satanism and witchcraft, you dont have the genocide of European and Middle Eastern Paganism you dont have antiJewish pogroms and you dont have the Crusades or the Spanish Inquisition you dont have witchburnings. What this sort of nonsense illustrates for liberals and progressives is that were not fighting on the same battleground as our opponents. Not only do they deal in a conspiracyladen world, a world free of facts, but a world in which what might be hiding under your bed or in your closet has real power and reason  and lets go ahead and say sanity  do not. Lets face it Donald Trumps biggest enemy is not Satan, but Donald Trump himself. And Wallnau can claim believers have an edge all they want, but all the belief in the world wont overturn reality.",bias
"On Meet The Press, Clinton campaign manager Robbie Mook said that early voting is so strong for Democrats in Nevada that Hillary Clinton could build an insurmountable lead this week. Video Chuck Todd asked Mook if he believed the email story could cost Clinton the election. He answered I dont think so. Look, as I said, we have over 50,000 volunteers out there. Were seeing record early voting numbers in North Carolina, Florida. Look, I would wager in Nevada turnout is so strong among Democrats there Hillary could build an insurmountable lead in the coming days in Nevada. Were feeling really good about this record turnout. Over 200 million people in our country now registered to vote. Fifty million of those are young people. Were just nose to the grindstone, and were going to finish this out. But people should not take anything for granted, and were going to have to work hard to earn this. Hillary Clinton could put Nevada out of reach for Trump this week, but whether or not that happens is up to the voters. If Democrats continue to vote in overwhelming numbers in swing states, the email story wont matter. If Democrats dont show up, that is Trumps only chance of winning. The early voting numbers that Hillary Clinton is running up in Florida, North Carolina, and Nevada are no accident. Clinton and the Democratic Party have invested heavily in an extensive get out the vote operation in early voting states. Democrats already had a strategic advantage in early voting before the 2016 election, but Donal Trumps refusal to invest in a substantial get out the vote operation has widened the gap between the two parties in this area. The final week before the election could be just as vital to Democrats in swing states as election day. If Hillary Clinton piles up big margins in early voting, it could leave minimal drama for election night. The Democratic early voting plan is working to perfection, now as Mook said, all that is left is for Democrats to put their heads down, work hard, and close the deal.

Share on Twitter Print This Post The CBS News Republicans hoped that FBI Director James Comeys letter about new Clinton related emails would swing the election for them, but a new series of CBS News Battleground polls shows Clinton keeping her lead and within 2 points of Trump in Arizona. Battleground tracker found that by a small margin Comeys letter made Democrats more likely net 7 to support Clinton. In the individual battleground states, Clinton leads by eight points in Pennsylvania 4840, North Carolina 4845, and in Colorado 4239. The only state of the four polled where Trump has a small two point lead in Arizona 4442. According to CBS News , And the larger demographic difference defining the race between Clinton and Donald Trump has been a gender gap  slightly larger now than the last time in these states  that offsets a smaller movement of Republicans to Trump. To put it another way, Hillary Clintons support with women is going up at a larger rate than Republican movement towards Trump. These are the first swing state polls to be taken since FBI Director Comey released his now infamous letter on Friday. The email story isnt moving voters. It is reinforcing the partisanship of the election. Democrats are going to vote Clinton. Republicans are going to vote for Trump, and there arent enough undecided voters to swing the election to Trump. Republicans were hoping for a Hail Mary touchdown to save Trump, but Clinton continues to lead in critical states with a little more than a week to go before election day.

"By Robert Franek on Sun, Oct 30th, 2016 at 901 am Imagine if working to end rape culture were treated with the same attention as Hillary Clintons emails. This is one fire that is burning strong and is a true threat to personal and public safety, security, and wellbeing. Share on Twitter Print This Post The following post, written by The Rev. Robert A. Franek, is a part of Politicus Policy Discussion, in which writers draw connections between real lives and public policy. Even after months and months of coverage blown out of proportion and at great expense to the public in dollars, psychic stress, and issue coverage ,it seems all one has to do is put Hillary Clinton and emails together in the same sentence with claims of lying and threatening national security and pandemonium continues to break loose throughout the mass media and social media worlds. And yet despite multiple investigations and repeated explanations the pandemonium persists, so much so that every time Republicans stir up some smoke the media assumes there must be a blazing fire. And sadly this is not going away anytime soon, as Republicans are promising more sham investigations in lieu of actually governing as Sarah Jones reported. Republicans are already planning how to avoid being grown ups who do their jobs if Hillary Clinton is elected president. Yes, there will be more toythrowing and tantrums and best of all for the party of fiscal humiliations, more wasteful spending on political witch hunts.  Sarah Jones Meanwhile, women continue to come forward with painful, heartbreaking stories of Donald Trumps sexual harassment and assault. Yet, instead of being portrayed as survivors who have finally had enough of the Republican presidential nominee and his lies and as women who have the strength and courage to go public with their stories, they are being made into opportunistic victims and challenged for not coming forward sooner much sooner. Woefully, no mention is made of the many intersecting reasons that lead many women and men not to report these crimes, including that this is the only time when the victim is placed on trial. After walking her readers through one incident of Donald Trumps public sexual humiliation of a woman for revenge , Sarah Jones makes the following observation If there is any good to come out of the total crapfest of the Trump candidacy, perhaps it is a raised awareness that women are people and that this kind of thing is horrific but its not all Trumps fault. Its the cultures fault because it takes a willing audience to successfully publicly sexually shame a woman. She is right. Donald Trump is despicable. Still, there is cultural culpability in the perpetuation of rape culture where women are treated as objects, forced into silence, and placed on trial for their assailants crimes. This must change. It is unacceptable in a country that places such a high value on freedom that so many are not free from sexual harassment, assault, exploitation, and humiliation. More it is appalling that such behavior is often cheered, unchallenged, and dismissed. It is also inexcusable that survivors face unparalleled levels of scrutiny when they do finally come forward. It is also beyond tragic that people of faith who read the first chapter of Genesis cant bear out the implications of men and women being created simultaneously and bearing equally the divine image. Supposed Christian values champion and Republican Vice Presidential nominee, Mike Pence is more upset over an article he didnt read regarding voter suppression efforts by the Trump campaign than any of the horrifying things Donald Trump has said including bragging about sexual assault. These are not Christian values nor are they values any civil society should hold. Failing to call out Donald Trumps abhorrent behavior and speech is beyond deplorable. Additionally, supporting candidates like Donald Trump and Mike Pence gives validity to their wretched views and is especially shocking when done by people of faith and family values. As a society, we must challenge the pervasive and systemic sexism and misogyny that persists in our culture. As much as we need changes in our laws and lawmakers at every level of government to reflect the equality and humanity of women, we need a moral revival in our collective conscience as a nation that decries every facet of rape culture from how we raise our children to the victim blaming and shaming that happens each time a survivor goes public with their story. Imagine if working to end rape culture were treated with the same attention as Hillary Clintons emails.

"Senate Democrats arent playing around with FBI Director James Comey. Four top Democrats sent Comey and Attorney General Loretta Lynch a letter demanding details on the emails that the FBI is investigating by Monday. In the letter, Sens. Carper, Leahy, Feinstein, and Cardin wrote Senate Democrats arent fooling around. They want answers, and they want them right now. As more details become known, FBI Director Comeys motives have come under criticism. Comey was advised by Attorney General Lynch not to send his letter until after the election, but he sent it anyway. Comey worried to FBI employees that his letter would be misunderstood, but he could have easily avoided any misunderstanding by either being specific in his letter or not sending the letter at all. It is becoming difficult to look at Comeys actions in an objective manner and not see partisan political motivations. The FBI Director has interfered in a presidential election with new emails that have nothing to do with the Democratic nominee, but can be used by her opponents for political purposes. Democrats are demanding answers, and if James Comey doesnt answer their questions by Monday, he will be forced to under oath if the Democratic Party wins a majority of seats in the Senate. Either way, Comeys October surprise has blown up in his own face.",bias
"Richard W. Painter wrote in a New York Times an oped The F.B.I.s job is to investigate, not to influence the outcome of an election. Such acts could also be prohibited under the Hatch Act, which bars the use of an official position to influence an election. That is why the F.B.I. presumably would keep those aspects of an investigation confidential until after the election. The usual penalty for a violation is termination of federal employment. And that is why, on Saturday, I filed a complaint against the F.B.I. with the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates Hatch Act violations, and with the Office of Government Ethics. I have spent much of my career working on government ethics and lawyers ethics, including two and a half years as the chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, and I never thought that the F.B.I. could be dragged into a political circus surrounding one of its investigations. Until this week. This is the second complaint to be filed against FBI Director Comey. The Democratic Coalition Against Trump has also filed a complaint against Comey for interfering in a presidential election as a federal employee. Suspicion around Comeys actions has grown as the FBI Director is not expected to make any additional statements on this matter before the presidential election. Director Comey appears to have set himself for problems after the election as Senate Democrats are making it known that they are open to holding hearings to investigate the FBI investigation if they win back the Senate majority. Unless Trump wins and Republicans take control of Congress, Director Comey is going to have to answer for his decisions. As the complaints pile up, it looks like Congressional testimony may be the least of James Comeys future problems.",bias

Share on Twitter Print This Post Fox News Sundays Chris Wallace tried to blame Hillary Clinton for the email scandal that Republicans created and got destroyed by Clinton campaign manager Robbie Mook. This exchange between Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace and Clinton campaign manager Robbie Mook highlighted why the email scandal isnt working for the GOP. Video Transcript via Fox News Sunday WALLACE The last question I want to ask you is that youre acting as if it was the director who brought this into the election when the fact is that it was Hillary Clinton who brought this into the election. I want to go back to the email exchange on March 2nd, 2015, when The New York Times broke the story about Hillary Clinton using private emails. Were going to put it up on the screen. Clinton adviser Neera Tanden, Why didnt they get the stuff out like 18 months ago So crazy. Campaign chairman John Podesta, Unbelievable. Tanden, I guess I know the answer, they wanted to get away with it. Robby, it was Clinton who delayed and it was Clinton who brought this into the presidential campaign. MOOK And it is Secretary Clinton who has said this was a mistake. It is Secretary Clinton who cooperated fully with the investigation. And it was Secretary Clinton who accepted the outcome of that investigation. And what secretary Clinton is doing now is saying, if theres new information, get it out on the table. Lets get it out. These could be duplicates. Again, its been reported these emails may not have been sent or received by Secretary Clinton. We dont know anything. And this close to an election, this unprecedented announcement of new information, when  when, again, its been reported by Yahoo News that  that the FBI may have not even seen it. That  that  that Director Comey sent this unprecedented letter shortly before the election when he doesnt even know what the information is. Thats disturbing. And were just asking him, get everything out there that he knows. Fox News has no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Clinton, so they have been reduced to whining about why she didnt release the emails sooner. What Wallace left out was that the release of Clintons emails represented an unprecedented level of disclosure. Hillary Clinton didnt cause this email scandal. House Republicans misused their Benghazi Select Committee to go on a fishing expedition for Hillary Clintons emails. Robbie Mook destroyed Fox News with facts, because unlike Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton hasnt worked to keep information hidden from the public. Trump has not released his tax returns, medical records, or an accounting of his business dealings with Russia. Trump has been the least transparent nominee in more than 40 years. Republicans and conservative media are blaming Clinton for the scandal that they created as justification for continuing the investigations of her after the election. Clintons campaign manager was able to wipe the floor with the Republican talking points because at the end of the day the email scandal remains a conspiracy about nothing.",bias

Share on Twitter Print This Post A Trump supporter sporting a Hillary for Prison tshirt chanted Jews SA in support of his candidate during a rally in Arizona on Saturday. The target was the pen of reporters who have been fodder for Trumps rhetoric at every rally. The context While the crowd was chanting USA one man chanted Jews SA. Words like that cant be spun or read into. The intent and meaning were obvious to everyone. Watch here on video obtained by The Huffington Post . This sort of thing comes as no surprise considering that Donald Trump spent the last year spewing hate filled venom in every possible direction. It may seem superfluous to restate every category of people for which Trump has shown contempt, but it is not. Muslims, Jews, immigrants, labor, taxpayers, Latinos, Hispanics, Mexicans, AfricanAmericans, women, POWs, veterans, people with disabilities, Gold Star Families, and the military have felt the sting of Trumps words and the disdain in his heart. Throughout this campaign season, the vitriol against Hillary Clinton saw no limit. Signs and Tshirts too disgusting to quote in this article. Chants of lock her up at the Republican convention and since. Trump promised his base of thugs, lowlifes, and haters he would weaken the first amendment, strengthen the second and establish the altright utopia. Hillary Clinton was already the most qualified candidate in this race. She also proved to have more stamina than any previous candidate needed. Not only was she competing against a vicious and pathological liar, she was competing for who we are and who we could be. For all the Trump claims that the media is rigged in Clintons favor, it was Trump who got free advertising, who framed the narrative and whose words were the primary news stories of the campaign. There is no doubt that Hillary Clinton will keep her promise to fight for us. She has been doing it from the beginning of this campaign. Every time Hillary Clinton called out Donald Trumps sexist comments, she was fighting for all women who were attacked, humiliated and sexually abused by men like Trump. Every time Clinton shamed Trumps horrific and disgusting comments about the Khan family she was standing up for every Gold Star family. She was also standing up for every MuslimAmerican. The same is true every time Clinton condemned Trump for mocking a disabled reporter or resorted to altright stereotypes about AfricanAmericans, innercities, and AfricanAmerican communities. Every time Trump spewed hate in whatever direction, Hillary Clinton defended the target. So no, this isnt about choosing the lesser of two evils. Like every election, this is about choosing our next president. More importantly, its about voting for who we are and who we aspire to be. Image Screengrab from video.",bias
"Here is the full text of Sen. Reids letter to Director Comey Dear Director Comey Your actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another. I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act, which bars FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election. Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law. The double standard established by your actions is clear. In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government  a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity. The public has a right to know this information. I wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public. There is no danger to American interests from releasing it. And yet, you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information. By contrast, as soon as you came into possession of the slightest innuendo related to Secretary Clinton, you rushed to publicize it in the most negative light possible. Moreover, in tarring Secretary Clinton with thin innuendo, you overruled longstanding tradition and the explicit guidance of your own Department. You rushed to take this step eleven days before a presidential election, despite the fact that for all you know, the information you possess could be entirely duplicative of the information you already examined which exonerated Secretary Clinton. As you know, a memo authored by Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates on March 10, 2016, makes clear that all Justice Department employees, including you, are subject to the Hatch Act. The memo defines the political activity prohibited under the Hatch Act as activity directed towards the success or failure of a political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group. The clear doublestandard established by your actions strongly suggests that your highly selective approach to publicizing information, along with your timing, was intended for the success or failure of a partisan candidate or political group. Please keep in mind that I have been a supporter of yours in the past. When Republicans filibustered your nomination and delayed your confirmation longer than any previous nominee to your position, I led the fight to get you confirmed because I believed you to be a principled public servant. With the deepest regret, I now see that I was wrong. Sincerely, Senator Harry Reid Reid basically accused Comey of violating the Hatch Act by releasing his letter so close to a presidential election. Even though Harry Reid is retiring, the bad news for Comey is that Reids letter is a clear sign that Senate Democrats arent going to let this matter drop.

"The Trump campaign is having a collective nervous breakdown after the James Comey letter about new Hillary Clinton emails failed to swing the election in his direction.

This is why Trump is going to spend the last week of his presidential campaign in blue states that he has no chance of winning. Trump still thinks that he can win Michigan, Wisconsin, and New Mexico. Wisconsin might be the most laughable of three delusions because Trump was routed in the Republican primary there, and GOP support from Wisconsin Republicans like Paul Ryan and Scott Walker has been lukewarm at best. These are the final days that all losing campaigns go through when the nominee refuses to accept the likelihood of their defeat. The Comey letter didnt move the needle for Trump. It didnt give him a surge of national momentum or make the majority of voters rethink their support for Hillary Clinton. The Clinton emails didnt save Trump, so now he is going to waste his time campaigning in states that he will lose in search of a miracle as his poorly managed presidential bid stumbles to the finish line.",bias
"By Rmuse on Sun, Oct 30th, 2016 at 953 pm The F.B.I. has a solemn obligation to remain neutral in political matters the faintest appearance of using the agency to influence our election is deeply troubling. Share on Twitter Print This Post The following is an opinion column by R Muse As a nation of laws, the American people should, and most likely do, demand that law enforcement officials hew as closely to the law as humanly possible and that goes double for the countrys largest investigative agency. One thing every American who has ever watched a law enforcement press conference after a crime has occurred understands is that the public never really knows the details of an investigation regardless the severity of the crime or who the suspect is. As an occasional print journalist, this author can attest that asking a police spokesman for details during a press conference about what the police are doing or who they are investigating never fails to get a stern scolding about expecting law enforcement to reveal any facts during an investigation for glaringly obvious reasons. The scold always includes referral to the agency responsible for charging and prosecuting a crime after the investigation is complete and the results are handed over to the local district attorney. Apparently, the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI director James Comey never got the memo that discussing an investigation publicly is verboten if for no other reason than to maintain the integrity of said investigation and not hamper a possible prosecution. However, as it turns out Mr. Comey did get a memo  from the Department of Justice in the form of a warning . But because he is a law unto himself and his allegiance is to House Republicans and not the Department of Justice, he ignored the DOJ counsel to do a solid for the GOP less than two weeks before a presidential election. Since Mr. Comey cant keep it investigations in his pants, or follow longstanding law enforcement and investigative rules, or take heed to Justice Department warnings, it is incumbent on President Barack Obama to summarily fire F.B.I. Director James Comey on the morning of Wednesday, November 9th 2016. Why should President Obama wait until the day after a general election to fire the partisan director of the F.B.I. So as not to give the appearance of any impropriety or partisanship during a campaign or just prior a presidential election something FBI director James Comey is apparently incapable of comprehending. This incident, just like the one in July when Comey broke precedent and convened a press conference in July, and then publicly testified before Congress to discuss the Bureaus ongoing investigation is more than just a breach of precedent it smacks of partisanship for more than one reason. First, as mentioned above, not only did the Department of Justice warn Mr. Comey that it was inappropriate to discuss an ongoing investigation at all, much less so close to an election, that warning came after the F.B.I. contacted the DOJ about going public with information the Bureau admitted it had not yet even  reviewed . That was precisely what Comey told his Republican buddies in a letter to Congress. In the letter , Comey told congressional Republicans that the F.B.I. really had no clue whether any of the emails were related to Hillary Clintons private email server, but what he did  know  for sure was that they  appeared  to be pertinent even though his agency, the F.B.I. had not yet examined them. So the real pertinent question is why did Mr. Comey publicly inform Congress about emails the agency had not yet examined if he wasnt attempting to inject some  partisan drama  into the election that might have deleterious impact on the outcome It is just as pertinent a question as demanding to know from Mr. Comey precisely what his motivation was in holding a press conference back in July to discuss the agencys finding on an investigation before the DOJ weighed in, or discuss that investigation in public and before a viciously partisan Republican committee in Congress. And no, it was not to defend the Bureaus decision not to bring criminal charges against Clinton only a braindead moronic imbecile or partisan Republican hack would begin to think that the F.B.I., C.I.A., local sheriff, or any police investigative agency has the ability to bring charges to prosecute a violation. For dogs sake even the 1960s fictional sheriff Andy Griffiths hapless deputy Barney Fife was competent enough to comprehend that a district attorneys office or Department of Justice is tasked with prosecution any violation of the law. According to Mr. Comey, who was  stung by criticism from both Democrats and Republicans  as well as former prosecutors and  appeared to be on the defensive   he felt obligated to inform Republicans in Congress  even though the Bureau really didnt  know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails.  Likely because he knew they did not come from Hillary Clinton. As an aside, Sarah Jones has a nifty summary of the email caper the F.B.I. Uncovered while investigating  serial sexter  Anthony Weiners laptop computer, iPad, and cellphone. And no, Anthony Weiner was not sexting nasty pictures to presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. It doesnt matter what kind of pathetic excuse Comey gave for publicly commenting on an ongoing investigation, it is virtually impossible to believe he didnt have partisan intents and purposes in publicly alerting House Republicans. As interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, Donna Brazile said,  The F.B.I. has a solemn obligation to remain neutral in political matters  even the faintest appearance of using the agencys power to influence our election is deeply troubling . Ms. Brazile demanded more information from Comey and didnt conceal her concern over Comey interfering with the election. Mr. Comey claimed, very conveniently one might add, that as a diedinthewool Republican he contributed to John McCain and Willard Romneys presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012 respectively, that he is not a Republican now. That was his remark back in July when he first began breaking precedent and revealing information about an investigation that was the proper purview of the Department of Justice, not the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It was a suspicious  confession  in July and it is nearly impossible to believe in late October after he ignored Department of Justice warnings and revealed information about an ongoing investigation into a disgraced former congressman and serial sexter just 11 days before an election and before the Bureau had even reviewed anything. Comey cannot possibly remain as head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation after twice revealing information about an ongoing investigation. If Comey hadnt taken heat for his reveal in July, and a warning from the Justice Department this week, then one might just regard him as an inept law enforcement official pulling a publicity stunt for attention. But since he was warned, and is not an inept law enforcement official, it is more than reasonable to believe that Comeys most recent act was a partisan political ploy that should earn him a summary termination on November 9, 2016. Because firing his partisan personage just prior to the general election would break a longstanding precedent and look like a highly partisan move something a sap like James Comey might try, but not President Obama.",bias
"By Adalia Woodbury on Sun, Oct 30th, 2016 at 1131 pm On Friday, the Supreme Court decided to weigh in on transgender rights in the case of Gloucester County School Board vs. G.G. This gives the right wing another chance to take civil rights away from people they dont like. Plain and simple. Share on Twitter Print This Post On Friday, the Supreme Court decided to weigh in on transgender rights in the case of Gloucester County School Board vs. G.G . This gives the right wing another chance to take civil rights away from people they dont like. Plain and simple. At issue is whether a transgender student who identifies as a boy has a right to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender he identifies with. Last summer, the court granted the school boards request to put a lower court ruling in the students favor on hold until the board filed its petition for review by the Supreme Court. Justice Breyer joined the conservative justices in that ruling as a courtesy. The Virginia school board established a policy mirroring bathroom police laws in red states like North Carolina that required students to use rest rooms and locker rooms to correspond with the gender they were assigned at birth. In this case, the district court ruled against G.G. by relying on a 1975 regulation allowing schools to provide separate toilet, locker room and shower facilities based on sex provided those facilities are comparable to those provided to the opposite sex. In January 2015, the Department of Educations Office of Civil Rights issued a letter opining that if schools separate students in restroom and locker rooms based on their sex a school must treat transgender students in a manner consistent with their gender identity. Because of that letter, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit reversed the lower court ruling in favor of G.G. It relied on a 1997 Supreme Court decision that courts generally should defer to an agencys interpretation of its own regulation. In reality, the right wing hopes to achieve two political objectives with this case. First, this is about denying basic rights and dignity to people who are transgender, which is consistent with their ideological opposition to rights for women, POC and members of the LGBT community. Second, the right wing is hoping to weaken Federal Agencies by attacking their ability to interpret their own regulations.",bias
"By Hrafnkell Haraldsson on Mon, Oct 31st, 2016 at 759 am In Donald Trump you have a candidate who is frequently saying 20 false things in a day, up to 37 on some days. Share on Twitter Print This Post CNNs Brian Stelter calls Donald Trump a uniquely factchallenged candidate, which is a prelude to introducing Daniel Dale, Washington correspondent for the Toronto Star , who fact checks every single word Trump utters and tallies them up for his paper . Dale says most factcheckers look at two or three things Trump says, meticulously factchecks them and posts an article, but that doesnt work when you have a candidate who is frequently saying 20 false things in a day, up to 37 on some days. For example, Dale tallied 35 Trump lies on Tuesday, October 25 Donald Trump said 35 false things yesterday. #TrumpCheck pic.twitter.com/EwfYFEDFx9  Daniel Dale @ddale8 October 26, 2016 Which, as Dale pointed out , followed his recordtying 37 false claims on Monday, not coincidentally, a day on which Trump called fact checkers scum. Watch courtesy of CNNs Reliable Sources There is a massive imbalance in the frequency of dishonesty. @DDale8 says Trump lies a lot more than Clinton https//t.co/Kp6KvPNtmO  Reliable Sources @ReliableSources October 30, 2016 The mainstream media likes to play the false equivalence game but there is no equivalence between Trump and Clinton. As Dale told Stelter, There is a massive imbalance in the frequency of dishonesty. Trump, says Dale, is not a normal political liar. For example, look at the presidential debates , in which Dale found 104 Trump false statements as opposed to 13 by Clinton. Dales judgment is that there is no comparison in her level of accuracy with her opponent. Trump also lies pointlessly, argues Dale, explaining to Brian Stelter that, He gets things wrong where there is no political advantage to be gained and in those cases, it is not clear whether hes lying or confused or unwilling to take the time to learn the facts. This was Mark Cubans complaint, of course, that Trump has no interest in learning. In the end, it matters less why Trump lies than that he does, especially since he is busily convincing his base that Hillary Clinton is the dishonest candidate. And it is working. This is a trope frequently repeated by Trumps supporters. You can correct them as often as you want it will have no effect. The lie has taken hold  one of many  many more than you likely expected, and observational bias takes care of the rest. The Trump base is effectively lost to our shared reality, and as Dale tweeted last night, If Trump loses, the Smart Republican Excavation is going to have to involve some long, hard base reeducation. Given the GOPs history with facts, good luck with that. Image Screen capture Twitter",bias
"By Rmuse   1003 am The archdiocese holds the matter among its highest priorities. If passed, the law would have significantly detrimental impacts on our parishes, our ministries   The following is an opinion column by R Muse For almost all secular humanists, organized religion is nothing more than an easy means of controlling people through fear and intimidation. Throughout recorded history, the Catholic Church has been responsible for all manner of devious machinations to control not just its adherents, but any humans it comes in contact with. That lust to control human beings has continued unabated into the 21st Century and in America like the rest of the Earth the Catholics number one focus has been on controlling women. Apparently, the Catholic Church in Massachusetts wants to expand its control over the population. On Friday the Boston Globe reported that the Archdiocese of Boston dropped about a million dollars in a lastditch effort to exert Church control over Massachusetts law and citizens to stop marijuana from being legalized for recreational use. Other reports reveal that the taxexempt political spending is meant to help defeat a Massachusetts ballot measure, Question 4 . Question 4 simply legalizes cannabis for recreational use for people over 21 and creates a commission to regulate marijuana in the state of Massachusetts. Question 4 contains no references to the Catholic, or any other church, and makes no claim of trying to  impact ministries . A spokesman for the Boston Archdiocese, Terrence Donilon, made a truly pathetic attempt at justifying the Catholic churchs political donation to the campaign against Massachusetts version of legalized recreational marijuana saying   It reflects the fact that the archdiocese holds the matter among its highest priorities. Its a recognition that, if passed, the law would have significantly detrimental impacts on our parishes, our ministries . Seriously, that has to be one of the most monumental piles of bovine excrement of a reason to use taxfree congregants donations to interfere in an election ever offered. Nowhere in Massachusetts or any states decriminalization statutes is any church mentioned, much less affected by the outcome of an election. Catholic priests will still be free to sexually abuse little boys if adults can legally purchase and consume cannabis. And despite residents having a toke in the privacy of their homes, the Church will still frighten its members into increasing their tithes, and the USCCB will still attempt to control and dominate all American women. No reefer decriminalization will impact the Catholic ministry, but it will drastically reduce the number of people being arrested and imprisoned for marijuana possession, free up law enforcement to pursue nasty pedophile priests, and relieve Americas overburdened judicial system. Now, the Catholics claim that people using cannabis legally, whether they inhale or eat it, will have  significantly detrimental impacts on their ministries . That is an odd assertion on yet another point Surely part of Catholic ministries is teaching according to their gods word in the Christian bible. It is nearly certain that every Catholic priest on the planet, including those in Massachusetts, are aware of gods word in Genesis where in chapter 2, verse 9 the Catholics  almighty god  said  Out of the ground the LORD God caused to grow every tree that is pleasing to the sight and good for food.  And he continues in verses 1517 ,  Then the LORD God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to cultivate it and keep it. The LORD God commanded the man, saying, From any tree of the garden you may eat freely, but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die . Although there is recorded evidence that cannabis was first discovered to be used for its medicinal qualities 10,000 years ago , there is no record of reefer ever being confused with  The tree of the knowledge of good and evil  weed is not and will not affect the Catholic ministries if it is decriminalized today any more than it has over the past twothousand years the Catholic Church has existed and cannabis was either unknown to the clergy or illegal. In a reaction to the news the archdiocese was interfering with politics with taxexempt money, an advocate and spokesman for the Yes on Question 4, Jim Borghesani, said   The archdiocese has come up with a position that, frankly, we think is based on unfounded assumptions and junk science. What I think the archdiocese is missing is the terrible harm that marijuana prohibition has done to people of color, to people who have chosen a substance that is less dangerous than alcohol and have had their lives ruined because theyve been arrested . One wonders if part of the Boston archdioceses ministry entails increasing the number of Americans, mainly Americans of color, sent to prison for possessing or using a plant that  god caused to grow  and was  pleasing to the sight and good to eat . Obviously, that is the case and according to a new set of data, keeping marijuana illegal means keeping Americans arrested for drug possession at a rate of every 25 seconds of every day of the year. Why is the Catholic Church so interested in perpetuating the failed War on Drugs in general, and the criminalization of marijuana in particular As noted by Michael Stone over at Patheos, what the Massachusetts Catholics, and Mormons, are actually helping to sustain is  in reality a war on poor people and people of color . Mr. Stone really nails it when he said that by spending taxexempt donations on a political agenda to  defend the unjust prohibition on marijuana the Catholic church is guilty of perpetuating the failed War on Drugs and the New Jim Crow . The archdiocese is also guilty of hypocrisy, besides implicit racism. Because any religious organization that condones and even promotes the use of alcohol while using taxexempt donations to maintain the ridiculous prohibition on cannabis is  morally indefensible . Mormons are also busy instructing LDS members to vote against all state initiatives that seek to decriminalize and regulate recreational marijuana use as if it has any affect whatsoever on either their private Mormon lives or their LDS ministry, but they allegedly dont condone or enjoy alcohol so they just have control issues and are not blatant hypocrites at least where cannabis decriminalization is concerned. The Massachusetts Catholics may not be violating the law by  acting as an antimarijuana super PAC , but they are using taxexempt member donations to politically influence an election and control other Americans lives the church is all about wielding ultimate control over all facets of American society. However, if the Church is so flush with money why not use that money to compensate the thousands of victims of the Churchs pedophile priests Or, dog forbid, use that taxexempt donors money to help the people of Massachusetts in need. The Catholic Church is guilty of using fear and intimidation to control its own adherents, and that is down to frightened people needing a  daddy figure in the Church to tell them what is right, what is wrong, and how to stay out of the proverbial Hell that is all well and good for people that willingly cry out for a controlling organization speaking for a deity. But for people that are not  in the church  it is an affront to use donated taxexempt money to impact read control their private lives. The only good news out of this abominable story is that it looks like Question 4 will pass with relative ease informing that the archdiocese wasted about a million dollars of its congregations hardearned money. This is yet another example of why all churches should be taxed like every other business and American citizen, except Donald Trump. It is  morally obnoxious  that the archdiocese is using the congregations donations for political purposes to influence an election and yet another sign that there is no area the church considers as out of bounds in attempting to control every aspect of society with taxexempt funds wrung out of hardworking Americans, many of whom use recreational cannabis. h/t Patheos",bias
"By Hrafnkell Haraldsson   924 am We cant do waterboarding, its far too tough Were fighting on a different level we have to be tough...and in some cases pretty vicious   Donald Trump complains about spending a fortune on a war in the Middle East that he supported, a war brought to us by a Republican administration that knowingly lied about the facts. Trump is also lying about the facts, which at least brings our countrys Middle East ordeal fullcircle. According to Trump, speaking at a rally in New Mexico  and youve no doubt seen the barrage of commercials repeating the same lie  Hillary brought disaster to Iraq, Syria, Libya and every place that she touches. She empowered Iran and she unleashed ISIS by leaving that big vacuum. Of course, it was Republican President George W. Bush who negotiated the balance of forces agreement with Iraq, stipulating that America draw down its combat strength. Reneging on that agreement would have meant not peace in Iraq, or a negation of ISIS, but a second U.S. invasion on top of the rise of ISIS. We want peace through strength, Trump told the crowd. We dont want to be in wars but these savages are chopping off heads. Well, in fact we DID want to be in that war. We invaded Iraq, not vice versa. Trump went on to say, Drowning people in steel cages, burying people in the sand. We havent had  this is medieval times. This is medieval times and then we cant do waterboarding, its far too tough You know, were fighting on a different level See, were fighting on a different level folks and we have to be tough and we have to be smart and we have to be in some cases pretty vicious, to be honest with you. Pretty vicious, but we have to take them out and then we have to get back to building our country because our country  weve spent 6 trillion in the Middle East. 6 trillion. And we couldve rebuilt our country twice. Never mind for a moment that torture is illegal under international law never mind that a 2014 Senate Intelligence Committees report said torture doesnt work Trumps argument sounds once again like a child wanting to get back at another child who has aggrieved him. This is Trump wanting to spite his enemies on an international scale, and arguing to boot that the end justifies the means. He doesnt, because he cant, prove that acting like barbarians somehow doesnt make us barbarians ourselves. He certainly cant prove, because that Senate report says otherwise, that torturing people will win the war. The claim of 6 million, by the way, is one Trump made last week in Charlotte, NC as well, and PolitiFact ruled it half true at the time, saying, Trump is citing the highend estimate of credible analyses of spending associated with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Yet he is confusing money thats been spent with money that researchers say will be spent. The point here is that this is a war begun not by Obama and certainly not by Hillary Clinton, who at least admits she supported it and has apologized for doing so, while Trump continued to deny he was ever for it, despite the facts to the contrary. When Trump says we have to be pretty vicious he is also saying we have to be pretty dishonest, and nobody lies with such success or at such a rate as Donald Trump. Trump has said he loves war. He has said he likes to be unpredictable. He has asked why we cant use nuclear weapons since we have them. This is a man most national security experts say should not have the nuclear football in his hands. This is a man who, no matter how much he claims otherwise, does not understand how the world works. And he does not understand that by promoting torture, he is only fulfilling the wildest propaganda wishes of the Islamic State, by promising to do precisely what they want him to do.",bias

"By Hrafnkell Haraldsson on Mon, Oct 31st, 2016 at 1220 pm Trump refused 2 produce records sought by prosecutors for 6 months. Said under oath Was destroying them whole time. Share on Twitter Print This Post Newsweek s Kurt Eichenwald has struck again, reporting that Donald Trump refused 2 produce records sought by prosecutors for 6 months. Said under oath Was destroying them whole time. The whole strategy, he writes at Newsweek in an article he swears was written before Comeys announcement, was deny, impede and delay, while destroying documents the court had ordered them to hand over. In 1973, he reveals, the Republican nominee, his father and their real estate company battled the federal government over civil charges that they refused to rent apartments to AfricanAmericans. Shortly after the government filed its case in October, Trump attacked He falsely declared to reporters that the feds had no evidence he and his father discriminated against minorities, but instead were attempting to force them to lease to welfare recipients who couldnt pay their rent.The familys attempts to slow down the federal case were at times nonsensical. Trump submitted an affidavit contending that the government had engaged in some unspecified wrongdoing by releasing statements to the press on the day it brought the case without first having any formal communications with him he contended that hed learned of the complaint only while listening to his car radio that morning. But Trumps sworn statement was a lie. Court records show that the government had filed its complaint at 10 a.m. and phoned him almost immediately afterward. The government later notified the media with a press release.  Six months after the original filing, the case was nowhere because the Trumps had repeatedly ignored the deadlines to produce records and answers to questions, known as interrogatories.Finally, under subpoena, Trump appeared for a short deposition. When asked about the missing documents, he made a shocking admission The Trumps had been destroying their corporate records for the previous six months and had no documentretention program. They had conducted no inspections to determine which files might have been sought in the discovery requests or might otherwise be related to the case. Instead, in order to save space, Trump testified, officials with his company had been tossing documents into the shredder and garbage. So Trump can accuse Hillary Clinton of destroying emails  and he does, nearly every day  but only as a means of covering up and deflecting his own misdeeds in that regard. With false affidavits and deny and delay strategies, writes Eichenwald, Trump  his cos hid and destroyed records sought in court. Donald Trump is a world class liar and a man known for his deflection tactics, projecting his own guilt onto others. His Foundation in trouble Point the finger at the Clinton Foundation. Sexual assault allegations Point the finger at Bill and Hillary Clinton. Once again, Kurt Eichenwald has dug into Donald Trumps deplorable past and revealed the real Donald Trump. Its not pretty. And each revelation from Eichenwald and David Fahrenthold shows Trump to be an even worse human being than the last. It is no wonder his deplorables love him so much.

Representative Chaffetz, in an illplanned partisan attempt, released information that compromised the integrity of the FBI, when he irresponsibly tweeted out that the case investigating Secretary Clintons emails had been reopened, when in fact it had not been. Members of Congress are elected to make our country a safer, better place not to use their power to work with leaders such as Comey in a partisan fashion. I hope that both are held accountable for their actions, said Scott Dworkin, Senior Advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump. Director Comey is already facing a complaint that was filed with Department of Justic e accusing him of violating the Hatch Act by using his position as a federal employee to influence the outcome of an election. The Comey letter couldnt have gone much worse for Republicans. What the GOP originally hoped was an election shifting moment had become a Republican scandal that Democrats are strongly suggesting will inspiring hearings if they win back the Senate majority . Thanks to Chaffetz, House Republicans have already their credibility for future Clinton investigations, a s the Utah Republicans spin of Comeys letter was debunked in a matter of hours. Its all gone wrong in short order for Republicans. Comey and Chaffetz are facing complaints, and Hillary Clinton remains on course to be elected the next President Of The United States.",bias

More of the CNN report  The North Carolina Republican, locked in a tight race for reelection, quipped that as he walked into a gun shop nothing made me feel better than seeing a magazine about rifles with a picture of Hillary Clinton on the front of it. I was a little bit shocked at that  it didnt have a bullseye on it, he said Saturday to GOP volunteers, prompting laughter from the crowd in Mooresville, North Carolina. But on the bottom right of the magazine, it had everybody for federal office in this particular state that they should vote for. So let me assure you, theres an army of support out there right now for our candidates. This type of rhetoric is hardly uncommon when it comes to Republican leaders in 2016. As the campaign has gone on, the hateful and violent rhetoric, particularly from the man at the top of the Republican ticket, has become increasingly worse. At one point this year, Donald Trump suggested that Second Amendment people should take up arms against Clinton if she nominates a Supreme Court justices they dont like. He also said that hed like to see what happens if the Democratic nominees bodyguards were disarmed. As CNN notes, Trump has never issued a genuine apology for his dangerous language  or anything hes ever said or done  but Burr quickly came out with a statement once the audio was revealed, although it does not excuse what he said. The comment I made was inappropriate, and I apologize for it, the Republican senator said, according to CNN. This type of imagery has no place in our politics, regardless of whether its being said in public or private, especially given the heightened level of anger and hatred toward Hillary Clinton from Trump supporters.

Share on Twitter Print This Post A new report is painting CIA Director James Comey as having used his office to influence the presidential election, as Comey sent a letter about Hillary Clintons emails, but refused to call out Russia for meddling in the election by hacking Democrats. CNBC reported  FBI Director James Comey argued privately that it was too close to Election Day for the United States government to name Russia as meddling in the U.S. election and ultimately ensured that the FBIs name was not on the document that the U.S. government put out, a former FBI official tells CNBC. . According to the former official, Comey agreed with the conclusion the intelligence community came to A foreign power was trying to undermine the election. He believed it to be true, but was against putting it out before the election. Comeys position, this official said, was if it is said, it shouldnt come from the FBI, which as youll recall it did not. Director Comey didnt want to interfere in the presidential election by releasing information that could harm Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, but he had no qualms about sending a letter to Congress about emails that he had never seen in an apparent effort to interfere in the current presidential election. With each new revelation and detail, it is becoming impossible not to come to the conclusion that FBI Director Comey may have violated the Hatch Act with his letter to Congress. It is illegal for federal employees to use their positions to interfere in elections. When the information was bad for Donald Trump, Comey argued that it should not be publicly released so close to the election. However, he embraced a different standard when he had less information but could frame it in a way that could damage Hillary Clintons campaign.

"The Washington Post reported Donald Trumps hiring of pollster Tony Fabrizio in May was viewed as a sign that the real estate mogul was finally bringing seasoned operatives into his insurgent operation. But the Republican presidential nominee appears to have taken issue with some of the services provided by the veteran GOP strategist, who has advised candidates from 1996 GOP nominee Bob Dole to Florida Gov. Rick Scott. The Trump campaigns latest Federal Election Commission report shows that it is disputing nearly 767,000 that Fabrizios firm says it is still owed for polling. Trumps decision not to pay his pollster is the first of this type of story but given Trumps history of not paying for services performed it wont be the last. It is astonishing that the party of supposed fiscal responsibility and conservativism would put someone forward as their presidential nominee who has made a career out of running up debt for personal gain. Donald Trumps mentality has always been to put himself first. Paying his debts never seems to have been a top priority for Trump. His businesses have been stiffing vendors and contractors for decades, so it isnt surprising that he would bring this same mentality to the presidential campaign.

"By Sean Colarossi on Mon, Oct 31st, 2016 at 847 pm While the media continues to focus on the Clinton email nonstory, news about Donald Trumps ties to Russia continues to gain steam. Share on Twitter Print This Post While the media continues to focus on what is increasingly becoming a nonstory  FBI Director James Comeys vague letter regarding more emails related to Hillary Clinton  news about Donald Trumps ties to Russia continues to gain steam. Not only did NBC just report that the FBI is now in the preliminary stages of investigating Trumps excampaign managers connection to Russia, but Slate also reported on Monday that a Trump server may have repeatedly been communicating with a Russian bank. Slate claims that while a group of computer scientists was looking into the Russian cyber attack of the DNC, they stumbled onto something unexpectedly. The report In late July, one of these scientistswho asked to be referred to as Tea Leaves, a pseudonym that would protect his relationship with the networks and banks that employ him to sift their datafound what looked like malware emanating from Russia. The destination domain had Trump in its name, which of course attracted Tea Leaves attention. But his discovery of the data was pure happenstancea surprising needle in a large haystack of DNS lookups on his screen. I have an outlier here that connects to Russia in a strange way, he wrote in his notes. He couldnt quite figure it out at first. But what he saw was a bank in Moscow that kept irregularly pinging a server registered to the Trump Organization on Fifth Avenue. More data was needed, so he began carefully keeping logs of the Trump servers DNS activity. As he collected the logs, he would circulate them in periodic batches to colleagues in the cybersecurity world. Six of them began scrutinizing them for clues. The researchers quickly dismissed their initial fear that the logs represented a malware attack. The communication wasnt the work of bots. The irregular pattern of server lookups actually resembled the pattern of human conversationconversations that began during office hours in New York and continued during office hours in Moscow. It dawned on the researchers that this wasnt an attack, but a sustained relationship between a server registered to the Trump Organization and two servers registered to an entity called Alfa Bank. This news doesnt come out of nowhere. Trump has repeatedly praised Vladimir Putin as a strong leader, all while taking proRussia positions throughout the campaign that come straight off a Kremlin wishlist. The Clinton campaign was quick to jump on the report in a statement by Clinton Senior Policy Adviser Jake Sullivan This secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trumps ties to Russia. It certainly seems the Trump Organization felt it had something to hide, given that it apparently took steps to conceal the link when it was discovered by journalists. This line of communication may help explain Trumps bizarre adoration of Vladimir Putin and endorsement of so many proKremlin positions throughout this campaign. It raises even more troubling questions in light of Russias masterminding of hacking efforts that are clearly intended to hurt Hillary Clintons campaign. We can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between Trump and Russia as part of their existing probe into Russias meddling in our elections. Trumps proRussia rhetoric and policy positions are not a coincidence. The more information that comes out, the clearer it is that the Republican nominee has connections to Russia that he is hiding from voters.

"By Sean Colarossi on Mon, Oct 31st, 2016 at 952 pm Trump used a tax avoidance maneuver so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the Internal Revenue Service would likely declare it improper if he were audited. Share on Twitter Print This Post While Donald Trump has repeatedly said he took advantage of loopholes that allowed him to legally pay nothing in federal income taxes for decades, the New York Times reported on Monday that Trump may have actually crossed a legal boundary to avoid paying his fair share. According to the Times, the Republican nominee used a tax avoidance maneuver so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the Internal Revenue Service would likely declare it improper if he were audited. The report Tax experts who reviewed the newly obtained documents for The New York Times said Mr. Trumps tax avoidance maneuver, conjured from ambiguous provisions of highly technical tax court rulings, clearly pushed the edge of the envelope of what tax laws permitted at the time. Whatever loophole existed was not exploited here, but stretched beyond any recognition, said Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center who helped draft tax legislation in the early 1990s. Moreover, the tax experts said the maneuver trampled a core tenet of American tax policy by conferring enormous tax benefits to Mr. Trump for losing vast amounts of other peoples money  in this case, money investors and banks had entrusted to him to build a casino empire in Atlantic City. The reason that Trump bent over backward  and potentially broke laws  to avoid paying these taxes is because he was scrambling to stave off financial ruin. This is the same man who claims he would be a great president because of his successful business background. Yet, he calls himself the king of debt. His businesses have declared bankruptcy six times. He has spent decades paying zero dollars in federal income taxes. He lost a billion dollars in a single year running a casino business. Reporting out tonight even suggests that he has direct financial ties to Russia. All of this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to his business background. Even as all of this information is out there, American voters still know very little about Donald Trumps finances because he has refused to be transparent about them. And consider this What Trump is hiding in his tax returns must be much worse than the already damning information that keeps coming out through good reporting. If it werent, he would have already released them. The latest New York Times story is just the latest installment of Trumps shady business background. The media should spend the remaining week of this campaign demanding more answers from a man who wants to be in charge of the countrys pocketbook.",bias
"By Sarah Jones on Tue, Nov 1st, 2016 at 1230 am The United States District Court in New Jersey ordered discovery on Donald Trump and the RNCs poll monitoring efforts, with a hearing on November 4th, just days before the November 8th election. Share on Twitter Print This Post Republicans are being ordered to explain their comments that they will be monitoring the polls for voter fraud. The United States District Court in New Jersey ordered discovery on Donald Trump and the RNCs poll monitoring efforts, with a hearing on November 4th, just days before the November 8th election. The order demands affidavits from several parties, including from someone with personal knowledge about the defendants RNCs efforts with the Trump campaign to monitor precincts around the country, as indicated by Kellyanne Conway. Affidavits are also demanded from several Republican operatives in various states who are said to be conducting state wide voter fraud monitoring and poll monitoring, such as RNC member Rob Gleasons efforts to recruit persons to act as poll watchers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and RNC member Ronna Romney McDaniels efforts in Michigan to prepare a massive, statewide antivoter fraud effort. The RNC must also answer for Governor Mike Pences comments that the Trump campaign is working with state governments and secretaries of state to ensure ballot integrity. This is what happens when you have zero regard for election law and try to go vigilante. Rick Hasen at Election Law Blog noted that the discovery granted is pretty broad, Pretty broad discovery required in short order, with hearing on November 4. However, The judge rejected much of the discovery sought by the DNC given the time frame, but this should alone should be pretty educational on what efforts are actually going on behind the scenes. The DNC filed a lawsuit against the Republican National Committee for violating a 1982 court order intended to prevent voter intimidation over Donald Trumps claims that the election is rigged and that his supporters need to go to the polls to intimidate voters. Donald Trumps urging that his supporters go to polling places other than their own often in urban areas to watch voters is a clear violation of the consent decree and the court isnt likely to stand for it. So now discovery has been courtordered, which is just more bad news for Republicans who are already facing an uphill battle in their bid for the White House. Its exceptionally unpatriotic to try to intimidate fellow citizens from exercising their right to vote. Everyone has the right to vote free of intimidation. Dont let anyone dissuade you from voting.

"By Hrafnkell Haraldsson on Tue, Nov 1st, 2016 at 800 am Last spring...New York had to take legal action to collect 8,578 in unpaid taxes on the Trumpowned company that owns the trademark Boeing 757   We looked yesterday at Kurt Eichenwalds revelation that Donald Trump put off investigators for six months while busily destroying emails. That is hardly Trumps only misdeed, but how many people realize that Donald Trump, at this moment, has 75  SEVENTYFIVE  legal issues hanging over his head. Hes lying 20 to 35 times a day and has his followers  and with much less excuse, the mainstream media  thoroughly distracted by the Clinton email nonstory so he can divert their attention away from his own legally questionable activities. USA TODAY reported at the end of October that Just two weeks before Election Day, at least 75 of the 4,000plus lawsuits involving Trump and his businesses remain open, according to an ongoing, nationwide analysis of state and federal court records by USA TODAY. It will surprise no one, because Trump is already deadbeating on his own pollster , that One Trump case, over nonpayment of tips to caterers at Trump SoHo Hotel in New York City, is scheduled to go to trial a week before Election Day. If one thing has become clear throughout this election it is that Trump does not pay his bills. Earlier, we had covered an incident where he had declined to finish paying a Florida contractor for work it did on one of his resorts, having decided that the contractor had been paid enough, even though it wasnt the agreedupon amount. Trump got nailed by the court for 300K in attorneys fees in that case. Just a few examples from USA TODAYs investigation Trump faces significant open litigation tied to his businesses angry members at his Jupiter, Fla. golf course say they were cheated out of refunds on their dues and a former employee at the same club claims she was fired after reporting sexual harassment. Theres a fraud case brought by Trump University students who say the moguls company ripped them off for tens of thousands in tuition for a sham real estate course. Trump is also defending lawsuits tied to his campaign. A disgruntled GOP political consultant sued for 4 million saying Trump defamed her. Another suit, a class action, says the campaign violated consumer protection laws by sending unsolicited text messages. As pointed out by USA TODAYs Nick Penzenstadler and John Kelly, these lawsuits will dog Trump into the White House, should he win. He will have no immunity because he is president. And America  and the world  will be treated to the spectacle of the President of the United States having to make trip after trip to the court to settle his highly questionable personal and business affairs. There are harassment cases, sex discrimination lawsuits, fraud, unpaid bills, racist comments, defamation, cases involving Trump University. As USA TODAY notes, as recently as last springNew York had to take legal action to collect 8,578 in unpaid taxes on the Trumpowned company that owns the trademark Boeing 757 that jetted the mogul to campaign rallies across the country. And those 75 cases will likely grow. Trump has promised, after all, to sue The New York Times and each of the women  NYMag maintains an exhaustive list  who have accused him of sexual assault. USA Today says it spent six months researching court records. The exclusive analysis, they say, found an unprecedented mountain of legal battles for a presidential candidate, ranging from skirmishes with pageant contestants to multimillion dollar real estate lawsuits. The cases offer clues to the leadership style the billionaire would bring to the White House. Donald Trump claims Clinton is tainted. He claims Clintons emails are bigger than Watergate. The other day tweeted , We must not let #CrookedHillary take her CRIMINAL SCHEME into the Oval Office. #DrainTheSwamp. This comes from the man who would turn the 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue into a morality NoGo Zone. All the facts  including the new disclosures about Trumps ties to a Russian server and his potentially illegal ploy to avoid paying taxes  make it clear that if Trump the deadbeat liar drains the swamp, he will be the first one down the drain.",bias
"By Rmuse   1000 am The voter suppression tactic is right out of the GOP election rigging playbook to suppress the Black vote in North Carolina.   The following is an opinion column by R Muse Some Americans are likely aware of the psychological term projecting that roughly means a person attributes their own faults and actions onto someone else as an unconscious form of transferring guilt for ones own actions. As soon as the Republican primaries concluded, Donald Trump projected Republicans guilt for election rigging, either through vote obstruction or suppression, onto Democrats and his opponent Hillary Clinton. Republicans have been actively suppressing votes since the election of Barack Obama in 2008, and they have only ramped up their  election rigging activities over the past eight years and yet Trump accuses Democrats of election rigging as frequently as most human beings draw breath. Yesterday, the North Carolina conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People NAACP filed a lawsuit against North Carolina Republicans and demanded they put an immediate stop to the  coordinated effort to suppress the Black vote in the state . What the NAACP rightly said was that the voter suppression tactic was  right out of the GOP election rigging playbook to suppress the Black vote in the state.  The election rigging amounts to three counties in North Carolina canceling voter registration of thousands of, mostly African American, Democratic residents a week before the presidential election. The lawsuit charged election officials in Beaufort, Moore, and Cumberland counties of denying primarily African American voters eligibility to participate in democracy because their voter registration documents mysteriously were  bounced back as undeliverable.  Most of the voters whose eligibility to vote was denied and flagged for purging, such as James Edward Arthur Sr. had moved within the same county and were still legally allowed to cast ballots. Many of the purged voters lived at their  original registration address  and were victims of a  simple postal service error.  Mr. Arthur is an African American who lives in a nursing home and has voted in at least the last 14 elections in the same county he was born and raised in without issue. Arthur testified that he, like thousands of other African American Democratic voters, never received any state or county election documents informing him that his eligibility was denied, or that if he didnt attend an appeal hearing to maintain his right to vote he would be denied the right to participate in democracy. Mr. Arthur said,  If I knew my right to vote was in jeopardy, I would do whatever I could to protect it. I want and plan to vote in the upcoming election, but I am concerned that since my registration has been canceled I will not be able to cast a ballot or it will not be counted . It is what any sane human being would consider  election rigging  simply because the tricounty ploy targeted primarily African Americans who typically vote for Democrats. It is also something North Carolina Republicans have been guilty of for the past six years. According to the NAACP lawsuit, North Carolina Republicans are in violation of the National Voter Registration Act which  bans the systemic removal of voters from the rolls in the final 90 days before an election . Republican election officials State officials defended their  election rigging  and said they were justified in  purging tensofthousands  of mainly African American Democratic voters eligibility, the definition of systemic, on an individual basis. However, the NAACP also accused Republicans of conducting a coordinated mailing campaign for the sole purpose of challenging the eligibility of thousands of mainly African American voters eligibility who did not receive the mailing. One Republican who ran for a local office last year, Shane Hubers, challenged the registration of voters,the majority who are them Democrats, in Beaufort County. In one of the other counties charged in the lawsuit, Cumberland County, one  individual used returned mail to challenge the registrations of 3,951 mostly Democratic voters . In Moore County, the secretary of the local Republican Party, N. Carol Wheeldon, challenged approximately 400 mainly African American registered voters likely because they do not vote for Republicans. The lead attorney for the NAACPs lawsuit, Penda Hair, said that although she cannot yet prove there is a concerted Republican  election rigging  conspiracy  We know that in two of the counties, the people who brought the challenges had connections to the local Republican Party. We also know that the pattern of these challenges is very similar across the counties . Ms. Hair also noted that,  in Moore County the return address of a rightwing group called the Voter Integrity Project appeared on the mail that was used to challenge voters. This is a very pernicious treatment of voters , she said. It is also a deliberate act of  election rigging  by Republicans. The president of the North Carolina NAACP, Reverend Dr. William Barber said,  We are seeing the worst attempts of voter suppression here in North Carolina that weve seen since the days of Jim Crow. The Tar Heel state is ground zero in the intentional, surgical efforts to suppress the voice of voters. These attempts are a direct affront to our Constitution . The NAACP lawsuit is demanding the state reinstate all voters challenged since 2012 using this election rigging  process back on the rolls immediately. The organization also demands that the state notifies the voters that they have been reinstated as eligible voters, and allow them to cast regular ballots early or on Election Day. They have already put in a request for an emergency hearing this week to decide the case. It might be the case that the NAACPs request for a hearing may be granted especially in light of these new charges arising just days after a federal court ruled that North Carolina Republicans violated the National Voter Registration Act in yet another manner failing to add tens of thousands of voters to the rolls who registered at a DMV office over the past few years. Last Thursday U.S. District Court Judge Loretta Biggs ordered North Carolina Republicans to permit those tensofthousands of voters to cast provisional ballots. It is highly doubtful that North Carolina Republicans will obey the Federal Judges orders because they have been the recipients of several court orders over their election rigging actions that have had no effect whatsoever or the Republicans would not continue disenfranchising voters. Republicans have been on a tear to rig elections since the American people first elected Barack Obama as President, and the conservatives on the Supreme Court are ultimately guilty of conspiring with Republicans to suppress, or obstruct, the voting rights of primarily people of color because they dont support Republicans. To be perfectly clear, it is irrelevant if it is called voter suppression, obstruction, or disenfranchisement it is a deliberate attempt to rig elections. And it is only Republicans and the Koch brothers outfit the American Legislative Exchange Council ALEC, who are behind each and every attempt in Republicancontrolled states to kill democracy by doing what the Republican Party standard bearer Donald Trump is guilty of projecting rig elections.",bias
"By Hrafnkell Haraldsson   904 am The KKK newspaper features the front page full page story Make America Great Again with a big featured center photo of Donald Trump   Rachel Maddow traces the history of the postCivil War Enforcement Acts signed by President Ulysses S. Grant, including the Ku Klux Klan Act , or The Enforcement Act of 1871 17 Stat. 13, which still makes it illegal to conspire to intimidate voters. To show that the Klan Act is not vestigial but very much relevant in this election, Maddow points to the citation of this law by the Democrat Party in a whole raft of lawsuits in Nevada, Arizona, Pennsylvania and Ohio alleging voter intimidation. Maddow points out that though voter intimidation is illegal anyway, the significance of the Klan Act is that it prohibits conspiracy to prevent by force, intimidation, or threat, any citizen who is lawfully entitled to vote, from giving his support or advocacy in a legal manner, toward or in favor of the election of any lawfully qualified person as an elector for President or Vice President, or as a member of Congress of the United States. As an example of the role the KKK plays in Trumps campaign, Maddow produced the KKKs newspaper of today, which bills itself as The Political Voice of White Christian America, which, you might note, is identical with Fox News demographic. This paper, she says, has been turning up on front lawns in the great state of Georgia. Watch courtesy of MSNBC discussion begins at 915 mark Tonight we just got a hold of this disgusting development. This is the newspaper of the Ku Klux Klan today. Its The Crusader, the political voice of white Christian America. The premier voice of white resistance. Theyve got  you see the white power symbol there in the upper righthand corner Theyve got a whole media operation going on apparently. Watch white pride TV, listen to KKK radio 24 hours a day. This newsletter is about 12 pages long, features articles on the threat of nonwhite immigration, a very subtle feature on black people committing terrible crimes against white people. Theres an article by the founder of the America First Party which is all about the terrorist Jews. He brags in his byline that hes the man who David Duke credits for awakening him to the threat of Jewish supremacism. Its exactly what you would think from the Ku Klux Klan newspaper. If you knew there was a Ku Klux Klan newspaper these days. But the front page full page story is Make America Great Again with a big featured center photo of Donald Trump. Its one of several articles in the paper about Trump, including this inset article about how Trumps candidacy is moving the dialogue forward.  Those are a couple of the many, many robocalls that were made during the Republican primary campaign on behalf of Donald Trumps candidacy, calls made by a white nationalist group that calls itself the American National Super PAC. The Trump campaign doesnt appear to have anything to do with these calls. They reportedly returned a donation from the white nationalist guy who you hear on the call when it was first reported that he was making these calls and that he was a Trump donor. It was further embarrassing to the Trump campaign when this guy, this farmer and white nationalist who does these robocalls, he was initially picked to be a Trump delegate to the Republican Convention this year before his delegate status once got yanked once it was widely reported. Donald Trumps white supremacist followers have made no secret of the fact that they want a White homeland and that, of necessity, the United States must be this White homeland. As Maddow has pointed out in the past, and by their own admission, their eugenics insanity is now out in the open because of Donald Trump. Dont believe Maddow Demographics Pro looked at 10,000 Donald Trump Twitter supporters and found that more than one third follow white nationalist Twitter accounts. The fact is, Trump has mainstreamed white supremacy and by not strongly denouncing it, brought it into his own movement, which seems to be a meeting place for much more than disaffected white workingclass Americans, whatever the mainstream media tells you. The Trump campaign is a maelstrom of hate, and the KKK is right at the heart of it.",bias
"In a major omen of potential election disaster for Republicans, Donald Trump has scored the lowest rating in the history of Gallups presidential leadership poll. Gallup released their presidential leadership survey, and the results were historically bad for Donald Trump Voters rate Trump worse than any other presidential candidate in Gallups records on having the personality and leadership qualities a president should have. Previous readings were taken in late October in the 2000, 2004 and 2008 campaigns. In those years, between 52 and 61 of registered voters said the two majorparty candidates had the right personality and leadership qualities  a sharp contrast to Trumps current 32. Clintons rating of 51 is one percentage point below the previous low score. Clintons score, while low, was one point of the range for previous presidential cycles going back to 2000. Trumps score was twenty percent below the lowest score in the history of the poll. Voters arent going to elect a man to be the next president who they view as lacking the basic qualities of presidential leadership. The popular vote total in 2016 may reflect the nations political polarization, but there is a reason why electoral map projections continue to look very good for the Democratic candidate. Donald Trump has failed the most elemental test for any presidential candidate. He doesnt look, act, or behave like a person who has the qualities needed to occupy the Oval Office and lead the United States of America. The last week before election day tension that is in the air is normal, but the fundamental motivating factors of this contest havent changed. Democrats are holding on to their electoral map advantage, while Donald Trump has become the central issue and question on the ballot. Republicans look to be heading for a major ballot box disaster because voters do not believe that Donald Trump is fit to be president.",bias
"By Sarah Jones on Tue, Nov 1st, 2016 at 1148 am A veteran spy is alleging that Russia is cultivating, supporting and assisting Donald Trump and has been for at least five years. The spy said the response from the FBI was shock and horror. Share on Twitter Print This Post A veteran spy is alleging that Russia is cultivating, supporting and assisting Donald Trump and has been for at least five years. The spy said the response from the FBI was shock and horror. The report alleges that Trump and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin and that Russian intelligence claims to have compromised Trump on his visits and could blackmail him. David Corn at Mother Jones reported Mother Jones has reviewed that report and other memos this former spy wrote. The first memo, based on the former intelligence officers conversations with Russian sources, noted, Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance. It maintained that Trump and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals. It claimed that Russian intelligence had compromised Trump during his visits to Moscow and could blackmail him. It also reported that Russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on Hillary Clinton based on bugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls. The former intelligence officer says the response from the FBI was shock and horror. The FBI, after receiving the first memo, did not immediately request additional material, according to the former intelligence officer and his American associates. Yet in August, they say, the FBI asked him for all information in his possession and for him to explain how the material had been gathered and to identify his sources. The former spy forwarded to the bureau several memossome of which referred to members of Trumps inner circle. After that point, he continued to share information with the FBI. Its quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on, he says. In August, Corn reports, the FBI asked the spy for all information related to his findings and he continued to share information with the FBI which he says made it clear there was a pretty substantial inquiry going on. If this report is accurate, the spys information confirms what Senator Harry Reid says intelligence experts and FBI Director James Comey already shared with him regarding explosive information regarding ties and coordination between Donald Trump and Russia. This report also rings true given report about the Trump server repeatedly being connected to Russia, including Trumps server possibly communicating with a Russian bank. It also makes sense given the many ties to Russia within Trumps own campaign and indeed Trumps own rhetoric regarding NATO and Russia. Trump changed the Republican Party platforms proUkraine proposals and talked about weakening NATO, both of which mirrored Putins wish list. NBC reported Monday evening that the FBI is in the preliminary stages of investigating Trumps excampaign managers connection to Russia. Donald Trump has already been busted for reading Russian propaganda at his rallies, as Newsweeks Kurt Eichenwald uncovered an instance of Trump reading propaganda directly from Putin at a rally in Pennsylvania. Eichenwald pointed out something vital and that is that the Russians have been hacking into American emails and then falsifying them in hopes of impacting the presidential election, The Russians have been obtaining American emails and now are presenting complete misrepresentations of themfalsifying themin hopes of setting off a cascade of events that might change the outcome of the presidential election. The big question, of course, is why are the Russians working so hard to damage Clinton and, in the process, aid Donald Trump The answer to why Putin is trying so hard to defeat Clinton might be in multiple reports that he fears her. Unlike Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton is no pushover. According to former U.S. officials, Putin sees Clinton as a forceful proponent of regime change policies that the Russian leader considers a grave threat to his own survival. Trump has been acting like someone already groomed by the Kremlin. Hes been a willing puppet for their dangerous goal of destroying western democracy, he is easily flattered and easily manipulated. Its also easy to see how they could have gotten something on him with which to blackmail him  see the Billy Bush bus tape of Trump bragging about sexual assault. Trump is easy bait. The fact that the FBI Director felt compelled to announce something about Hillarys emails that turned out to not be about her emails but about her aides emails and even then he wasnt sure what they said or even if they were duplicates, but he chose to keep this explosive information about Donald Trumps ties to Russia under wraps is very disturbing. This isnt a matter of partisan disagreement about the rules the FBI follows about ongoing investigations. This is a matter of national security at this point if all of these reports from different sources are accurate. But the fact that they come from different sources and that Trump willingly staffed his own campaign with Russian ties and he is advocating for their dream positions and he reads their propaganda straight from the vault so to speak  these facts add up to what looks like a terrifying fire of epic proportions.",bias

Share on Twitter Print This Post Russia did hack the Democrats. So all of that email information that the media has been reporting came from a foreign entity that seeks to alter the outcome of the U.S. election. But FBI Director James Comey struggled with not wanting to appear biased as the FBI investigated Russian interference with the U.S. presidential election, and so he told the Obama administration not to accuse Russia of the DNC hackings lest they be seen as partisan. Republican FBI Director James Comey advised the Obama administration not to publicly accuse Russia of hacking the DNC and more on the grounds that it would make the administration appear unduly partisan too close to the Nov. 8 election, officials familiar with the deliberations told the Washington Post. These sources with knowledge of the internal discussions spoke to the Post on the condition of anonymity. There are a few reasons why Comey might want to keep his agencys investigation of Russian interference under the radar, but given his choice to publicly suggest that his agency might be reopening its exhaustive investigation of Clintons emails, which resulted from a Republicanled, bogus, overreaching and seemingly endless Benghazi investigation that also cleared Clinton, it seems odd that Comey was going to stay silent on the Russia matter. Comeys decisions is especially odd given the reports that the Russians have been communicating and coordinating with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to the point that he is already compromised. Only one of these matters might allow a foreign power control over the United States president. The same sources tell the Post that Comey made the decision to reveal the Clinton emails to Congress because he had already testified in that matter and said the investigation was closed, which suggests that he was concerned with his own reputation. Not sure Im buying that because if Comey really only cared about his own reputation ahead of not appearing partisan he wouldnt have said anything at all, but that doesnt mean that his motives were nefarious. There might well be good reason for this  after all, this is the FBI and they cant tell us everything, but as of right now Comey has mishandled this and appears to be trying to influence an election to help Republicans. Just because he is a Republican and just because he has donated to Republicans doesnt mean he isnt doing his job properly. But Comey has a lot of explaining to do right now. He is under fire for good reason, as the explanations hes giving for these decisions dont make sense and are contradictory.",bias

The Wisconsin Republican has said he intends to seek another term as House speaker but has rankled members of the group of several dozen Republican lawmakers that drove John Boehner out of the Speakership last year. The Freedom Caucus is also weighing proposals meant to empower its members, some at the expense of GOP leaderships authority. There have been early rumblings that Speaker Ryan may be open to making a few deals on policies like tax reform with Hillary Clinton if she wins the election. One of the reasons why these deals may never happen is because of the ability of far right Republicans to cause trouble. If Ryans Republican majority shrinks, he will be an even bigger hostage to the farright wing of his caucus. The dysfunctional dynamic in the House is going to continue even if Hillary Clinton wins the election. Ryan has run into the same hurdles that John Boehner faced. House Republicans are deeply divided and unable to agree on much of anything. The fact that the Freedom Caucus is holding a secret meeting is a sign that nothing is going to change. If Paul Ryan doesnt cave to their demands, they will force Ryan out of the Speaker position. A group of House Republicans is plotting new ways to keep the House from working properly before a new president has even been elected. This is a reminder that Washington is fine. Its the Republican Party thats broken.",bias
"By Jason Easley on Tue, Nov 1st, 2016 at 1023 pm Republicans are so far removed from reality that Sean Hannity spread a fake news story on his radio show, and nobody noticed the difference. Share on Twitter Print This Post Republicans are so far removed from reality that Sean Hannity spread a fake news story on his radio show, and nobody noticed the difference. CNN reported, The progression of events illustrates how fake news stories expand and spread from fringe web sites to nationally syndicated radio shows with millions of listeners. In this case, the fake news originated on a dubious site called Your News Wire, which publishes a mix of true, slanted and madeup news. Then, like a game of telephone, by the time the story got to Hannity, even the fake facts were wrong. Some rightwing websites spread the story, which turned into a tall tale that added new details at each stop. The fake news eventually reached The Gateway Pundit, and to Sean Hannitys radio show. After spreading the fake news to millions of listeners, Hannity downplayed his responsibility to get the facts right, Bottom line it was brought up in an insignificant way, I was dealing with more important issues like HRC crimes and lies and how CNN has been colluding with the Clinton campaign and CHEATING Bernie Sanders. Hannity was busy dealing with real fake issues like Hillary Clintons crimes and how the election is being stolen from Donald Trump. How Hannity put a fake story on the air is a perfect example of how the rightwing media echo chamber works. Nobody at any level bothered to check the facts because in the Republican Party belief has replaced fact. Conservative media knows that their audience wants confirmation of their beliefs, so that is what they provide. It doesnt matter if the confirmation is true. What matters is that the audience wants it to be true. Sean Hannity is pushing fake news, and he doesnt care. This is why there is such a disconnect between Republicans and the rest of the country. Republican voters are living in a fantasy land that Donald Trump was able to exploit and ride the whole way to the Republican nomination. The conservative media bubble is alive and well, and because of this, things will get a lot worse for Republicans before they begin to get better.",bias
"As a new poll shows 28 of early Republican Florida voters casting their vote for Clinton, Donald Trump is getting desperate. The Republican nominee begged Clinton voters to change their vote in 6 states where its not too late to do so. Trump wrote Wednesday morning, So now that you can see Hillary was a big mistake, change your vote to MAKE AMERICAN GREAT AGAIN You can change your vote in six states. So, now that you see that Hillary was a big mistake, change your vote to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN  Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump November 2, 2016 Tuesday evening Trump made the case that due to the FBIs announcement about Clintons emails voters might have buyers remorse , A lot of things have happened over the last few days. This is a message for any Democratic voters who have already cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton and are having a bad case of buyers remorse  in other words you want to change your vote  Wisconsin is one of several states where you can change your early ballot if you think youve made a mistake. While its true that people in some states can change their votes, its not true that this rule was changed because of Hillary Clintons emails and yes, thats a new Right wing thing apparently. Trump doesnt suggest the law was changed because of Clinton, but he seems to think people will be rushing to change their mind about Clinton because of the nonsurprise October surprise the Republican FBI Director delivered , which was perceived to have benefited the Trump ticket. Days ago, Snopes debunked the notion that changing early votes is being allowed because of the FBIs bizarre announcement that they may or may not have more emails pertaining to Clinton. Claim After FBI Director Jim Comey announced that he was reviewing emails potentially linked to Hillary Clinton, several states announced that they were allowing people to change their early votes. mixture WHATS TRUE Some states allow early voters to change their votes before election day. WHATS FALSE No states changed their election laws in order to allow people who voted early for Hillary Clinton to change their votes. And to make this even better, that false information was based on a Fox News report that wasnt selling the false story about Clinton, but still got some of the information wrong. This is why the Right cant have nice things. The Left should be vigilant against allowing itself to become too insular, because epistemic closure leads to losing. Trump conveniently ignores his own history of email dumping, exhaustive list of lawsuits, bragging about sexual assault, dissing minorities and a Gold Star family, and national security experts investigating his ties and his campaigns ties to Russia. Only a desperate candidate runs on trying to get people to change their votes to him because someone found a Clinton aides emails when they dont even know what they say or if they are duplicates yet. While this race is far from over, if all Americans get off their butts and go vote, Donald Trump faces an uphill battle to the White House.",bias

Share on Twitter Print This Post Speaking at Reverend Samuel Delevoe Memorial Park in Fort Lauderdale, Tuesday night, Hillary Clinton was interrupted by a Donald Trump supporter who shouted Bill Clinton is a rapist He was no doubt working for the 5,000 reward offered by InfoWars. But Clinton was having none of it. Rather than ignoring the man, she issued a stern rebuke. Stabbing her finger at the man, she said You know, I am sick and tired of the negative, dark, divisive, dangerous vision and behavior from people who support Donald Trump. The man continued to shout, waving his sign, and the crowd countered with cries of Hillary Hillary as she said, It is time for us to say no, we are not going backwards, were going forward into a brighter future. The protester was escorted out by security, and Clinton told the man, and everyone like him, You may be angry about something, but anger is not a plan. Dont be used. Dont be exploited. See the protesters antics here. Note that he was neither roughed up nor attacked by Clinton supporters Sadly, all too many angry white Christians are allowing themselves to be exploited by Donald Trump, who represents the very forces that have deprived them of the American dream, a man whom, as Clinton says, has taken everything, and given nothing.

A complaint was being filed by an anonymous woman who felt that Flowers relationship with Clinton kept her from getting the job when, the woman claimed, she was more qualified.In the audio, Clinton is heard coaching Flowers on how best to deal with the woman and subsequent questions that may arise.The sections of the audio recordings dealing with the state job were given to the news media in 1992. This came just one day after Clinton had appeared on 60 Minutes with his wife, Hillary  the current Democratic presidential nominee  blatantly denying any romantic relationship with Flowers.However, in his deposition for a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against him by Paula Jones, Clinton would eventually admit to having a sexual interaction with Flowers in 1998.

" In the past year, Americans have seen police officers ambushed and assassinated, and they have watched as the thin line protecting citizens from criminals has been reviled by groups such as Black Lives Matter.And now America is taking its stand.A new Gallup poll shows that respect for the police has hit its highest point in almost 50 years. Related Stories Video Suspect Beats Female Officer Who Didnt Use Weapon Out Of Fear Of Backlash Police Officer Issues A Moving Response To Kaepernicks Protest NBA Anthem Singer Drops To Knee During Final Line To Protest Racial Inequality The poll, taken in early October, found that 76 percent of Americans have a great deal of respect for police and another 17 percent say they have some respect.Obviously, this violent rhetoric we have seen from BLM has backfired , wrote Andrew Mark Miller on Young Conservatives.People respect the cops more than ever and they clearly see what a difficult job they have, he added. Miller said the Black Lives Matter movement denies its true purpose.And dont give me this nonsense about how BLM isnt antipolice, he wrote. In fact, many BLM supporters have been out there saying we should eliminate the police force entirely .Miller said the bottom line is clear.This poll is a repudiation of the tactics the left has used to demonize law enforcement.

Gallup began surveying Americans about the police in 1965.The 2016 poll also shows a major change in attitudes from just a year earlier. The 2015 poll showed the highest level to date of Americans lacking confidence in their police officers, at 18 percent.The increase in shootings of police coincided with highprofile incidents of law enforcement officials shooting and killing unarmed black men. Despite the flaring of racial tensions after these incidents, respect for local police has increased among both whites and nonwhites, Gallup reported in analyzing its results.The sharp increase over the past year in professed respect for local law enforcement comes as many police say they feel they are on the defensive  both politically and for their lives while they are on duty  amid heated national discussions on police brutality and shootings, it added.Gallup said future events could change the level of support enjoyed by police.Its unclear whether the spike in respect for police will have staying power or if it reflects mostly a reaction to the retaliatory killings against police officers last summer, it wrote.What do you think",bias

John McCain, the 2008 GOP nominee, each raised more overall in their respective campaigns than Trump has in total contributions.However, Trumps campaign has topped both of the former nominees in small individual contributions, defined as 200 or less.

It paid the fundraiser a 124,250 commission in 2014.Notice what happened Brocks Media Matters gave a 930,000 cash grant to Brocks Franklin Education Forum. Brocks Franklin Education Forum credited the Bonner Group for raising those funds, triggering the 12.5 percent commission. Brock paid the Bonner Group a 124,250 commission to solicit a cash grant  from himself It doesnt stop there After the Franklin Education Forum retained 869,750, it sent a 816,224 cash grant to Brocks Franklin Forum . Note The Franklin Education Forum is a 501c3, and The Franklin Forum is a 501c4. They are not the same company. The Franklin Forum 501c4 paid Bonner a commission in 2013 , so its safe to assume the fundraiser received a 102,028 commission in 2014. Unfortunately, its hard to tell for sure. It still hasnt filed its taxes for 2014Lets recap Say, for example, you donate 1,062,857 to Media Matters for America. This is how David Brock would have used your charitable donation in 2014Media Matters would receive your 1,062,857 donation. The Bonner Group would earn a 132,857 commission. Media Matters would retain 930,000. Next, Media Matters would give whats left of your entire donation , 930,000, to the Franklin Education Forum. The Bonner Group would earn a 116,250 commission. The Franklin Education Forum would retain 813,750. The Franklin Education Forum would then forward the remaining 813,750 to The Franklin Forum. The Bonner Group would earn a 101,718 commission. The Franklin Forum would retain 712,031. In the end, Brocks solicitor would have pocketed 350,825, almost a third of your initial donation. Thats a far cry from the advertised 12.5 percent commission.As bizarre as that scenario may sound, this is exactly what Brock did in 2014.How can we be sure this is intentional Brock is the chairman for each of these organizations. How could he not know whats going onHes a handson chairman. According to their tax returns, Brock allocates time, weekly, to his organizationsMedia Matters 31.50 hours per week Franklin Education Forum three hours per week The Franklin Forum one hour per week Furthermore, The New York Times reports that Brock shares a summer rental in the Hamptons with Mary Pat Bonner, the president of the Bonner Group.Brock would have a hard time claiming ignorance on this. These transfers are intentional. He vacations with his solicitor. Case closed.Still not convinced Brock didnt even bother to give his organizations different phone numbers. They all share the same number.What if  We even located the Bonner Groups solicitation agreement with Media Matters on Floridas Gift Givers Guide . Clarification on the commission can be found on page 2In English Contractually, Brock has the option to exclude certain contributions from triggering the commission. In spite of this option, he intentionally chooses to trigger the 12.5 percent commission for money grants between his organizations.Note Yes, we are making the assumption that all of Brocks organizations have the same solicitation agreement with the Bonner Group. Given that his organizations share the same address, board members and telephone number, we feel its safe to assume they also share the same solicitation agreement. This barely scratches the surface Utilizing publicfacing tax returns, along with records submitted to the Federal Election Commission, we mapped out all the significant money transfers from 2014 that took place in Brocks officeSummary This is all from just one year No further commentary required.We understand this may be hard to believe. We first came across this in July, and are still having a hard time wrapping our heads around it.All of the data referenced in this article originated from publicly accessible sources. Check for yourself  we provided links to the source material in our article exposing the organizations operating in Brocks office. These data have been sitting out in the open, gathering dust for years. If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.Weve spent months trying to find some sort of loophole to justify this activity. But there arent any loopholes. David Brock has something to hide. Just last month, The Daily Caller reported the followingBrocks former longtime livein boyfriend William Grey whom Brock has thanked in several of his books threatened to go to the IRS with damaging information about how Brock was running his Media Matters empire. What did Brock do He paid Grey 850,000 to keep quiet. Brock reportedly had to sell his home in Rehoboth, Delaware, to come up with the money. This certainly seems to indicate that Brock was terrified about what the authorities would uncover.Adding to this, Fox News reported the followingGrey accused Brock of financial malfeasance and threatened to undermine Brocks fundraising efforts.Next step is I contact all your donors and the IRS, Grey wrote in an email dated May 19, 2010. This is going to stink for you if you do not resolve this now.We believe that the information presented in this article is what has Brock so terrified. We feel confident in saying, with close to absolute certainty, that David Brock is laundering money through his Media Matters conglomerate.This article first appeared at The Citizens Audit .

" After the release of a WikiLeaks email chain from March 2015 on Tuesday in which a top Clinton aide admitted President Barack Obama falsely claimed he did not know about Hillary Clintons private server use while she was secretary of state, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest sprung into action to deny that the president had lied about the issue.What the president said was an entirely factual response, Earnest said to a group of reporters in Los Angeles where Obama was attending Democratic fundraisers.Earnest then attempted to explain away all criticism of the presidents actions as mere conspiracies. Related Stories Hannity Proposes A Sendoff For Obama In The Event Of A Trump Presidency WikiLeaks Podesta Said Obamas Dont Need To Be This Nice To President Bush And First Lady WikiLeaks Reveals Obama Knew About Clintons Emails Clean This Up I recognize that some of the presidents critics have attempted to construct some type of conspiracy about the communication between the president and the secretary of state, he said.He continued, But theyve failed to put forward a conspiracy that withstands any scrutiny, so I guess they are back to recycling thoroughly debunked conspiracies.Obama himself denied any knowledge of the server, telling CBS reporter Bill Plante in March 2015, just after the server revelations that he learned of the Clintons private email server the same time everybody else learned it through news reports. Several days after the server revelations in March 2015, Earnest told the press that Obama knew about Clintons email address and had sent messages to it but knew nothing about a private server.He reiterated that position on Tuesday.The president did trade emails with Secretary Clinton, not a large number of them, Earnest said.Of course the president had possession of Secretary Clintons email address, but he did not have any knowledge of where her server was located or what sort of arrangements had been made to store her email.

So, we have to presume that he knew that he was sending unsecured emial to HRC. The location of the server is a Red Herring. It was somewhere in cyberspace. What matters is that it was that she was using a private email account that appeared to be unsecured. The fact that it was unsecured is the major point here.

"State that fired pastor demands his sermons, notes This is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority Published 3 mins ago About   Archive Bob Unruh joined WND in 2006 after nearly three decades with the Associated Press, as well as several Upper Midwest newspapers, where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists. He is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially. Print Dr. Eric Walsh Photo First Liberty The state of Georgia is demanding copies of the sermons and related notes of a lay pastor who was fired by the Department of Public Health after it investigated what he said in his church. But Dr. Eric Walsh is resisting, issuing a statement via his legal team that he will not comply with the demand from state lawyers. The states demand is in response to a lawsuit filed by Walsh against the Department of Health charging discrimination based on his religion and other civil rights violations. Hes getting support from a pastor who successfully fought off a demand by Houston officials for copies of his sermons. Walshs ordeal began in May 2014 when he accepted an offer as to become district health director with the state agency. Only a week later, a state official asked him to provide copies of sermons he had preached as a lay minister with a Seventhday Adventist Church. Lee Rudd, the agencys human resources director, then assigned staff members to listen to the YouTube recordings immediately. Two days later, Walsh was fired. At that point, lawyers with First Liberty Institute joined forces with the Atlanta legal team of Parks, Chesin  Walbert to file a federal lawsuit against the state agency. Police State USA How Orwells Nightmare Is Becoming Our Reality chronicles how America has arrived at the point of being a de facto police state, and what led to an outofcontrol government that increasingly ignores the Constitution. Order today Now, in response to Walshs lawsuit, the state delivered a Request for Production of Documents that demands, among a flood of other paperwork, copies of his sermon notes and transcripts. This is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority and violating the sanctity of the church, said Jeremy Dys, senior counsel for First Liberty. No government has the right to require a pastor to turn over his sermons, said Walsh in a statement released by his lawyers. I cannot and will not give up my sermons unless I am forced to do so. Officials with the Georgia Department of Health declined to respond to a WND request for comment, instead referring a reporter to the state attorney general, who did not respond to a request for comment. Walshs lawyers scheduled a news conference as a display of support. On the guest list was Pastor Dave Welch of Houston, one of five pastors whose sermons were demanded by a lesbian mayor during her campaign to establish protections for her sexual preferences in city code. WND broke the story when the city launched its action against the pastors and also reported when Rush Limbaugh described Parkers actions as possibly one of the most vile, filthy, blatant violations of the Constitution that I have seen. The mayor at the time, Annise Parker, withdrew the demands amid a flood of protest . In a prepared statement Wednesday on Walshs case, Welch said, I cant believe Im saying this, but Georgias demand is even worse than when the mayor of Houston demanded 17 different categories of materials, including sermons, from  us. Welch, the executive director of the Texas Pastor Council, said what is happening to Walsh is worse than what happened in Houston for multiple reasons. First, this is state government coming after a pastor, not just a rogue mayor in one city, he said. Also, the state is demanding much more material sermons, sermon notes, all documents without even topical or time limits. It could even include margin notes in this pastors preaching Bible. Its almost as if they are ransacking the pastors study. This sweeping demand is ominous and a threat to every pastor, every church, every denomination, and every citizen of faith in America. Leaders of Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee, part of the nations largest public policy womens group with 500,000 members, also came to Walshs defense. Penny Nance, CEO, said The words of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., that, Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere, still reverberate today  especially as we witness the Gestapolike tactics of his native state. The state of Georgias blatant attack on religious freedom, as they discriminate against another pastor, Dr. Eric Walsh, is indeed a threat to every American, whatever our religious beliefs. Can there be a clearer violation of our First Amendment right to religious freedom than for the state to monitor, examine, and retaliate against a person because of the sermons they share WND reported earlier on the case brought against the state after its officials reviewed Walshs sermons and then fired him. No one in this country should be fired from their job for something that was said in a church or from a pulpit during a sermon, Dys told Fox News when the case was filed. He was fired for something he said in a sermon. If the government is allowed to fire someone over what he said in his sermons, they can come after any of us for our beliefs on anything. The original state investigation of Walshs sermons apparently was sparked by one complaint from an official with a county Democratic Party and gay activist. State officials also joked about informing Walsh of his firing. The telephone call was between Dr. Patrick ONeal, an agency official, and Kate Pfirman, an agency financial officer. The call was captured on an answering machine, which also caught their conversation after they thought they had hung up. Pfirman said And Im gonna be very  Im gonna try to come off as very cold, because I dont want to say very much. If I try to make it warm  Ive thought that through, its gonna just not  theres no warm way to say it anyway. Then there was laughter from both parties. ONeal then said to inform Walsh, Youre out, and there was another round of laughter. Its very funny, Pfirman said. The voicemail In the Houston dispute, voters ultimately soundly rejected Parkers ordinance giving gays and transgendered people special rights.",bias

"State that fired pastor demands his sermons, notes This is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority Published 5 mins ago Bob Unruh About   Archive Bob Unruh joined WND in 2006 after nearly three decades with the Associated Press, as well as several Upper Midwest newspapers, where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists. He is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially. Print Dr. Eric Walsh Photo First Liberty The state of Georgia is demanding copies of the sermons and related notes of a lay pastor who was fired by the Department of Public Health after it investigated what he said in his church. But Dr. Eric Walsh is resisting, issuing a statement via his legal team that he will not comply with the demand from state lawyers. The states demand is in response to a lawsuit filed by Walsh against the Department of Health charging discrimination based on his religion and other civil rights violations. Hes getting support from a pastor who successfully fought off a demand by Houston officials for copies of his sermons. Walshs ordeal began in May 2014 when he accepted an offer as to become district health director with the state agency. Only a week later, a state official asked him to provide copies of sermons he had preached as a lay minister with a Seventhday Adventist Church. Lee Rudd, the agencys human resources director, then assigned staff members to listen to the YouTube recordings immediately. Two days later, Walsh was fired. At that point, lawyers with First Liberty Institute joined forces with the Atlanta legal team of Parks, Chesin  Walbert to file a federal lawsuit against the state agency. Police State USA How Orwells Nightmare Is Becoming Our Reality chronicles how America has arrived at the point of being a de facto police state, and what led to an outofcontrol government that increasingly ignores the Constitution. Order today Now, in response to Walshs lawsuit, the state delivered a Request for Production of Documents that demands, among a flood of other paperwork, copies of his sermon notes and transcripts. This is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority and violating the sanctity of the church, said Jeremy Dys, senior counsel for First Liberty. No government has the right to require a pastor to turn over his sermons, said Walsh in a statement released by his lawyers. I cannot and will not give up my sermons unless I am forced to do so. Officials with the Georgia Department of Health declined to respond to a WND request for comment, instead referring a reporter to the state attorney general, who did not respond to a request for comment. Walshs lawyers scheduled a news conference as a display of support. On the guest list was Pastor Dave Welch of Houston, one of five pastors whose sermons were demanded by a lesbian mayor during her campaign to establish protections for her sexual preferences in city code. WND broke the story when the city launched its action against the pastors and also reported when Rush Limbaugh described Parkers actions as possibly one of the most vile, filthy, blatant violations of the Constitution that I have seen. The mayor at the time, Annise Parker, withdrew the demands amid a flood of protest . In a prepared statement Wednesday on Walshs case, Welch said, I cant believe Im saying this, but Georgias demand is even worse than when the mayor of Houston demanded 17 different categories of materials, including sermons, from  us. Welch, the executive director of the Texas Pastor Council, said what is happening to Walsh is worse than what happened in Houston for multiple reasons. First, this is state government coming after a pastor, not just a rogue mayor in one city, he said. Also, the state is demanding much more material sermons, sermon notes, all documents without even topical or time limits. It could even include margin notes in this pastors preaching Bible. Its almost as if they are ransacking the pastors study. This sweeping demand is ominous and a threat to every pastor, every church, every denomination, and every citizen of faith in America. Leaders of Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee, part of the nations largest public policy womens group with 500,000 members, also came to Walshs defense. Penny Nance, CEO, said The words of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., that, Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere, still reverberate today  especially as we witness the Gestapolike tactics of his native state. The state of Georgias blatant attack on religious freedom, as they discriminate against another pastor, Dr. Eric Walsh, is indeed a threat to every American, whatever our religious beliefs. Can there be a clearer violation of our First Amendment right to religious freedom than for the state to monitor, examine, and retaliate against a person because of the sermons they share WND reported earlier on the case brought against the state after its officials reviewed Walshs sermons and then fired him. No one in this country should be fired from their job for something that was said in a church or from a pulpit during a sermon, Dys told Fox News when the case was filed. He was fired for something he said in a sermon. If the government is allowed to fire someone over what he said in his sermons, they can come after any of us for our beliefs on anything. The original state investigation of Walshs sermons apparently was sparked by one complaint from an official with a county Democratic Party and gay activist. State officials also joked about informing Walsh of his firing. The telephone call was between Dr. Patrick ONeal, an agency official, and Kate Pfirman, an agency financial officer. The call was captured on an answering machine, which also caught their conversation after they thought they had hung up. Pfirman said And Im gonna be very  Im gonna try to come off as very cold, because I dont want to say very much. If I try to make it warm  Ive thought that through, its gonna just not  theres no warm way to say it anyway. Then there was laughter from both parties. ONeal then said to inform Walsh, Youre out, and there was another round of laughter. Its very funny, Pfirman said.

"Impeachmentera evidence against Bill Clinton still sealed 60,000 pages stored in locked, guarded room Published 23 mins ago DAILYCALLER  Tens of thousands of pages detailing the case for impeachment against former President Bill Clinton have remained locked away from the public for almost 20 years. Although many believe that the report issued by then Independent Counsel Ken Starr revealed the final findings of his investigation of Clinton in the late 1990s, around 60,000 pages of documents seen by only a few people describe the House Judiciary Committees case against the 42nd president. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde hired Chicago attorney and Democrat David Schippers to be the Chief Investigative Counsel to help prosecute the committees case against Clinton. Schippers described to American Family Radios Sandy Rios Friday how the evidence against Clinton was stored and studied by Congress at the time.",bias

"Print Have you ever noticed how Washington always has a plan to solve everybodys problem  except their own For the federal government, its always easy and tempting to look at problems  real or imagined  outside of the beltway and solve them from afar. You will recall, of course, how former Attorney General Eric Holder was going to stop police shootings all over America with sensitivity training, the power and force of the federal government and investigations, investigations and more investigations. Now Loretta Lynch, his successor, also known as Hillary Clintons guardian angel, is set to turn police shootings throughout America into big business and more power for Washington. Her latest pet project is assembling a national database on interactions between law enforcement and civilians, she reported this month. Accurate and comprehensive data on the use of force by law enforcement is essential to an informed and productive discussion about communitypolice relations, Lynch said. In the days ahead, the Department of Justice will continue to work alongside our local, state, tribal and federal partners to ensure that we put in place a system to collect data that is comprehensive, useful, and responsive to the needs of the communities we serve. The irony here is thick, indeed. One of Lynchs goals, she says, is to get law enforcement agencies to report more thoroughly about people who died during an interaction with them. Meanwhile, Lynch presides over the most egregious coverup of the most outrageous police shooting case I have ever seen in my life  namely the killing of Miriam Carey, a young black mother with baby in tow, who was gunned down by Washington cops and Secret Service agents for a wrong turn in the nations capital. Lynch wants reports So does WND, which has been pursuing the information through Freedom of Information Act requests and finally, after being stonewalled for years, a lawsuit. So does the public and the family of Miriam Carey. Unfortunately, Lynch is holding back on a few things Missing Evidence The 92page memo with findings, analysis of evidence and conclusions in the Carey shooting investigation. This would show the evidence and reasoning that led the Department of Justice to decline to file criminal charges against officers. Why they considered this a justifiable homicide  or whether they should have, based on the evidence. Why officers used deadly force. Whether officers followed or violated the policy of their agencies. Video of shooting at Capitol Police guard post at intersection of Constitution Ave., Maryland Ave. and 2nd Street. Only stills have been released. Video would show more clearly if officers life actually was in danger, as DOJ claimed, when he fired fatal shot to Careys head. Not one of the five witnesses at the scene said Carey was driving at the officer, as the DOJ claimed. Police statements The police report said four officers fired shots at Carey, two from the Capitol Police and two from the Secret Service. Not one statement from those officers was in the report. Their names were also redacted. Redacted information An attorney in the Washington, D.C., mayors office said the only redactions were names, in order to protect privacy. It turned out much more was redacted than names. The report was riddled with blackedout sections and missing information. 12 pages in the report were entirely blacked out. 15 pages were mostly blacked out. 22 pages were partially blacked out. Some of the blackedout pages just included a heading marked Evidence. Some just had a date. Witness statements An astonishing 38 witness accounts are missing from the police report. The police report stated There were seventytwo 72 witnesses interviewed regarding this incident and their statements were captured by audio and/or video recordings. Copies of the aforementioned recordings were turned over to the USAO for review. Copies of the aforementioned audio and video recordings are stored in the main case file at the Technical Support Unit TSU located at the IAD. Of those 72 witness statements, only 34 were in the materials provided to WND, leaving 38 missing. Statement transcripts None of the actual transcripts of interviews in the witnesses own words were provided, just paraphrased versions in what the former NYPD officer Sanders described as cop talk. White House guard post video Stills were released but not the video. It would show whether anyone was manning the post when Carey drove up whether she tried to drive around the offduty guard who dragged a gate in front of her and whether she sped off, or left at a normal speed, as a witness said. Police radio recordings No recordings or transcripts of radio transmissions during the pursuit and shooting of Carey were provided in the FOIA material. Also not provided were transcripts of computer transmissions instant messaging between squad cars and police headquarters. Ballistics and forensics reports The Justice Department Washington Metro Police Department responses to FOIA requests did not include a ballistics or a forensics report. I could go on and on. For people who want facts and reports, the U.S. Justice Department under both Holder and Lynch have a strong propensity for not willingly releasing the facts and reports to the public or the press. Weve been at this for a long time  years. Yet the stonewall and coverup of a horrendous, unjustifiable, outrageous police shooting right in their own jurisdiction and backyard continues. Do we really expect Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch to find justice for police shooting victims outside of their own jurisdiction with a track record like that Media wishing to interview Joseph Farah, please contact .

"Will it be representative government or thugocracy Exclusive Erik Rush envisions Clinton using high court as a bludgeon against liberty Published 15 mins ago Erik Rush About   Archive Erik Rush is a columnist and author of sociopolitical fare. His latest book is Negrophilia From Slave Block to Pedestal  Americas Racial Obsession. In 2007, he was the first to give national attention to the story of Sen. Barack Obamas ties to militant Chicago preacher Rev. Jeremiah Wright, initiating a media feeding frenzy. Erik has appeared on Fox News Hannity and Colmes, CNN, and is a veteran of numerous radio appearances. Print  I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy. For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of womens rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.   Hillary Clinton The first salvo from Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton or rather, her answer to the first question posed by Fox News Chris Wallace to her and Donald Trump at the third presidential debate was as chilling as it was an exemplar of hypocrisy. Those on the left are quite fond of leveling the accusation against conservatives of employing dog whistle politics, rhetoric that allegedly contains hidden or esoteric derogatory messaging which targets a specific subgroup within the opposition. Ms. Clintons response to Wallaces question where they wanted to see the Supreme Court take the country, and their views on how the Constitution ought to be interpreted however, was representative of this tactic. While womens rights and those of the LGBT community may seem to be a curious focus for the high court since objectively, women wouldnt appear to be particularly oppressed given that one has been nominated to run for president, and the LGBT community accounts for less than 5 percent of the American population, Clintons answer revealed the focus she believes the court should have once she becomes empress. Womens rights is of course dog whistle for unfettered abortion, even lateterm abortion, which is essentially infanticide via dismemberment. LGBT rights is dog whistle for disenfranchising the majority of Americans who hold traditional values, primarily Christians. Leveraging a vocal minority of homosexuals, bisexuals and transgender individuals whom the left has whipped into a froth against Christians is the methodology that was employed to negate the political power of Christians in Europe and Canada. A direct assault via legislation in this area would not work in the U.S. at least not at present however, judicial rulings could effectively bring about the same result. Let us leave aside for a moment the fact that judicial activism is unethical and skirts the Constitution and that Clintons overall objectives are manifestly evil. Hillary Clintons stated priorities for the Supreme Court are a clear indicator of her desire to use the court as a bludgeon against the Constitution and individual liberties, rather than allowing it to perform its designated function. The hypocrisy attendant to Clinton citing the rights of women and homosexuals when she is beholden via financial contributions to nations that institutionally persecute and murder members of these groups remains plain for all to see, despite being conveniently ignored by the press. Clintons reference to powerful corporations and the wealthy and the malign influence of that sinister conservative organization, Citizens United, was of course another exercise in blatant hypocrisy. Clinton is quite wealthy, and corrupt or otherwise compromised powerful corporations have been instrumental in bringing about the designs of American socialists. Even if Citizens United were a vehicle for dark, unaccountable money, the scope of its influence would pale next to the subversive designs of the Muslim Brotherhood, with which Bill and Hillary Clinton have been partnered for decades, or the myriad tentacles of organizations funded by George Soros, the former Nazi collaborator dedicated to advancing oligarchical collectivism in America, someone with whom the Clintons also have a long association. One need not attempt to decipher the thinly veiled intent behind Clintons debate rhetoric to discern what a Hillary Clinton presidency might look like. Her actions to date  and particularly those in the pursuit of seeking that office  should suffice quite nicely. Despite the craven complicity of the establishment press mainstream media, there is ample evidence for even the most indolent news consumer to reach the conclusion that she and the Democratic leviathan supporting her, and which facilitated Barack Obamas rise to power, are fundamentally malignant. In recent days, weve become aware of all manner of unethical conspiracies and outright criminality thats been brought to bear in getting Clinton elected, from Democratic officials tampering with the outcome of the illegal email server investigation, to the oversampling of key demographics in polling in order to enhance the public perception of Clintons popularity, to the recent revelation of criminally prosecutable actions on the part of the Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee and the White House. The bottom line here is that Hillary Clinton represents a class of people who transcend even the loathed archetypal modern politician in their rapaciousness and amorality. What all Americans  not just voters, and not just Republicans  need to realize is that leaders at the highest levels in the Republican Party are every bit as culpable as the gutter operatives of the Democratic Party who pay miscreants to dress up as ducks, instigate fistfights at opposition rallies and, yes, even vote for their candidates. The burning question is this In the end, are we to be governed by the will of the people, or are we going to continue pretending that we have a representative government, when we are in effect being ruled by abject thugs operating behind a faux veneer of government Media wishing to interview Erik Rush, please contact .

"While Democrats perpetually circle the wagons, Republicans engage a perpetual circular firing squad. The same holds true for many evangelicals. Democrats and secularists count on it. And we never disappoint. Full disclosure I went from a dogged Never Trumper to a Maybe Trumper and, finally, settled as a Reluctant Trumper. I, like any Godfearing father of daughters was, and remain, appalled by Donald Trumps sordid past, and his 11yearold vulgar video in which he objectified women. His words are indefensible, and I fully expect the Clinton camp to strategically release additional revolting and embarrassing opposition research about the Republican nominee before Election Day. Still, I will be voting against Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8 in what is objectively and irrefutably the most effective way possible by casting a vote, for better or worse, for the policies and promises of Donald Trump  and for the vice presidency of Gov. Mike Pence. Regrettably, with many of my Never Trump friends Im reminded of the fanatic who refuses his daughter chemotherapy and watches her die in an effort to convince himself and others of the strength of his own faith. Pride is an awful thing. We are to be wise as serpents and innocent as doves Matthew 1016. Foolishness called faith is just foolishness. Even so, there are Christian Pharisees on both extremes of this Trump fiasco first, those Trumpian cultists who buy the Make America great again pablum and deride any person who, while not casting judgment upon others, makes, with all sincerity, what they view as the principled decision. The latter say theyll sit this one out or go through the motions by voting third party  a wasted vote by any objective standard. While I appreciate this milder strain of Never Trumpers sincerity, I nonetheless believe it is sincerely wrong. And then there are the selfrighteous, plankintheeye Never Trump prigs who slander as having lost their saltiness,sinned against God and compromised their principles, brothers and sisters who recognize the empirical reality that a vote for a horribly flawed Lord knows Im the worst sinner of all baby Christian as president is a vote against Hillary Clintons tyranny in perpetuity. The Media Research Center has done America a tremendous service. In 2014 the watchdog organization released a video of an actual partial birth abortion  something Hillary Clinton stood on stage during the final presidential debate, stared into the camera with cold, callous eyes, and then both lied about and defended unequivocally. I plead with Never Trumpers to watch the video and then prayerfully reassess their plans for Nov. 8. Mrs. Clintons beloved lateterm abortion practice is one so brutal and needless that even the leftleaning American Medical Association has admitted that it is dangerous to the mother and never necessary under any circumstances, not the least of which is for the life or health of the mother. During a partialbirth abortion, the abortionist pulls a fully viable child  often kicking and thrashing  feet first from her mothers womb, leaving only the top of her head in the birth canal. This is so the abortionist can technically claim to be performing an abortion, rather than committing murder. He then stabs the child through the base of her skull with scissors, piercing her brain until her kicking and moving about suddenly and violently jerks to a halt. Next, he opens the scissors to enlarge the wound as blood and brainstem fluid gush down his hands, inserts a vacuum tube and sucks out her brains, thereby collapsing her skull. Her now limp and lifeless body is then cast away like so much garbage. This is homicide, plain and simple. Hillary Clinton supports it. Donald Trump opposes it. We deserve Gods wrath and judgment as a nation for allowing this abortion holocaust to occur on our watch. In my estimation, Mrs. Clinton is a bloodthirsty monster who enthusiastically supports this barbarity. Her Supreme Court appointees will ensure that tens of millions of precious babies like the one in the video are murdered in the same brutal manner. My conscience tells me that I must vote in such a way that exercising my civic duty will have the strongest net effect against Mrs. Clinton and ensure that she is stopped. She must not be elected president. To not vote  or to vote for a nonstarter third party candidate, which is effectively the same thing  while not an actual vote for Mrs. Clinton, still puts this Mengele in a pantsuit one step closer to the White House and the Supreme Court. Its simple math, and its undeniable. The most effective thing you can personally do as a citizen is to vote against Mrs. Clinton by voting for Mr. Trump. This does the most electoral damage possible to candidate Clinton and offers the best chance for life that you can provide future generations. With its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, the U.S. Supreme Court put the governments official stamp of approval on mass murder. Since then, the battle lines have been drawn. This is war. Prochoicers are the bad guys and prolifers, the good guys. It really is that simple  that black and white. Its good versus evil. History will reflect as much. Under a President Hillary Clinton, millions more babies will be tortured and dismembered alive. Under a President Donald Trump, these millions might live. And yet, even as Hillary sharpens her knives, we quibble like fools over Donalds potty mouth. The devil and Democrats Oh, how they love derision and division within the body of Christ.",bias
"Election crossroads Socialism or capitalism Exclusive Jane Chastain explains impact of Dems living wage proposal Published 20 mins ago Jane Chastain About   Archive Jane Chastain is a Southern Californiabased broadcaster, author and political commentator. Despite her present emphasis on politics, Jane always will be remembered as the nations first female TV sportscaster, spending 17 years on the sports beat. Jane blogs at JaneChastain.com. She is a pilot who lives on a private runway. Print Our country is at a crossroads. Never before have we faced such an obvious fork in the road. One road, the one favored by politician Hillary Clinton and her Democratic colleagues, promises to lead us to a socialist utopia. The other, favored by businessman Donald Trump and some of his Republican colleagues, promises to get us back on the road toward freemarket capitalism. It is no secret that most career politicians lean toward a socialist system. In this system they control the lions share of our money and, in turn, hand out favors. In this system, they make the major decisions that affect our lives. As the government accumulates more and more power, we invariably end up with less. Statistics show that the longer a politician stays in power, the more of our hardearned money he or she spends. Yet we keep electing the same people over and over and over again, expecting a different result. Weve been headed down the road toward socialism for quite some time, and this could be the last fork in the road we will have to get us back to the freemarket system that has given this country the highest standard of living in the world. No, it isnt perfect, but it works for everyone who is willing to work hard and wants to improve his or her life. Notice what I didnt say is simply willing to work hard. There is the belief by some that if you simply work hard, you should have what these politicians now call a living wage  the income necessary to support a family of four and supply all its basic needs, which is around 85,000 a year in some parts of the country. The Democrats want to replace the minimum wage, which is a training wage, with this living wage. That completely kicks the bottom rungs out from under the economic ladder Americans have traditionally climbed to reach their goals and live independently. Ideally, it would mean that you could take a job flipping hamburgers and never gain any skills or accept any responsibility, and live as comfortably as the guy or gal who does. Unfortunately, this socalled living wage will destroy jobs. It will cause companies to automate, and those that cannot will begin moving offshore at an even faster rate. But this living wage is only part of what the Democrats want to do in the name of fairness. This, no doubt, appeals to many in this poor economy who have lost all hope, so they are lulled into thinking that the socialist road is much better. Wages have remained flat for far too long, but the Democrats are proposing raising taxes even higher on businesses and job creators. Most people simply do not understand that businesses dont pay taxes. They are passed down to consumers in the form of higher prices. And when the price of the necessary goods and services becomes too high, such as weve seen in Obamacare, there is a large outcry. Thats when the government steps in and takes over the means of production and the control of those services. Thats when the door to socialism/communism slams shut. They tell us if we take this socialist road there is nothing to fear. Our benevolent government will take care of us. They are offering us free college  or almost free loans  in order to get the job we want at a salary we think we deserve. And if we dont get that job, the government is going to give us free health care, free food and free housing. Under President Hillary, there will be free child care, free preschool and paid family leave. What a country If we dont reach our goals, everything will be OK because Social Security and Medicare will be there to finance our retirement, and if that isnt enough, the government will put us in a retirement center where we live out the remainder of our years playing checkers or watching television. What about the fact that Social Security and Medicare are going broke How long can we keep printing money to keep us afloat before our economy collapses They never talk about that. As British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher once said, The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other peoples money. Dont be fooled This election is about a lot more than the two personalities at the top of the ticket. Its an important fork in the road One fork requires hard work and sacrifice but offers freedom. The other offers a free lunch. Media wishing to interview Jane Chastain, please contact .

"Print Before you applaud me for my integrity or condemn me for selling out, allow me to explain my decision to vote for Donald Trump on Nov. 8. First, Im writing this because I have been asked incessantly for months how I would be voting, not because I think Im someone special or that what I do should influence you. Second, Im not endorsing Donald Trump. In my mind, theres a world of difference between endorsing a candidate and voting for a candidate. Third, I respect those in the #NeverTrump camp and share many of their concerns, including the possibility of his further vulgarizing and degrading the nation, the possibility of him deepening our ethnic and racial divides, and the possibility of him alienating our allies and unnecessarily provoking our enemies, just to name a few. Among the #NeverTrump voices I respect are columnists like David French and Ben Shapiro, bloggers like Matt Walsh and evangelical leaders like Russell Moore and Beth Moore. Fourth, I take strong exception to evangelicals who have fawned over Trump as if he were some kind of savior figure, supporting him as if he were St. Donald. I also take issue with evangelical leaders who want us to minimize some of Trumps failings, constantly saying, Let him who is without sin cast the first one see John 87. This is not a question of condemning the man but rather a question of making a moral assessment as to his readiness to serve our nation. Fifth, my decision to vote for Trump, barring something earthshattering between now and Nov. 8, is consistent with my position, which has been 1 During the GOP primaries, I issued strong warnings against voting for Trump while we had other excellent choices. I did this in writing , on video and on the radio, but always stating that if Trump won the nomination, I would reevaluate my position. 2 Once Trump became the Republican candidate, I wrote that I was rooting for him to take steps in the right direction and thereby win my vote. 3 I have stated repeatedly that under no circumstances would I vote for Hillary. For two strong warnings about Hillary, see here and here . So, what has convinced me that I should now vote for Donald Trump The culture war is not over Gain hope, courage and practical advice in Michael Browns latest book, Outlasting the Gay Revolution Where Homosexual Activism Is Really Going and How to Turn the Tide First, I believe that he actually is serious about appointing prolife, proConstitution Supreme Court justices. When he said during the last debate that if youre prolife, you want to see Roe v. Wade overturned, and when he reiterated at his Gettysburg speech that he will be drawing from his list of 20 potential appointees, he helped me feel more confident that he would not suddenly flipflop if elected. Second, one reason I endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz was because he took on the political establishment, both Democratic and Republican, to the point of calling it the Washington cartel. Trump is an absolute wrecking ball to the negative parts of the political system although, unfortunately, hes been a wrecking ball to some of the good parts of the system, so my vote for him is also a protest vote. Third, I am voting for the Republican platform, not the Republican Party, which means Im in agreement with the platform while at the same time having very little confidence in the party as a whole. Fourth, while I have always felt that the line, Were electing a president, not a pastor, was overstated and superficial, if we rephrased it to say, Were electing a general to train handtohand combat warriors, not a pastor, it might have more relevance. In other words, we are not looking for Trump to be a moral reformer even if hedoes appoint righteous judges, and, at this point, he certainly is anything but a moral example although we pray he will be truly converted and become one. Rather, out of our choices for president, which are stark, we are voting for the one most likely to defeat Hillary and make some good decisions for the nation, not be the savior. And with things so messed up in America, the handtohand combat analogy is closer to home. Fifth, within the first few minutes of the last debate, the massive differences between Hillary and Trump were there for the world to see, she a proabortion radical and an extreme supporter of the LGBT agenda and he unashamedly speaking out against lateterm abortions and wanting to appoint justices who would defend our essential liberties. Since I have the opportunity to vote, I feel that I should vote for Trump. Sixth, Trump continues to be drawn to conservative Christians, and not just ones who tickle his ears. One of my dear friends has spent hours with Trump and members of his family, and he has told me that in 55 years of ministry, no one has received him as openly and graciously as has Trump. Yet my friend continues to speak the truth to him in the clearest possible terms. While I am not one of those claiming that Trump is a bornagain Christian I see absolutely no evidence of this, the fact that he continues to listen to godly men and open the door to their counsel indicates that something positive could possibly be going on. It also indicates that these godly leaders might be a positive influence on him if he were elected president. Seventh, although Im quite aware that a president could do great harm or good to the nation, Im far more concerned with what we as Gods people do with our own lives and witnesses, and for me, the state of the church of America is much more important than the state of the White House. In that context, I echo the words and warning of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The church must be reminded that it is not the master or the servant of the state, but rather the conscience of the state. It must be the guide and the critic of the state, and never its tool. If the church does not recapture its prophetic zeal, it will become an irrelevant social club without moral or spiritual authority. So, in sum 1 My hope is in God, not Donald Trump, and I do recognize that either Hillary or Trump has the potential to do great harm to America 2 My urgent call is for us as followers of Jesus to get our own act together so we can be the salt and light of the nation 3 I will continue to urge all believers not to vote for Hillary Clinton, whose policies will certainly do us great harm and 4 Ultimately, the most effective way to defeat Hillary is to vote for Trump, while also praying that God will use him for good , not for evil. In the end, if Trump gets elected and fails miserably, I will be grieved but not devastated. If he does well, I will rejoice. Either way, though, my vote is just that a vote. My greater role is to live a life pleasing to God with the hope of advancing a gospelbased moral and cultural revolution.

"Our new country Women and minorities hit hardest Ann Coulter Dems import cultures where rape, incest and spousal murder are acceptable Published 24 mins ago  Receive Ann Coulters alerts in your email BONUS By signing up for Ann Coulters alerts, you will also be signed up for news and special offers from WND via email. error Print Every ethnic group except whites blocvotes for the Democrats. Coincidentally, the Democrats have brought in another 30 to 40 million nonwhite immigrants in the last few decades. It doesnt help that white voters cant agree on what constitutes an acceptable candidate. In 2012, workingclass whites sat out the election, rather than vote for the outoftouch rich guy they saw in Mitt Romney. This year, the outoftouch rich guys say theyll vote for Hillary because Trump is tacky and gross. The sad irony is that the only people who will be better off in our new country are mostly white plutocrats  the top .01 percent. The rest of us will be their servants. The people who will be worse off are everybody else  the working class, the middle class who will soon be working class and, most of all, women, minorities, children, the elderly, the weakest and most vulnerable members of society. Look to Mexico for your future  or any Third World country. Or to Univisions Jorge Ramos. The ruling class in Mexico is composed of Europeanlooking, white descendants of Spanish conquistadors who raped the native population, giving them only their Spanish names in return. British settlers in America brought women with them. Explaining Latino cultures acceptance of incest and child rape, criminal justice researcher Shana Maier writes in a book about rape that the male is the head of the household, and women are subordinate to men.  Hispanics and Latinos are more likely than other racial/ethnic groups to blame the victim. The victim, not the perpetrator, is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family. One American detective said that, today, police are being taught to keep an open mind about child rape because its a cultural thing. When it comes to multiculturalism, you cant say, We love the empanadas  but we dont want 40yearold men raping their nieces . This isnt an a la carte menu. We get ALL the attributes of the cultures were importing. As described in excruciating detail in Adios, America The Lefts Plan to Turn Our Country into a Third World Hellhole, our media already have a totally open mind about incest and child rape  and murder  when its committed by immigrants. Thus, for example, where I would have chosen the headline Illegal Alien Convicted of Incest, Child Rape, the Chattanooga Tenn. Times Free Press went with the less catchy Man guilty in case of human smuggling. And where I would have used the headline, Illegal Alien Repeatedly Raped 14yearold Girl at Job Site, the Commercial Dispatch in Columbus, Mississippi, went with the more subtle, Columbus resident charged with molestation. Immigrant women arrive in America, thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape, incest and spousal murder are acceptable, only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country, too  provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled. In 1989, Brooklyn Judge Edward Pincus sentenced a Chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife, on the grounds that the murder flowed from traditional Chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood. The female head of the AsianAmerican Legal Defense and Education Fund, Margaret Fung, applauded the ruling. Somewhat amazingly, newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime. Anything to keep the Third World immigration flowing In 2013, a 13yearold girl was gangraped by about a dozen illegal aliens, who cheered and videoed the attack. When the news first broke, Shaneequa Jupiter, who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred, complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger. That could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants Even if Shaneequa had scoured the headlines, she would have been on the lookout for Austin men. Or Two. Compare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack  Two held in attack on child  Austin AmericanStatesman Texas, July 19, 2013  Two Mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over fiveday gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack  Daily Mail Online, July 24, 2013 Needless to say, the New York Times did not cover the Mexican illegalalien gang rape at all. The ultimate primer on the bluecollar billionaire order Ann Coulters book In Trump We Trust E Pluribus Awesome By contrast, the Times, and every major American news outlet, extensively covered another gang rape  of a girl about the same age, at about the same time, in about the same place. The second case only was rape because of the girls young age  she was 11. But she was an enthusiastic participant, sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex. Those rapes, just a few years earlier, got a fullcourt press. The defendants were AfricanAmerican. The victim was Mexican. That time, there were articles in the Huffington Post, GQ, Slate, Salon and Mother Jones. It even made the New York Times, despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team. Similarly, within a few months of one another in 2013, two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in Decatur, Alabama, for assaults on 9yearold girls. One suspect was AfricanAmerican, the other was a Hispanic immigrant. Only one made the newspaper. Guess which one When excitable Muslims raped American reporter Lara Logan in Tahrir Square another one of Hillarys foreign policy successes, journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the Muslim rapists to white American men. Conclusion The real problem was the female reporters American bosses and colleagues. Definitely not Islam Sampling of New York Times commentary on Logans rape  Why We Need Women in War Zones I would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened.  This attack also had nothing to do with Islam.  Reporting While Female Women reporters face another set of challenges. We are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not.  In my experience, Muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment. Perhaps American men could do better, but, as American women may soon discover They never had it so good. Manifestly, the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help Americans  or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like America. They are designed to funnel welfaredependent voters to the Democrats and cheap labor to the rich. The Chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife, for example, came to America based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher. Our country will be Zimbabwe, but  if all goes according to the Democrats plan  theyll get to be Mugabe Thats Hillarys dream. If she wins, Joe Sobrans parody of the typical New York Times headline about anything will come true Women and Minorities Hit Hardest.

"Trump vs. Clinton A risk vs. a disaster Larry Elder Hillary has never been asked by anyone in media about Juanita Broaddrick Published 26 mins ago  Receive Larry Elders alerts in your email BONUS By signing up for Larry Elders alerts, you will also be signed up for news and special offers from WND via email. error Print Two weeks left to go in the election and the electorate feels like a battered NFL fan. The game gets increasingly old and tiring to watch, and playing it can inflict permanent brain damage. Democrats can be counted upon to call the Republican opponent racist, whether the opponent is the priestly Mitt Romney or the Supreme Court justice who wrote the Dred Scott decision. Donald Trump, you see, is racist because, among other reasons, at a campaign stop he pointed to a black man and called him my AfricanAmerican. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, is not antiSemitic, even though three witnesses, one of whom took and passed a polygraph, claim that she referred to her husbands former congressional campaign manager as a fing Jew bastard. With a Republican candidate, the media can be counted upon to seize upon any deficiencies  big or small, real or imagined  while giving the Democrat a pass. So Trumps failure to ever apologize outweighs an examination of Clintons flatout lie during the third debate when she insisted that the Supreme Court Heller case was about toddlers, as opposed to the fundamental issue of whether the Second Amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear arms. In Heller, nowhere in the majority decision or in any of the dissenting decisions does the word toddler appear. Clinton, a year ago, flatout said, The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment. To normal people, this meant she opposed what the decision ruled on, which, again, was whether we, as individuals, have a right to keep and bear arms. Meanwhile, we learn more and more about what the media labels an email scandal, when the accurate description is national security scandal. The Espionage Act criminalizes gross negligence in the handling of important national security matters. The law does not require, as FBI Director James Comey falsely stated, an intent. Nor is it relevant, as Clinton insists, whether or not her private server, the one she maintained in her basement, was hacked. Five people who worked with or for Clinton, including her chief of staff, all received immunity deals, something normally given to get someone to flip on a target. Some of the five were involved in deleting emails after the emails were subpoenaed. But the target, that is to say Hillary Clinton, was deemed by Comey to have lacked sufficient criminal intent to be prosecuted. So why the immunity deals Who knows  and as far as most of the media are concerned, who cares Clinton insists that President Obama doesnt get enough credit for the swell job he did with the economy. This would be the economy in which, for the first time in history, a president has presided over a recovery without a single year of at least 3 percent growth in gross domestic product. This would be the same economy with an alleged low unemployment number that Gallup CEO Jim Clifton calls the big lie, given the large number of people who simply abandoned the job hunt or are underemployed. Meanwhile, its yet another day in which another woman who alleges she was kissed, groped, touched, or made fun of by Trump has appeared with her attorney, feminist Gloria Allred. Allred, a Clinton supporter, sees no contradiction between representing alleged victims of Trumps sexual misconduct and her support for Clinton, who is alleged to have hired private detectives and lawyers to dig up dirt on her husbands accusers. One such accuser, Juanita Broaddrick, claims not only that she was raped by Bill Clinton but also that two weeks after the alleged rape, Hillary Clinton verbally threatened her. Hillary Clinton, mind you, has never been asked by anyone in the media about Broaddricks allegation. Never. And only one national reporter, Sam Donaldson, has ever asked Bill Clinton about Juanita Broaddricks allegation. Ever. Clintons answer He referred Donaldson to his lawyer, David Kendall. Donaldson quickly tried again, asking the thenpresident to simply deny it. Same answer My attorney  speaks for me. And that was that. So Hillary Clinton is a candidate who wants to continue the same policy thats given us the worst recovery since 1949 who has clearly violated the Espionage Act and placed the nations security at risk who told the Benghazi victims families that the death of four Americans was inspired by a video, while telling her daughter and foreign officials something entirely different whose charitable foundation engaged in paytoplay in Haiti, so that donors got contracts for disaster relief and nondonors went to the back of the line who wants to gut the Second Amendment who wants to continue the same foreign policies that that have encouraged aggressiveness on the part of ISIS, Russia and the Chinese and whose media compadres, including scribes with the New York Times, Washington Post and CNBC, have been outed by WikiLeaks as colluding with her campaign. And she is now oddson favorite to become the next president of the United States.

"Clinton transmitted classified info to her lawyers Andrew McCarthy Theres no attorney exception to criminal law that prohibits such action Published 27 mins ago National Review  What was the legal rationale under which Hillary Clinton quite intentionally shared classified information with her lawyers, including David Kendall, Cheryl Mills, and Heather Samuelson As I outlined in last weekends column, we know that Clintons emails were replete with classified information. According to the FBI, the classified emails included intelligence graded at the most closely guarded level eight topsecret emails, and seven designated as special access program SAP information. While FBI director James Comeys presentation understandably left this vague, the likelihood is that seven of the eight topsecret emails are SAP. Under President Bill Clintons 1995 executive order, topsecret intelligence is information the mishandling of which could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security. The SAP designation is added when the unauthorized disclosure of intelligence could compromise critical intelligencegathering methods or imperil the lives of intelligence sources. That is why access to this information is so tightly restricted, and its unauthorized disclosure is routinely prosecuted.",bias
"Print Sidebyside of Bill Clinton and Danney Williams NEW YORK YouTube on Wednesday suspended the account of Danney Williams, the 30yearold who has claimed since the 1990s to be the black son of former President Bill Clinton. YouTube, citing repeated or severe violations of our Terms of Use and/or Community Guidelines, declared the account cannot be restored. The YouTube decision blocked the nineminute feature BANISHED  The Untold Story of Danney Williams, which had received 1.2 million views since Williams posted it last week. Produced by filmmaker Joel Gilbert, it drew nearly 100,000 views per day and more than 1,000 viewer comments, with the overwhelming majority expressing support for Williams and outrage at the Clintons for not being willing to allow a DNA test to determine paternity. Like the reporting you see here Sign up for free news alerts from WND.com, Americas independent news network. My YouTube account has been deleted, but the same video appears in 50 other places on YouTube alone, Williams said on his Facebook page after being notified of YouTubes decision. YouTube cant handle the truth Please share #BillClintonSon. Twitter also continues to allow Williams to post the Banished video on Danney Williams page , but the Twitter link to YouTube displays the message  This video is no longer available because the YouTube account associated with this video has been terminated. Sorry about that. The video is still running on Danney WilliamsClintons Facebook page , as well as on the YouTube channel operated by Gilbert. Attempt to silence Danney Williams Gilbert told WND he helped Williams file an online appeal form on YouTube asking why the account was suspended and demanding it be immediately reinstated. The behavior of YouTube/Google in suspending Danneys account is outrageous There have been absolutely zero violations of any kind let alone a severe one of any YouTube terms or guidelines, Gilbert said. Gilbert was outspoken in charging YouTube with partisan political motives for the suspension. The only possible explanation is that the Clinton campaign requested YouTube/Google to silence Danney, to run him off the plantation as Danney said Hillary Clinton did to him and his aunt when he was a small child and they were chased off the grounds of the Arkansas governors mansion in 1990, Gilbert said. Danney cannot be silenced any longer, he continued. Hillary may try to sweep Danney Williams under the rug, but its not going to work this time. His story is out there, and every day more and more people understand Bill and Hillary Clinton banished this young man from their family because of the color of his skin. See the Danney Williams video feature WND reported Oct. 19 that in the hours before the third and final presidential debate, attorneys for Williams were in Las Vegas to announce their intention to file a paternity suit demanding DNA evidence from the former president. Accompanying the dramatic announcement was a rap music video celebrating Williams that went viral on the Internet. No definitive DNA test WND reported that no DNA test was conducted in 1999, despite media reports to the contrary when Williams claim first surfaced. Clinton defenders since 1999 have contended the tabloid Star Magazine conducted a DNA showdown proving Bill Clinton was not Williams father, citing Star Magazine editor Phil Bunton saying at the time, There was no match, nothing even close. But in an interview, Bunton told WND that no blood sample was obtained from Clinton and Star Magazine never published a story documenting a laboratory test. I dont remember ever seeing any laboratory test that was done on Clintons DNA, Bunton told WND. Bunton is now the owner of the Rivertown Magazine in Haverstraw, New York. He affirmed to WND that the tabloid relied on the DNA evidence for Clinton published by independent counsel Kenneth Starr, extracted from the infamous Monica Lewinsky blue dress. We got a lot of phone calls from several people in the media, including the New York Times, wanting to know when we were going to get the DNA back, Bunton recalled to WND. We thought it was going to turn out to be his son, but when the DNA came back there was no story there even to write. The DNA test released by Kenneth Starr was the second of two DNA laboratory tests the FBI had run on Clinton, but the public record leaves no doubt that Starr withheld the more robust test conducted by the FBI. Twitter rules Many other figures who have challenged the Democratic Party or the leftleaning media narrative also have run into trouble with social media outlets, including James OKeefe and his Project Veritas, which has exposed Clinton campaign voter fraud and agitation in a series of hiddencamera videos. Just as OKeefe was preparing to release new revelations of voter fraud Oct. 13, Twitter shut down his account , claiming violations of Twitter Rules. The notice said he must delete the tweets that are in violation of our rules, which prohibit harassing other users, threatening other users, disclosing other users private information or violating other rules. In a statement, OKeefe said he relies on social media to bypass the media and directly reach the public. On Monday, OKeefe wrote in a tweet Project Veritas was unable to upload its third video in the series to YouTube, calling the apparent block bizarre. Earlier this month, OKeefe was forced to delete a tweet critical of a Hillary Clinton staffer to regain use of his account after it was suspended for a day. His account was suspended in the hours before a release of a new hiddencamera video that exposed a Clinton ally saying she could use executive action on guns, the Daily Caller reported . Project Veritas posted an undercover video Oct. 17 proving Hillary Clinton supporters were inciting violence at Donald Trump rallies to gain negative media coverage. Millions of viewers watched the video in just a few hours, but it didnt show up on Googles trending list on YouTube, which Google owns, noted SilenceisConsent.net . It did, however, trend on Twitter, which Google does not own. Breitbart blogger Milo Yiannopoulos was suspended permanently by Twitter minutes before his Gays for Trump party at the Republican National Convention. For some 11 months, the makers of the new movie Im Not Ashamed, about the first victim of the Columbine killers in Colorado in 1999, were unable to promote their movie through YouTube. The trailer was taken down late in 2015, and the movies entire channel was suspended . Among the conservatives censored by Facebook  Conservative activist and Trump supporter Lauren Southern received a 30day ban from Facebook because she complained about a friends account being censored. Facebook locked a 12yearold black middle schoolers account for posting a video supporting Rudy Giulianis comment that Obama doesnt love America. The admin of a proTrump group was banned for saying Trump is not antiMuslim, but antiISIS.",bias
"Print Have you ever noticed how Washington always has a plan to solve everybodys problem  except their own For the federal government, its always easy and tempting to look at problems  real or imagined  outside of the beltway and solve them from afar. You will recall, of course, how former Attorney General Eric Holder was going to stop police shootings all over America with sensitivity training, the power and force of the federal government and investigations, investigations and more investigations. Now Loretta Lynch, his successor, also known as Hillary Clintons guardian angel, is set to turn police shootings throughout America into big business and more power for Washington. Her latest pet project is assembling a national database on interactions between law enforcement and civilians, she reported this month. Accurate and comprehensive data on the use of force by law enforcement is essential to an informed and productive discussion about communitypolice relations, Lynch said. In the days ahead, the Department of Justice will continue to work alongside our local, state, tribal and federal partners to ensure that we put in place a system to collect data that is comprehensive, useful, and responsive to the needs of the communities we serve. The irony here is thick, indeed. One of Lynchs goals, she says, is to get law enforcement agencies to report more thoroughly about people who died during an interaction with them. Meanwhile, Lynch presides over the most egregious coverup of the most outrageous police shooting case I have ever seen in my life  namely the killing of Miriam Carey, a young black mother with baby in tow, who was gunned down by Washington cops and Secret Service agents for a wrong turn in the nations capital. Lynch wants reports So does WND, which has been pursuing the information through Freedom of Information Act requests and finally, after being stonewalled for years, a lawsuit. So does the public and the family of Miriam Carey. Unfortunately, Lynch is holding back on a few things Missing Evidence The 92page memo with findings, analysis of evidence and conclusions in the Carey shooting investigation. This would show the evidence and reasoning that led the Department of Justice to decline to file criminal charges against officers. Why they considered this a justifiable homicide  or whether they should have, based on the evidence. Why officers used deadly force. Whether officers followed or violated the policy of their agencies. Video of shooting at Capitol Police guard post at intersection of Constitution Ave., Maryland Ave. and 2nd Street. Only stills have been released. Video would show more clearly if officers life actually was in danger, as DOJ claimed, when he fired fatal shot to Careys head. Not one of the five witnesses at the scene said Carey was driving at the officer, as the DOJ claimed. Police statements The police report said four officers fired shots at Carey, two from the Capitol Police and two from the Secret Service. Not one statement from those officers was in the report. Their names were also redacted. Redacted information An attorney in the Washington, D.C., mayors office said the only redactions were names, in order to protect privacy. It turned out much more was redacted than names. The report was riddled with blackedout sections and missing information. 12 pages in the report were entirely blacked out. 15 pages were mostly blacked out. 22 pages were partially blacked out. Some of the blackedout pages just included a heading marked Evidence. Some just had a date. Witness statements An astonishing 38 witness accounts are missing from the police report. The police report stated There were seventytwo 72 witnesses interviewed regarding this incident and their statements were captured by audio and/or video recordings. Copies of the aforementioned recordings were turned over to the USAO for review. Copies of the aforementioned audio and video recordings are stored in the main case file at the Technical Support Unit TSU located at the IAD. Of those 72 witness statements, only 34 were in the materials provided to WND, leaving 38 missing. Statement transcripts None of the actual transcripts of interviews in the witnesses own words were provided, just paraphrased versions in what the former NYPD officer Sanders described as cop talk. White House guard post video Stills were released but not the video. It would show whether anyone was manning the post when Carey drove up whether she tried to drive around the offduty guard who dragged a gate in front of her and whether she sped off, or left at a normal speed, as a witness said. Police radio recordings No recordings or transcripts of radio transmissions during the pursuit and shooting of Carey were provided in the FOIA material. Also not provided were transcripts of computer transmissions instant messaging between squad cars and police headquarters. Ballistics and forensics reports The Justice Department Washington Metro Police Department responses to FOIA requests did not include a ballistics or a forensics report. I could go on and on. For people who want facts and reports, the U.S. Justice Department under both Holder and Lynch have a strong propensity for not willingly releasing the facts and reports to the public or the press. Weve been at this for a long time  years. Yet the stonewall and coverup of a horrendous, unjustifiable, outrageous police shooting right in their own jurisdiction and backyard continues. Do we really expect Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch to find justice for police shooting victims outside of their own jurisdiction with a track record like that Media wishing to interview Joseph Farah, please contact .

"Will it be representative government or thugocracy Exclusive Erik Rush envisions Clinton using high court as a bludgeon against liberty Published 43 mins ago About   Archive Erik Rush is a columnist and author of sociopolitical fare. His latest book is Negrophilia From Slave Block to Pedestal  Americas Racial Obsession. In 2007, he was the first to give national attention to the story of Sen. Barack Obamas ties to militant Chicago preacher Rev. Jeremiah Wright, initiating a media feeding frenzy. Erik has appeared on Fox News Hannity and Colmes, CNN, and is a veteran of numerous radio appearances. Print  I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy. For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of womens rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.   Hillary Clinton The first salvo from Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton or rather, her answer to the first question posed by Fox News Chris Wallace to her and Donald Trump at the third presidential debate was as chilling as it was an exemplar of hypocrisy. Those on the left are quite fond of leveling the accusation against conservatives of employing dog whistle politics, rhetoric that allegedly contains hidden or esoteric derogatory messaging which targets a specific subgroup within the opposition. Ms. Clintons response to Wallaces question where they wanted to see the Supreme Court take the country, and their views on how the Constitution ought to be interpreted however, was representative of this tactic. While womens rights and those of the LGBT community may seem to be a curious focus for the high court since objectively, women wouldnt appear to be particularly oppressed given that one has been nominated to run for president, and the LGBT community accounts for less than 5 percent of the American population, Clintons answer revealed the focus she believes the court should have once she becomes empress. Womens rights is of course dog whistle for unfettered abortion, even lateterm abortion, which is essentially infanticide via dismemberment. LGBT rights is dog whistle for disenfranchising the majority of Americans who hold traditional values, primarily Christians. Leveraging a vocal minority of homosexuals, bisexuals and transgender individuals whom the left has whipped into a froth against Christians is the methodology that was employed to negate the political power of Christians in Europe and Canada. A direct assault via legislation in this area would not work in the U.S. at least not at present however, judicial rulings could effectively bring about the same result. Let us leave aside for a moment the fact that judicial activism is unethical and skirts the Constitution and that Clintons overall objectives are manifestly evil. Hillary Clintons stated priorities for the Supreme Court are a clear indicator of her desire to use the court as a bludgeon against the Constitution and individual liberties, rather than allowing it to perform its designated function. The hypocrisy attendant to Clinton citing the rights of women and homosexuals when she is beholden via financial contributions to nations that institutionally persecute and murder members of these groups remains plain for all to see, despite being conveniently ignored by the press. Clintons reference to powerful corporations and the wealthy and the malign influence of that sinister conservative organization, Citizens United, was of course another exercise in blatant hypocrisy. Clinton is quite wealthy, and corrupt or otherwise compromised powerful corporations have been instrumental in bringing about the designs of American socialists. Even if Citizens United were a vehicle for dark, unaccountable money, the scope of its influence would pale next to the subversive designs of the Muslim Brotherhood, with which Bill and Hillary Clinton have been partnered for decades, or the myriad tentacles of organizations funded by George Soros, the former Nazi collaborator dedicated to advancing oligarchical collectivism in America, someone with whom the Clintons also have a long association. One need not attempt to decipher the thinly veiled intent behind Clintons debate rhetoric to discern what a Hillary Clinton presidency might look like. Her actions to date  and particularly those in the pursuit of seeking that office  should suffice quite nicely. Despite the craven complicity of the establishment press mainstream media, there is ample evidence for even the most indolent news consumer to reach the conclusion that she and the Democratic leviathan supporting her, and which facilitated Barack Obamas rise to power, are fundamentally malignant. In recent days, weve become aware of all manner of unethical conspiracies and outright criminality thats been brought to bear in getting Clinton elected, from Democratic officials tampering with the outcome of the illegal email server investigation, to the oversampling of key demographics in polling in order to enhance the public perception of Clintons popularity, to the recent revelation of criminally prosecutable actions on the part of the Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee and the White House. The bottom line here is that Hillary Clinton represents a class of people who transcend even the loathed archetypal modern politician in their rapaciousness and amorality. What all Americans  not just voters, and not just Republicans  need to realize is that leaders at the highest levels in the Republican Party are every bit as culpable as the gutter operatives of the Democratic Party who pay miscreants to dress up as ducks, instigate fistfights at opposition rallies and, yes, even vote for their candidates. The burning question is this In the end, are we to be governed by the will of the people, or are we going to continue pretending that we have a representative government, when we are in effect being ruled by abject thugs operating behind a faux veneer of government Media wishing to interview Erik Rush, please contact .

"While Democrats perpetually circle the wagons, Republicans engage a perpetual circular firing squad. The same holds true for many evangelicals. Democrats and secularists count on it. And we never disappoint. Full disclosure I went from a dogged Never Trumper to a Maybe Trumper and, finally, settled as a Reluctant Trumper. I, like any Godfearing father of daughters was, and remain, appalled by Donald Trumps sordid past, and his 11yearold vulgar video in which he objectified women. His words are indefensible, and I fully expect the Clinton camp to strategically release additional revolting and embarrassing opposition research about the Republican nominee before Election Day. Still, I will be voting against Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8 in what is objectively and irrefutably the most effective way possible by casting a vote, for better or worse, for the policies and promises of Donald Trump  and for the vice presidency of Gov. Mike Pence. Regrettably, with many of my Never Trump friends Im reminded of the fanatic who refuses his daughter chemotherapy and watches her die in an effort to convince himself and others of the strength of his own faith. Pride is an awful thing. We are to be wise as serpents and innocent as doves Matthew 1016. Foolishness called faith is just foolishness. Even so, there are Christian Pharisees on both extremes of this Trump fiasco first, those Trumpian cultists who buy the Make America great again pablum and deride any person who, while not casting judgment upon others, makes, with all sincerity, what they view as the principled decision. The latter say theyll sit this one out or go through the motions by voting third party  a wasted vote by any objective standard. While I appreciate this milder strain of Never Trumpers sincerity, I nonetheless believe it is sincerely wrong. And then there are the selfrighteous, plankintheeye Never Trump prigs who slander as having lost their saltiness,sinned against God and compromised their principles, brothers and sisters who recognize the empirical reality that a vote for a horribly flawed Lord knows Im the worst sinner of all baby Christian as president is a vote against Hillary Clintons tyranny in perpetuity. The Media Research Center has done America a tremendous service. In 2014 the watchdog organization released a video of an actual partial birth abortion  something Hillary Clinton stood on stage during the final presidential debate, stared into the camera with cold, callous eyes, and then both lied about and defended unequivocally. I plead with Never Trumpers to watch the video and then prayerfully reassess their plans for Nov. 8. Mrs. Clintons beloved lateterm abortion practice is one so brutal and needless that even the leftleaning American Medical Association has admitted that it is dangerous to the mother and never necessary under any circumstances, not the least of which is for the life or health of the mother. During a partialbirth abortion, the abortionist pulls a fully viable child  often kicking and thrashing  feet first from her mothers womb, leaving only the top of her head in the birth canal. This is so the abortionist can technically claim to be performing an abortion, rather than committing murder. He then stabs the child through the base of her skull with scissors, piercing her brain until her kicking and moving about suddenly and violently jerks to a halt. Next, he opens the scissors to enlarge the wound as blood and brainstem fluid gush down his hands, inserts a vacuum tube and sucks out her brains, thereby collapsing her skull. Her now limp and lifeless body is then cast away like so much garbage. This is homicide, plain and simple. Hillary Clinton supports it. Donald Trump opposes it. We deserve Gods wrath and judgment as a nation for allowing this abortion holocaust to occur on our watch. In my estimation, Mrs. Clinton is a bloodthirsty monster who enthusiastically supports this barbarity. Her Supreme Court appointees will ensure that tens of millions of precious babies like the one in the video are murdered in the same brutal manner. My conscience tells me that I must vote in such a way that exercising my civic duty will have the strongest net effect against Mrs. Clinton and ensure that she is stopped. She must not be elected president. To not vote  or to vote for a nonstarter third party candidate, which is effectively the same thing  while not an actual vote for Mrs. Clinton, still puts this Mengele in a pantsuit one step closer to the White House and the Supreme Court. Its simple math, and its undeniable. The most effective thing you can personally do as a citizen is to vote against Mrs. Clinton by voting for Mr. Trump. This does the most electoral damage possible to candidate Clinton and offers the best chance for life that you can provide future generations. With its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, the U.S. Supreme Court put the governments official stamp of approval on mass murder. Since then, the battle lines have been drawn. This is war. Prochoicers are the bad guys and prolifers, the good guys. It really is that simple  that black and white. Its good versus evil. History will reflect as much. Under a President Hillary Clinton, millions more babies will be tortured and dismembered alive. Under a President Donald Trump, these millions might live. And yet, even as Hillary sharpens her knives, we quibble like fools over Donalds potty mouth. The devil and Democrats Oh, how they love derision and division within the body of Christ.",bias
"Election crossroads Socialism or capitalism Exclusive Jane Chastain explains impact of Dems living wage proposal Published 49 mins ago About   Archive Jane Chastain is a Southern Californiabased broadcaster, author and political commentator. Despite her present emphasis on politics, Jane always will be remembered as the nations first female TV sportscaster, spending 17 years on the sports beat. Jane blogs at JaneChastain.com. She is a pilot who lives on a private runway. Print Our country is at a crossroads. Never before have we faced such an obvious fork in the road. One road, the one favored by politician Hillary Clinton and her Democratic colleagues, promises to lead us to a socialist utopia. The other, favored by businessman Donald Trump and some of his Republican colleagues, promises to get us back on the road toward freemarket capitalism. It is no secret that most career politicians lean toward a socialist system. In this system they control the lions share of our money and, in turn, hand out favors. In this system, they make the major decisions that affect our lives. As the government accumulates more and more power, we invariably end up with less. Statistics show that the longer a politician stays in power, the more of our hardearned money he or she spends. Yet we keep electing the same people over and over and over again, expecting a different result. Weve been headed down the road toward socialism for quite some time, and this could be the last fork in the road we will have to get us back to the freemarket system that has given this country the highest standard of living in the world. No, it isnt perfect, but it works for everyone who is willing to work hard and wants to improve his or her life. Notice what I didnt say is simply willing to work hard. There is the belief by some that if you simply work hard, you should have what these politicians now call a living wage  the income necessary to support a family of four and supply all its basic needs, which is around 85,000 a year in some parts of the country. The Democrats want to replace the minimum wage, which is a training wage, with this living wage. That completely kicks the bottom rungs out from under the economic ladder Americans have traditionally climbed to reach their goals and live independently. Ideally, it would mean that you could take a job flipping hamburgers and never gain any skills or accept any responsibility, and live as comfortably as the guy or gal who does. Unfortunately, this socalled living wage will destroy jobs. It will cause companies to automate, and those that cannot will begin moving offshore at an even faster rate. But this living wage is only part of what the Democrats want to do in the name of fairness. This, no doubt, appeals to many in this poor economy who have lost all hope, so they are lulled into thinking that the socialist road is much better. Wages have remained flat for far too long, but the Democrats are proposing raising taxes even higher on businesses and job creators. Most people simply do not understand that businesses dont pay taxes. They are passed down to consumers in the form of higher prices. And when the price of the necessary goods and services becomes too high, such as weve seen in Obamacare, there is a large outcry. Thats when the government steps in and takes over the means of production and the control of those services. Thats when the door to socialism/communism slams shut. They tell us if we take this socialist road there is nothing to fear. Our benevolent government will take care of us. They are offering us free college  or almost free loans  in order to get the job we want at a salary we think we deserve. And if we dont get that job, the government is going to give us free health care, free food and free housing. Under President Hillary, there will be free child care, free preschool and paid family leave. What a country If we dont reach our goals, everything will be OK because Social Security and Medicare will be there to finance our retirement, and if that isnt enough, the government will put us in a retirement center where we live out the remainder of our years playing checkers or watching television. What about the fact that Social Security and Medicare are going broke How long can we keep printing money to keep us afloat before our economy collapses They never talk about that. As British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher once said, The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other peoples money. Dont be fooled This election is about a lot more than the two personalities at the top of the ticket. Its an important fork in the road One fork requires hard work and sacrifice but offers freedom. The other offers a free lunch. Media wishing to interview Jane Chastain, please contact .

"Print Before you applaud me for my integrity or condemn me for selling out, allow me to explain my decision to vote for Donald Trump on Nov. 8. First, Im writing this because I have been asked incessantly for months how I would be voting, not because I think Im someone special or that what I do should influence you. Second, Im not endorsing Donald Trump. In my mind, theres a world of difference between endorsing a candidate and voting for a candidate. Third, I respect those in the #NeverTrump camp and share many of their concerns, including the possibility of his further vulgarizing and degrading the nation, the possibility of him deepening our ethnic and racial divides, and the possibility of him alienating our allies and unnecessarily provoking our enemies, just to name a few. Among the #NeverTrump voices I respect are columnists like David French and Ben Shapiro, bloggers like Matt Walsh and evangelical leaders like Russell Moore and Beth Moore. Fourth, I take strong exception to evangelicals who have fawned over Trump as if he were some kind of savior figure, supporting him as if he were St. Donald. I also take issue with evangelical leaders who want us to minimize some of Trumps failings, constantly saying, Let him who is without sin cast the first one see John 87. This is not a question of condemning the man but rather a question of making a moral assessment as to his readiness to serve our nation. Fifth, my decision to vote for Trump, barring something earthshattering between now and Nov. 8, is consistent with my position, which has been 1 During the GOP primaries, I issued strong warnings against voting for Trump while we had other excellent choices. I did this in writing , on video and on the radio, but always stating that if Trump won the nomination, I would reevaluate my position. 2 Once Trump became the Republican candidate, I wrote that I was rooting for him to take steps in the right direction and thereby win my vote. 3 I have stated repeatedly that under no circumstances would I vote for Hillary. For two strong warnings about Hillary, see here and here . So, what has convinced me that I should now vote for Donald Trump The culture war is not over Gain hope, courage and practical advice in Michael Browns latest book, Outlasting the Gay Revolution Where Homosexual Activism Is Really Going and How to Turn the Tide First, I believe that he actually is serious about appointing prolife, proConstitution Supreme Court justices. When he said during the last debate that if youre prolife, you want to see Roe v. Wade overturned, and when he reiterated at his Gettysburg speech that he will be drawing from his list of 20 potential appointees, he helped me feel more confident that he would not suddenly flipflop if elected. Second, one reason I endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz was because he took on the political establishment, both Democratic and Republican, to the point of calling it the Washington cartel. Trump is an absolute wrecking ball to the negative parts of the political system although, unfortunately, hes been a wrecking ball to some of the good parts of the system, so my vote for him is also a protest vote. Third, I am voting for the Republican platform, not the Republican Party, which means Im in agreement with the platform while at the same time having very little confidence in the party as a whole. Fourth, while I have always felt that the line, Were electing a president, not a pastor, was overstated and superficial, if we rephrased it to say, Were electing a general to train handtohand combat warriors, not a pastor, it might have more relevance. In other words, we are not looking for Trump to be a moral reformer even if hedoes appoint righteous judges, and, at this point, he certainly is anything but a moral example although we pray he will be truly converted and become one. Rather, out of our choices for president, which are stark, we are voting for the one most likely to defeat Hillary and make some good decisions for the nation, not be the savior. And with things so messed up in America, the handtohand combat analogy is closer to home. Fifth, within the first few minutes of the last debate, the massive differences between Hillary and Trump were there for the world to see, she a proabortion radical and an extreme supporter of the LGBT agenda and he unashamedly speaking out against lateterm abortions and wanting to appoint justices who would defend our essential liberties. Since I have the opportunity to vote, I feel that I should vote for Trump. Sixth, Trump continues to be drawn to conservative Christians, and not just ones who tickle his ears. One of my dear friends has spent hours with Trump and members of his family, and he has told me that in 55 years of ministry, no one has received him as openly and graciously as has Trump. Yet my friend continues to speak the truth to him in the clearest possible terms. While I am not one of those claiming that Trump is a bornagain Christian I see absolutely no evidence of this, the fact that he continues to listen to godly men and open the door to their counsel indicates that something positive could possibly be going on. It also indicates that these godly leaders might be a positive influence on him if he were elected president. Seventh, although Im quite aware that a president could do great harm or good to the nation, Im far more concerned with what we as Gods people do with our own lives and witnesses, and for me, the state of the church of America is much more important than the state of the White House. In that context, I echo the words and warning of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The church must be reminded that it is not the master or the servant of the state, but rather the conscience of the state. It must be the guide and the critic of the state, and never its tool. If the church does not recapture its prophetic zeal, it will become an irrelevant social club without moral or spiritual authority. So, in sum 1 My hope is in God, not Donald Trump, and I do recognize that either Hillary or Trump has the potential to do great harm to America 2 My urgent call is for us as followers of Jesus to get our own act together so we can be the salt and light of the nation 3 I will continue to urge all believers not to vote for Hillary Clinton, whose policies will certainly do us great harm and 4 Ultimately, the most effective way to defeat Hillary is to vote for Trump, while also praying that God will use him for good , not for evil. In the end, if Trump gets elected and fails miserably, I will be grieved but not devastated. If he does well, I will rejoice. Either way, though, my vote is just that a vote. My greater role is to live a life pleasing to God with the hope of advancing a gospelbased moral and cultural revolution.

"Our new country Women and minorities hit hardest Ann Coulter Dems import cultures where rape, incest and spousal murder are acceptable Published 51 mins ago  Receive Ann Coulters alerts in your email BONUS By signing up for Ann Coulters alerts, you will also be signed up for news and special offers from WND via email. error Print Every ethnic group except whites blocvotes for the Democrats. Coincidentally, the Democrats have brought in another 30 to 40 million nonwhite immigrants in the last few decades. It doesnt help that white voters cant agree on what constitutes an acceptable candidate. In 2012, workingclass whites sat out the election, rather than vote for the outoftouch rich guy they saw in Mitt Romney. This year, the outoftouch rich guys say theyll vote for Hillary because Trump is tacky and gross. The sad irony is that the only people who will be better off in our new country are mostly white plutocrats  the top .01 percent. The rest of us will be their servants. The people who will be worse off are everybody else  the working class, the middle class who will soon be working class and, most of all, women, minorities, children, the elderly, the weakest and most vulnerable members of society. Look to Mexico for your future  or any Third World country. Or to Univisions Jorge Ramos. The ruling class in Mexico is composed of Europeanlooking, white descendants of Spanish conquistadors who raped the native population, giving them only their Spanish names in return. British settlers in America brought women with them. Explaining Latino cultures acceptance of incest and child rape, criminal justice researcher Shana Maier writes in a book about rape that the male is the head of the household, and women are subordinate to men.  Hispanics and Latinos are more likely than other racial/ethnic groups to blame the victim. The victim, not the perpetrator, is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family. One American detective said that, today, police are being taught to keep an open mind about child rape because its a cultural thing. When it comes to multiculturalism, you cant say, We love the empanadas  but we dont want 40yearold men raping their nieces . This isnt an a la carte menu. We get ALL the attributes of the cultures were importing. As described in excruciating detail in Adios, America The Lefts Plan to Turn Our Country into a Third World Hellhole, our media already have a totally open mind about incest and child rape  and murder  when its committed by immigrants. Thus, for example, where I would have chosen the headline Illegal Alien Convicted of Incest, Child Rape, the Chattanooga Tenn. Times Free Press went with the less catchy Man guilty in case of human smuggling. And where I would have used the headline, Illegal Alien Repeatedly Raped 14yearold Girl at Job Site, the Commercial Dispatch in Columbus, Mississippi, went with the more subtle, Columbus resident charged with molestation. Immigrant women arrive in America, thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape, incest and spousal murder are acceptable, only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country, too  provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled. In 1989, Brooklyn Judge Edward Pincus sentenced a Chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife, on the grounds that the murder flowed from traditional Chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood. The female head of the AsianAmerican Legal Defense and Education Fund, Margaret Fung, applauded the ruling. Somewhat amazingly, newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime. Anything to keep the Third World immigration flowing In 2013, a 13yearold girl was gangraped by about a dozen illegal aliens, who cheered and videoed the attack. When the news first broke, Shaneequa Jupiter, who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred, complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger. That could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants Even if Shaneequa had scoured the headlines, she would have been on the lookout for Austin men. Or Two. Compare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack  Two held in attack on child  Austin AmericanStatesman Texas, July 19, 2013  Two Mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over fiveday gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack  Daily Mail Online, July 24, 2013 Needless to say, the New York Times did not cover the Mexican illegalalien gang rape at all. The ultimate primer on the bluecollar billionaire order Ann Coulters book In Trump We Trust E Pluribus Awesome By contrast, the Times, and every major American news outlet, extensively covered another gang rape  of a girl about the same age, at about the same time, in about the same place. The second case only was rape because of the girls young age  she was 11. But she was an enthusiastic participant, sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex. Those rapes, just a few years earlier, got a fullcourt press. The defendants were AfricanAmerican. The victim was Mexican. That time, there were articles in the Huffington Post, GQ, Slate, Salon and Mother Jones. It even made the New York Times, despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team. Similarly, within a few months of one another in 2013, two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in Decatur, Alabama, for assaults on 9yearold girls. One suspect was AfricanAmerican, the other was a Hispanic immigrant. Only one made the newspaper. Guess which one When excitable Muslims raped American reporter Lara Logan in Tahrir Square another one of Hillarys foreign policy successes, journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the Muslim rapists to white American men. Conclusion The real problem was the female reporters American bosses and colleagues. Definitely not Islam Sampling of New York Times commentary on Logans rape  Why We Need Women in War Zones I would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened.  This attack also had nothing to do with Islam.  Reporting While Female Women reporters face another set of challenges. We are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not.  In my experience, Muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment. Perhaps American men could do better, but, as American women may soon discover They never had it so good. Manifestly, the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help Americans  or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like America. They are designed to funnel welfaredependent voters to the Democrats and cheap labor to the rich. The Chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife, for example, came to America based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher. Our country will be Zimbabwe, but  if all goes according to the Democrats plan  theyll get to be Mugabe Thats Hillarys dream. If she wins, Joe Sobrans parody of the typical New York Times headline about anything will come true Women and Minorities Hit Hardest.

The game gets increasingly old and tiring to watch, and playing it can inflict permanent brain damage. Democrats can be counted upon to call the Republican opponent racist, whether the opponent is the priestly Mitt Romney or the Supreme Court justice who wrote the Dred Scott decision. Donald Trump, you see, is racist because, among other reasons, at a campaign stop he pointed to a black man and called him my AfricanAmerican. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, is not antiSemitic, even though three witnesses, one of whom took and passed a polygraph, claim that she referred to her husbands former congressional campaign manager as a fing Jew bastard. With a Republican candidate, the media can be counted upon to seize upon any deficiencies  big or small, real or imagined  while giving the Democrat a pass. So Trumps failure to ever apologize outweighs an examination of Clintons flatout lie during the third debate when she insisted that the Supreme Court Heller case was about toddlers, as opposed to the fundamental issue of whether the Second Amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear arms. In Heller, nowhere in the majority decision or in any of the dissenting decisions does the word toddler appear. Clinton, a year ago, flatout said, The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment. To normal people, this meant she opposed what the decision ruled on, which, again, was whether we, as individuals, have a right to keep and bear arms. Meanwhile, we learn more and more about what the media labels an email scandal, when the accurate description is national security scandal. The Espionage Act criminalizes gross negligence in the handling of important national security matters. The law does not require, as FBI Director James Comey falsely stated, an intent. Nor is it relevant, as Clinton insists, whether or not her private server, the one she maintained in her basement, was hacked. Five people who worked with or for Clinton, including her chief of staff, all received immunity deals, something normally given to get someone to flip on a target. Some of the five were involved in deleting emails after the emails were subpoenaed. But the target, that is to say Hillary Clinton, was deemed by Comey to have lacked sufficient criminal intent to be prosecuted. So why the immunity deals Who knows  and as far as most of the media are concerned, who cares Clinton insists that President Obama doesnt get enough credit for the swell job he did with the economy. This would be the economy in which, for the first time in history, a president has presided over a recovery without a single year of at least 3 percent growth in gross domestic product. This would be the same economy with an alleged low unemployment number that Gallup CEO Jim Clifton calls the big lie, given the large number of people who simply abandoned the job hunt or are underemployed. Meanwhile, its yet another day in which another woman who alleges she was kissed, groped, touched, or made fun of by Trump has appeared with her attorney, feminist Gloria Allred. Allred, a Clinton supporter, sees no contradiction between representing alleged victims of Trumps sexual misconduct and her support for Clinton, who is alleged to have hired private detectives and lawyers to dig up dirt on her husbands accusers. One such accuser, Juanita Broaddrick, claims not only that she was raped by Bill Clinton but also that two weeks after the alleged rape, Hillary Clinton verbally threatened her. Hillary Clinton, mind you, has never been asked by anyone in the media about Broaddricks allegation. Never. And only one national reporter, Sam Donaldson, has ever asked Bill Clinton about Juanita Broaddricks allegation. Ever. Clintons answer He referred Donaldson to his lawyer, David Kendall. Donaldson quickly tried again, asking the thenpresident to simply deny it. Same answer My attorney  speaks for me. And that was that. So Hillary Clinton is a candidate who wants to continue the same policy thats given us the worst recovery since 1949 who has clearly violated the Espionage Act and placed the nations security at risk who told the Benghazi victims families that the death of four Americans was inspired by a video, while telling her daughter and foreign officials something entirely different whose charitable foundation engaged in paytoplay in Haiti, so that donors got contracts for disaster relief and nondonors went to the back of the line who wants to gut the Second Amendment who wants to continue the same foreign policies that that have encouraged aggressiveness on the part of ISIS, Russia and the Chinese and whose media compadres, including scribes with the New York Times, Washington Post and CNBC, have been outed by WikiLeaks as colluding with her campaign. And she is now oddson favorite to become the next president of the United States.

During a Tuesday discussion of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps sinking poll numbers, Gingrich accused Fox News Channel host Megyn Kelly of being fascinated with sex when she dared to mention that Trumps fortunes began falling after the now infamous Access Hollywood video, featuring Trump boasting about his selfproclaimed prerogative to sexually assault women, became public on October 7, and nearly a dozen women came forward to allege that Trump had either assaulted them or otherwise taken liberties with their bodies.",bias
"Print Sidebyside of Bill Clinton and Danney Williams NEW YORK YouTube on Wednesday suspended the account of Danney Williams, the 30yearold who has claimed since the 1990s to be the black son of former President Bill Clinton. YouTube, citing repeated or severe violations of our Terms of Use and/or Community Guidelines, declared the account cannot be restored. The YouTube decision blocked the nineminute feature BANISHED  The Untold Story of Danney Williams, which had received 1.2 million views since Williams posted it last week. Produced by filmmaker Joel Gilbert, it drew nearly 100,000 views per day and more than 1,000 viewer comments, with the overwhelming majority expressing support for Williams and outrage at the Clintons for not being willing to allow a DNA test to determine paternity. Like the reporting you see here Sign up for free news alerts from WND.com, Americas independent news network. My YouTube account has been deleted, but the same video appears in 50 other places on YouTube alone, Williams said on his Facebook page after being notified of YouTubes decision. YouTube cant handle the truth Please share #BillClintonSon. Twitter also continues to allow Williams to post the Banished video on Danney Williams page , but the Twitter link to YouTube displays the message  This video is no longer available because the YouTube account associated with this video has been terminated. Sorry about that. The video is still running on Danney WilliamsClintons Facebook page , as well as on the YouTube channel operated by Gilbert. Attempt to silence Danney Williams Gilbert told WND he helped Williams file an online appeal form on YouTube asking why the account was suspended and demanding it be immediately reinstated. The behavior of YouTube/Google in suspending Danneys account is outrageous There have been absolutely zero violations of any kind let alone a severe one of any YouTube terms or guidelines, Gilbert said. Gilbert was outspoken in charging YouTube with partisan political motives for the suspension. The only possible explanation is that the Clinton campaign requested YouTube/Google to silence Danney, to run him off the plantation as Danney said Hillary Clinton did to him and his aunt when he was a small child and they were chased off the grounds of the Arkansas governors mansion in 1990, Gilbert said. Danney cannot be silenced any longer, he continued. Hillary may try to sweep Danney Williams under the rug, but its not going to work this time. His story is out there, and every day more and more people understand Bill and Hillary Clinton banished this young man from their family because of the color of his skin. See the Danney Williams video feature WND reported Oct. 19 that in the hours before the third and final presidential debate, attorneys for Williams were in Las Vegas to announce their intention to file a paternity suit demanding DNA evidence from the former president. Accompanying the dramatic announcement was a rap music video celebrating Williams that went viral on the Internet. No definitive DNA test WND reported that no DNA test was conducted in 1999, despite media reports to the contrary when Williams claim first surfaced. Clinton defenders since 1999 have contended the tabloid Star Magazine conducted a DNA showdown proving Bill Clinton was not Williams father, citing Star Magazine editor Phil Bunton saying at the time, There was no match, nothing even close. But in an interview, Bunton told WND that no blood sample was obtained from Clinton and Star Magazine never published a story documenting a laboratory test. I dont remember ever seeing any laboratory test that was done on Clintons DNA, Bunton told WND. Bunton is now the owner of the Rivertown Magazine in Haverstraw, New York. He affirmed to WND that the tabloid relied on the DNA evidence for Clinton published by independent counsel Kenneth Starr, extracted from the infamous Monica Lewinsky blue dress. We got a lot of phone calls from several people in the media, including the New York Times, wanting to know when we were going to get the DNA back, Bunton recalled to WND. We thought it was going to turn out to be his son, but when the DNA came back there was no story there even to write. The DNA test released by Kenneth Starr was the second of two DNA laboratory tests the FBI had run on Clinton, but the public record leaves no doubt that Starr withheld the more robust test conducted by the FBI. Twitter rules Many other figures who have challenged the Democratic Party or the leftleaning media narrative also have run into trouble with social media outlets, including James OKeefe and his Project Veritas, which has exposed Clinton campaign voter fraud and agitation in a series of hiddencamera videos. Just as OKeefe was preparing to release new revelations of voter fraud Oct. 13, Twitter shut down his account , claiming violations of Twitter Rules. The notice said he must delete the tweets that are in violation of our rules, which prohibit harassing other users, threatening other users, disclosing other users private information or violating other rules. In a statement, OKeefe said he relies on social media to bypass the media and directly reach the public. On Monday, OKeefe wrote in a tweet Project Veritas was unable to upload its third video in the series to YouTube, calling the apparent block bizarre. Earlier this month, OKeefe was forced to delete a tweet critical of a Hillary Clinton staffer to regain use of his account after it was suspended for a day. His account was suspended in the hours before a release of a new hiddencamera video that exposed a Clinton ally saying she could use executive action on guns, the Daily Caller reported . Project Veritas posted an undercover video Oct. 17 proving Hillary Clinton supporters were inciting violence at Donald Trump rallies to gain negative media coverage. Millions of viewers watched the video in just a few hours, but it didnt show up on Googles trending list on YouTube, which Google owns, noted SilenceisConsent.net . It did, however, trend on Twitter, which Google does not own. Breitbart blogger Milo Yiannopoulos was suspended permanently by Twitter minutes before his Gays for Trump party at the Republican National Convention. For some 11 months, the makers of the new movie Im Not Ashamed, about the first victim of the Columbine killers in Colorado in 1999, were unable to promote their movie through YouTube. The trailer was taken down late in 2015, and the movies entire channel was suspended . Among the conservatives censored by Facebook  Conservative activist and Trump supporter Lauren Southern received a 30day ban from Facebook because she complained about a friends account being censored. Facebook locked a 12yearold black middle schoolers account for posting a video supporting Rudy Giulianis comment that Obama doesnt love America.

"26 WikiLeaks bombshells on Hillary you need to know Most explosive revelations that could keep Clinton out of White House Published 5 mins ago Leo Hohmann About   Archive Leo Hohmann is a news editor for WND. He has been a reporter and editor at several suburban newspapers in the Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, areas and also served as managing editor of Triangle Business Journal in Raleigh, North Carolina. Print Hillary Clinton with top aide Huma Abedin. WikiLeaks has provided a treasure trove of inside information on what Hillary Clinton really thinks about important issues such as trade and immigration, but Clinton herself has chosen not to answer questions about the revelations. She has focused instead on criticizing the Russians as the source of the hacks, despite the fact there is no proof of Russian involvement. The emails also shed light on how the Clinton campaign interacts with Wall Street banks, with friendly media, and how it worked to undermine the candidacy of Democratic rival Bernie Sanders with the help of the DNC. WikiLeaks says it has about 50,000 emails from the private Gmail account of John Podesta, a senior Democratic Party official who has served as White House chief of staff under President Bill Clinton and a senior adviser to President Obama. He was the author of Obamas climate change policy. John Podesta In February Podesta moved seamlessly from the White House to become chairman of Hillary Clintons 2016 presidential campaign. Here are some of the most explosive revelations from the WikiLeaks email dumps featuring Podestas account and others. Preference for Muslim Americans In 2008, when Podesta served as cochair of Presidentelect Barack Obamas transition team, Michael Froman, a former Citibank executive, sent Podesta a list of African American, Latino and Asian American candidates, broken down by Cabinet/Deputy and Under/Assistant/Deputy Assistant level, plus a list of Native American, Arab/Muslim American and Disabled American candidates. The Arab American list came with a special note to exclude Arab Christians  they had to be both Arab and Muslim.As New Republic reports, Obamas eventual cabinet appointments ended up almost entirely as Froman recommended.Froman ultimately became the recipient of the largest bailout from the federal government during the financial crisis. Shielding Obama In a March 4, 2015, email to Hillary Clintons lawyer Cheryl Mills, Clintons eventual campaign chairman Podesta asks if they should withhold email exchanges between Clinton and President Obama that were sent over Clintons private server.The day before Podesta sent his email to Mills, the House Benghazi Committee privately told Clinton to preserve and hand over all her emails.The email from Podesta to Mills says Think we should hold emails to and from potus Thats the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but It seems like they will. An email exchange between Podesta, Paul Begala, and Clinton pollster GQRR shows the Clinton campaign was pushing the Muslim Obama narrative back in January 2008. Included was a survey of Obama negative facts such as this one Obama oweBAHMuhs father was a Muslim and Obama grew up among Muslims in the worlds most populous Islamic country. The pollster writes we have reworked the Obama message into the survey, as requested. Secret speeches to Wall Street Hillary Clinton was so enraged that Bill Clinton was forced to cancel a paid speech at Wall Street bank Morgan Stanley in 2015 that she needed a cool down period. The email chain, on March 11, 2015, before she formally launched her campaign, includes top aides to both Hillary Clinton and former President Clinton, and reveals that Hillarys future campaign aides were concerned about the political impact of Bill giving a speech to a Wall Street bank. Morgan Stanley is coming down, wrote Robby Mook in an email to top Clinton aides.Top aide Huma Abedin explained that Hillary would not be happy about it, writing HRC very strongly did not want him to cancel that particular speech. I will have to tell her that Bill chose to cancel it, not that we asked. Hillary Clintons paid speeches to Goldman Sachs and other financial firms, a point of contention during this years primary, were the subject of an email to Podesta. Excerpts from some of the speeches had been flagged by Clintons research team, including the necessity of having both a public and a private position on issues. It was just part of making sausage in the political arena, she said, that certain positions on issues needed to be kept hidden from the public. Some flags in Hillary Clintons paid speeches were noted in a Jan. 25 email from campaign research director Tony Carrk to top Clinton advisers, including Clintons declaration that My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere. Countless establishment media outlets parlaying themselves as fact checkers tried to downplay this email by saying it was mostly about trade, not immigration, as if the words open borders were never mentioned. But the email exchange also shows how Hillarys aboutface on the TPP trade deal was mere pandering to Bernie Sanders voters and had no basis in reality in terms of how she really feels about trade deals. In a speech at GoldmanBlack Rock on Feb. 4, 2014, Carrk pointed out, Clinton admitted shes Kind Of Far Removed from middleclass struggles due to The Economic, You Know, Fortunes That My Husband And I Now Enjoy. Clinton, in other speeches, boasted of her ties to Wall Street, an issue primary opponent Bernie Sanders continually raised. Clinton still has refused to release transcripts of her paid speeches while blasting Donald Trump for not releasing his tax returns. Working in tandem with friendly media WND reported Tuesday emails showing reporters, editors and contributors not just advocating for Hillary Clinton but apparently colluding with the campaign. Univision Chairman Haim Saban urged the Clinton campaign to hit Donald Trump harder over immigration. The Boston Globe tried to time a Clinton opinion piece to do the most good in New Hampshire. CNBCs John Harwood urged Clinton campaign chairman Podesta to watch out for thenGOP candidate Dr. Ben Carson. Democratic National Committee official and CNN contributor Donna Brazile apparently tipped off the Clinton campaign to a potentially difficult CNN townhall question on capital punishment during the Democratic Party primary season. Brazile adamantly denies it . In a July 2015 email, New York Times reporter Mark Leibovich appeared to ask permission from Hillary Clintons communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, to use certain quotes of the presidential candidate in an article. Palmieri replied, suggesting he remove a reference Clinton made to Sarah Palin and delete Clintons statement, And gay rights has moved much faster than womens rights or civil rights, which is an interesting phenomenon. CNBC correspondent John Harwood, who was widely criticized for posing biased questions to Donald Trump as a primary debate moderator, effectively served as an adviser to the Clinton campaign, emailing Podesta with the subject line Watch out. The warning was regarding GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson, who could give you real trouble in a general election. Maggie Haberman, a former Politico reporter who now works for the New York Times, was described in a January 2015 memo as having a very good relationship with the Clinton campaign. We have had her tee up stories for us before and have never been disappointed, the memo said. Demeaning Catholics Podesta discussed fomenting revolution in the Catholic Church with a progressive activist while Hillarys nowcommunications director Jennifer Palmieri mocked Catholics who speak out against the liberal social causes of the Democratic Party. There needs to be a Catholic Spring, in which Catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the Catholic Church, Sandy Newman, president and founder of the nonprofit Voices for Progress, wrote Podesta in February 2012 . The email, among the third batch released by WikiLeaks, was titled opening for a Catholic Spring just musing. Podesta tells Newman of progressive organizations he and his colleagues created to recruit members of the church who can lead a revolution when the time is right.We created Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good to organize for a moment like this, the Clinton campaign chairman writes. But I think it lacks the leadership to do so now. Likewise Catholics United. Like most Spring movements, I think this one will have to be bottom up. Clinton, who has accused Trump of praising Putin, called the Russian leader in a 2014 speech engaging and a very interesting conversationalist. Excerpts from Clintons speeches were contained in a document emailed to Podesta to point out quotes that could harm the campaign. Collusion with DOJ Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon alerted staffers that the Justice Department was proposing to publish Clintons workrelated emails, contending it showed collusion between the Obama administration and Clintons campaign. Fallon wrote that DOJ folks told him a court hearing in the case had been planned. The day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, Podesta met for dinner with a small group of wellconnected friends, including Peter Kadzik, a top official at the Justice Department. Lawyers also told the Clinton campaign in emails that Hillarys private email scandal  smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing Ive either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc . Entanglements with foreign governments King Muhammad IV of Morocco made a 12 million pledge to fund the Clinton Global Initiative conference, but only if the likely presidential candidate attended the event as a speaker. Hillarys top aide, Huma Abedin, wrote in a January 2015 email that if HRC was not part of it, meeting was a nonstarter. Then she warned She created this mess and she knows it. Hillary ended up not attending but her husband Bill did. An email from Hillary Clintons account to Podesta on Aug. 17, 2014, said Saudi Arabia and Qatar were providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIS and other radical Sunni groups in the region. Critics have pointed out that the Clinton Foundation has received considerable funding from the two Middle East nations. In a leaked 2013 paid speech to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago, Hillary said Jordan and Turkey cant possibly vet all those refugees so they dont know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees. Two years later she called for a 550 percent increase in the number of Syrian refugees coming to the U.S. largely from United Nations refugee camps in Jordan. Insiders insider had sway over DNC A WikiLeaks email dump on July 22 revealed that Debbie Wasserman Schultz used her position as head of the DNC to work in concert with the Clinton campaign to undermine the candidacy of Sen. Bernie Sanders, DVt. Schultz was forced to resign over the emails. Issues used to undermine Sanders campaign included his faith, or lack thereof. The Clinton campaign tried to reschedule the Illinois presidential primary to lower the chances a moderate Republican would get a boost following the Super Tuesday primaries. The Clintons wont forget what their friends have done for them, wrote Robby Mook, who later became Clintons campaign manager, in the November 2014 email to Podesta.",bias

He has been a reporter and editor at several suburban newspapers in the Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, areas and also served as managing editor of Triangle Business Journal in Raleigh, North Carolina. Print Hillary Clinton with top aide Huma Abedin. WikiLeaks has provided a treasure trove of inside information on what Hillary Clinton really thinks about important issues such as trade and immigration, but Clinton herself has chosen not to answer questions about the revelations. She has focused instead on criticizing the Russians as the source of the hacks, despite the fact there is no proof of Russian involvement. The emails also shed light on how the Clinton campaign interacts with Wall Street banks, with friendly media, and how it worked to undermine the candidacy of Democratic rival Bernie Sanders with the help of the DNC. WikiLeaks says it has about 50,000 emails from the private Gmail account of John Podesta, a senior Democratic Party official who has served as White House chief of staff under President Bill Clinton and a senior adviser to President Obama. He was the author of Obamas climate change policy. John Podesta In February Podesta moved seamlessly from the White House to become chairman of Hillary Clintons 2016 presidential campaign. Here are some of the most explosive revelations from the WikiLeaks email dumps featuring Podestas account and others. Preference for Muslim Americans In 2008, when Podesta served as cochair of Presidentelect Barack Obamas transition team, Michael Froman, a former Citibank executive, sent Podesta a list of African American, Latino and Asian American candidates, broken down by Cabinet/Deputy and Under/Assistant/Deputy Assistant level, plus a list of Native American, Arab/Muslim American and Disabled American candidates. The Arab American list came with a special note to exclude Arab Christians  they had to be both Arab and Muslim.As New Republic reports, Obamas eventual cabinet appointments ended up almost entirely as Froman recommended.Froman ultimately became the recipient of the largest bailout from the federal government during the financial crisis. Shielding Obama In a March 4, 2015, email to Hillary Clintons lawyer Cheryl Mills, Clintons eventual campaign chairman Podesta asks if they should withhold email exchanges between Clinton and President Obama that were sent over Clintons private server.The day before Podesta sent his email to Mills, the House Benghazi Committee privately told Clinton to preserve and hand over all her emails.The email from Podesta to Mills says Think we should hold emails to and from potus Thats the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but It seems like they will. An email exchange between Podesta, Paul Begala, and Clinton pollster GQRR shows the Clinton campaign was pushing the Muslim Obama narrative back in January 2008. Included was a survey of Obama negative facts such as this one Obama oweBAHMuhs father was a Muslim and Obama grew up among Muslims in the worlds most populous Islamic country. The pollster writes we have reworked the Obama message into the survey, as requested. Secret speeches to Wall Street Hillary Clinton was so enraged that Bill Clinton was forced to cancel a paid speech at Wall Street bank Morgan Stanley in 2015 that she needed a cool down period. The email chain, on March 11, 2015, before she formally launched her campaign, includes top aides to both Hillary Clinton and former President Clinton, and reveals that Hillarys future campaign aides were concerned about the political impact of Bill giving a speech to a Wall Street bank. Morgan Stanley is coming down, wrote Robby Mook in an email to top Clinton aides.Top aide Huma Abedin explained that Hillary would not be happy about it, writing HRC very strongly did not want him to cancel that particular speech. I will have to tell her that Bill chose to cancel it, not that we asked. Hillary Clintons paid speeches to Goldman Sachs and other financial firms, a point of contention during this years primary, were the subject of an email to Podesta. Excerpts from some of the speeches had been flagged by Clintons research team, including the necessity of having both a public and a private position on issues. It was just part of making sausage in the political arena, she said, that certain positions on issues needed to be kept hidden from the public. Some flags in Hillary Clintons paid speeches were noted in a Jan. 25 email from campaign research director Tony Carrk to top Clinton advisers, including Clintons declaration that My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere. Countless establishment media outlets parlaying themselves as fact checkers tried to downplay this email by saying it was mostly about trade, not immigration, as if the words open borders were never mentioned. But the email exchange also shows how Hillarys aboutface on the TPP trade deal was mere pandering to Bernie Sanders voters and had no basis in reality in terms of how she really feels about trade deals. In a speech at GoldmanBlack Rock on Feb. 4, 2014, Carrk pointed out, Clinton admitted shes Kind Of Far Removed from middleclass struggles due to The Economic, You Know, Fortunes That My Husband And I Now Enjoy. Clinton, in other speeches, boasted of her ties to Wall Street, an issue primary opponent Bernie Sanders continually raised. Clinton still has refused to release transcripts of her paid speeches while blasting Donald Trump for not releasing his tax returns. Working in tandem with friendly media WND reported Tuesday emails showing reporters, editors and contributors not just advocating for Hillary Clinton but apparently colluding with the campaign. Univision Chairman Haim Saban urged the Clinton campaign to hit Donald Trump harder over immigration. The Boston Globe tried to time a Clinton opinion piece to do the most good in New Hampshire. CNBCs John Harwood urged Clinton campaign chairman Podesta to watch out for thenGOP candidate Dr. Ben Carson. Democratic National Committee official and CNN contributor Donna Brazile apparently tipped off the Clinton campaign to a potentially difficult CNN townhall question on capital punishment during the Democratic Party primary season. Brazile adamantly denies it . In a July 2015 email, New York Times reporter Mark Leibovich appeared to ask permission from Hillary Clintons communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, to use certain quotes of the presidential candidate in an article. Palmieri replied, suggesting he remove a reference Clinton made to Sarah Palin and delete Clintons statement, And gay rights has moved much faster than womens rights or civil rights, which is an interesting phenomenon. CNBC correspondent John Harwood, who was widely criticized for posing biased questions to Donald Trump as a primary debate moderator, effectively served as an adviser to the Clinton campaign, emailing Podesta with the subject line Watch out. The warning was regarding GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson, who could give you real trouble in a general election. Maggie Haberman, a former Politico reporter who now works for the New York Times, was described in a January 2015 memo as having a very good relationship with the Clinton campaign. We have had her tee up stories for us before and have never been disappointed, the memo said. Demeaning Catholics Podesta discussed fomenting revolution in the Catholic Church with a progressive activist while Hillarys nowcommunications director Jennifer Palmieri mocked Catholics who speak out against the liberal social causes of the Democratic Party. There needs to be a Catholic Spring, in which Catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the Catholic Church, Sandy Newman, president and founder of the nonprofit Voices for Progress, wrote Podesta in February 2012 . The email, among the third batch released by WikiLeaks, was titled opening for a Catholic Spring just musing. Podesta tells Newman of progressive organizations he and his colleagues created to recruit members of the church who can lead a revolution when the time is right.We created Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good to organize for a moment like this, the Clinton campaign chairman writes. But I think it lacks the leadership to do so now. Likewise Catholics United. Like most Spring movements, I think this one will have to be bottom up. Clinton, who has accused Trump of praising Putin, called the Russian leader in a 2014 speech engaging and a very interesting conversationalist. Excerpts from Clintons speeches were contained in a document emailed to Podesta to point out quotes that could harm the campaign. Collusion with DOJ Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon alerted staffers that the Justice Department was proposing to publish Clintons workrelated emails, contending it showed collusion between the Obama administration and Clintons campaign. Fallon wrote that DOJ folks told him a court hearing in the case had been planned. The day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, Podesta met for dinner with a small group of wellconnected friends, including Peter Kadzik, a top official at the Justice Department. Lawyers also told the Clinton campaign in emails that Hillarys private email scandal  smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing Ive either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc . Entanglements with foreign governments King Muhammad IV of Morocco made a 12 million pledge to fund the Clinton Global Initiative conference, but only if the likely presidential candidate attended the event as a speaker. Hillarys top aide, Huma Abedin, wrote in a January 2015 email that if HRC was not part of it, meeting was a nonstarter. Then she warned She created this mess and she knows it. Hillary ended up not attending but her husband Bill did. An email from Hillary Clintons account to Podesta on Aug. 17, 2014, said Saudi Arabia and Qatar were providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIS and other radical Sunni groups in the region. Critics have pointed out that the Clinton Foundation has received considerable funding from the two Middle East nations. In a leaked 2013 paid speech to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago, Hillary said Jordan and Turkey cant possibly vet all those refugees so they dont know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees. Two years later she called for a 550 percent increase in the number of Syrian refugees coming to the U.S. largely from United Nations refugee camps in Jordan. Insiders insider had sway over DNC A WikiLeaks email dump on July 22 revealed that Debbie Wasserman Schultz used her position as head of the DNC to work in concert with the Clinton campaign to undermine the candidacy of Sen. Bernie Sanders, DVt. Schultz was forced to resign over the emails. Issues used to undermine Sanders campaign included his faith, or lack thereof. The Clinton campaign tried to reschedule the Illinois presidential primary to lower the chances a moderate Republican would get a boost following the Super Tuesday primaries. The Clintons wont forget what their friends have done for them, wrote Robby Mook, who later became Clintons campaign manager, in the November 2014 email to Podesta.",bias

"Print Fairfax County, Virginia, voter Jena Jones told WND and Radio America she found this Democrat insert included with her absentee ballot, among others Democratic Party officials in Fairfax County, Virginia, are categorically denying that proDemocrat campaign materials were included in the same envelope as a voters absentee ballot, arguing that pamphlets were sent in a separate mailing to absentee voters from the Fairfax County Democratic Committee, or FCDC. Earlier this week, Jena and David Jones shared their story of finding more than they expected in the envelope that contained her ballot. See images of the materials Jena and David say they found at the end of this article. Also included are two images from Democrats showing what they say is confusion on the part of the voters. I found a letter from the governor of Virginia asking me to please vote Democrat and help keep Virginia blue this year, Jena explained. Then I got a letter from the Fairfax County Democratic Committee, giving me a stepbystep, yesandno what I should vote for as far as the meal tax and all those other things on the ballot. In recent days, at least two more people contend they received the same materials in the envelope with their absentee ballots. After the report was first published, and shared on Facebook by David Jones, Fairfax County Democratic Committee Executive Director Frank Anderson replied to Davids post to dispute their account of what the ballot envelope contained. These materials were NOT sent in the same envelope as the ballot. The ballot is mailed separately by the Office of Elections. Political parties are free to mail items to voters who request absentee ballots. The two envelopes arrived at the same time, commented Anderson. That triggered a quick backandforth between David Jones and Anderson. I hate to tell you but youre wrong. All items came in one envelope, Jones said. Like the reporting you see here Sign up for free news alerts from WND.com, Americas independent news network. Impossible. That letter came out of my office. We never have access to other peoples ballots, replied Anderson. Then it seems those that sent the ballots have access to YOUR letters, said Jones. Who should I believe You or my lying eyes Anderson then stated that political parties are informed when anyone requests an absentee ballot, and mailings are sent to those voters to promote Democratic Party candidates and positions on ballot initiatives. I am literally sitting down the hall from the place where those envelopes are stuffed. We are a political office and have no business handling anyones ballots. You can believe what you want to believe, concluded Anderson. The Virginia Department of Elections did not respond to repeated attempts for a response. But after seeing reports from WND and Radio America, Anderson protested the premise of the story. Please stop spreading these absurd allegations that are just hearsay from a misinformed voter who cannot verify his claim, stated Anderson in an email in which he also explained why he believed the Jones account could not be accurate. He shared a photo sent by State Sen. Scott Surovell, showing his absentee ballot envelope next to a separate envelope containing Democratic Party advocacy. In a formal interview, FCDC Communications Adviser Bruce Neilson told WND and Radio America the Jones version of what the ballot envelope contained cannot be true. Its not possible, said Neilson, who then explained how absentee voters are approached by the local Democrats. Voting is a sacred privilege and a right of every citizen, he said. The activity of voting is also a public record. The Fairfax County Democratic Committee receives a notice of everyone who has requested an absentee ballot. We get that information as public information on the day the ballot is mailed. The same day the ballot is mailed, our volunteers prepare materials to advise voters what the Fairfax County Democratic Committee knows to be Democratic positions on the ballot, said Neilson, noting the materials include fliers on candidates and ballot proposals like the meals tax. Listen to the WND/Radio America interview with Bruce Neilson However, he insists those materials are never sent with the ballot itself. That material is mailed in a separate envelope, labeled with our initials  FCDC  and our return address in Fairfax, Virginia, and would be received either the same day, perhaps the day before or the day after she received her official absentee ballot from the government, Neilson said. Its a separate mailing. Its a separate stamp. Its a separate envelope. Its very easy to confuse where they came from if you have all those materials on the table at the same time while youre filling in your votes, he said. Jones is standing by her story 100 percent, as is her husband. David says its a very clear memory. Jena opened the envelope that contained her ballot, the green sample ballot, the twosided letter from the governor and card with kids on it saying go vote or something of that nature. There was also the return envelope, which I signed, David said. The coverage of Jenas story has also elicited similar stories from two other Fairfax County voters. Both of them commented on Reddit. I can confirm this. I live in Herndon, VA Fairfax County and also received these materials in my absentee ballot.

Our materials are printed for us, by our printer, and we have complete control over our materials in our office, and they come from our office in our mailing. They dont go anywhere else. Its not possible that the county government is distributing partisan Democratic materials. Its never happened before. Im not aware of it happening now. And I dont think that it would happen anywhere in the future, Neilson said. There are only a few known complaints of stuffed ballot envelopes in Fairfax County, leading David Jones to believe an individual in the government is responsible. He accepts the explanation that the Fairfax County Democratic Committee is not responsible for what he and Jena discovered with her ballot. I understand Franks comments about his office has nothing to do with the ballots. I believe that, Jones said. I think what we are seeing here is a person that actually stuffs and mails the ballots is taking it upon themselves to add in extra material. I dont see how Franks office could be held accountable for whats in the ballot envelope. But it does seem odd that others are now reporting similar issues. Neilson said there is zero chance of that scenario being true. I just cant imagine that happening because of the internal controls that we have on the literature that we mail, Neilson said. He also said the internal controls at the county government are air tight. I am an election official. On Election Day, I serve in a nonpartisan capacity for our county election office, Nielson said. I can assure you, you have Democrats and Republicans working in the office. You have plenty of oversight of the voting process, and theres no way that a partisan political piece was mailed with her ballot. There is no way that happened.

"Print Saeed Toosi, right, and Ayatollah Khamenei After failed attempts by top Iran officials to cover up the scandal, the nations leading reciter of the Quran and close friend of Ayatollah Khamenei has been accused of raping 19 of his students and charged with advocating corruption. Saeed Toosi, 46, winner of the first prize for reading the Quran, both internationally and locally, fell under suspicion after a broadcast by Persian Voice of America  banned for viewing by Tehran  in which three alleged rape victims came forward with written and audio evidence and described sexual assaults by Toosi, reported Al Arabiya. In an audio recording, Toosi said that Khamenei knew of the sexual assaults and, together with the head of Irans judicial authority, had agreed to a coverup to protect the reputation of the nations quranic institution and the regime. Its time to stop tiptoeing around the facts. The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam and the Crusades is a muchneeded dose of truth about the religion of peace. One document has Toosi admitting that his actions with his students had been a mistake. One of the victims  a recent firstplace winner in a quranic competition  claimed he was raped when he was 12 while traveling abroad with Toosi to attend a competition. The mentor, according to the charge, booked the pair in a single hotel room where the attack took place. All victims who have filed statements were between 12 and 14 at the time of the alleged attacks. The incidents took place over the past seven years during quranic trips to more than 20 countries in the world aimed at spreading the quranic culture and to participate in quranic competitions. Toosi is highly respected as Irans most celebrated reader of the Quran and was previously called an exemplary model to be followed by Khamenei, current supreme leader of Iran. He is a permanent guest of Khamenei in the annual quranic councils celebrated during Ramadan. Last May, Toosi was asked to recite verses from the Quran at the opening session of the Shura council, with many of Irans top officials in attendance. The students told Persian VOA they had filed charges with the House of Leadership, but officials dismissed their claims, citing a repentance letter from Toosi admitting his actions and claiming to be a changed man. While Iran officially imposes the death penalty for homosexuality, sex between men and boys is viewed with some toleration in the culture, causing confusion as to whether the resulting relationships are consensual or forced. The case is further complicated by the fact allegations of sexual misconduct against powerful officials are unheard of in the Islamic Republic. According to the reformist Amad News, officials held a twohour emergency meeting with the judiciary following outcries over the broadcast. The initial intent to bury the story failed after it reached the national press and resulted in Toosi now being charged. Judiciary chief Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani, whom the victims audio showed conspiring with Khamenei to cover up the incidents, defended the regimes handling of the case, London Guardian reported. Larijani called for punishment of those who cooperated with hostile media in the VOA story, so we know who is loyal to the revolution and who is not. The case has been given to a judge for a ruling, though there will be no public trial. Awad News reports members of the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution are planning to assassinate Toosi to end the scandal and save the regimes reputation. Toosi, who has denied the charges against him  calling them total lies meant to discredit Irans religious institutions and the ayatollah  is reportedly threatening to release the names of 100 of Irans top officials he claims are implicated in the rape and molestation of children, if the prosecution proceeds.",bias

"Bellwether Trump kippas outselling Hillary yarmulkes Company sees preference as early exit poll of Orthodox Jews Published 9 mins ago Print WASHINGTON  The campaigns of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are looking for signs anywhere and everywhere that might suggest who will move into the White House in January. A company that makes Trump and Hillary kippas or yarmulkes has some good news for one of the presidential hopefuls  Trump head coverings are winning in a landslide among the Orthodox Jewish clientele. So far, the company, PicAKippa, has sold 331 Trump yarmulkes to 65 for Clinton. My kippa yarmulke company sells Trump and Hillary kippas and are keeping track of who is selling more, Uri Turk, founder and chief kippa officer, told WND. We see it as an early exit poll of the Orthodox Jews, a type of bellwether of where this important community is leaning. Once the first debate came around, the orders started flying in, with much more interest in the Trump kippas. PicAKippa is the brainstorm of two former elite red beret IDF soldiers from Miami. Turk says the company is the leader in the kippa market and has been selling Trump and Hillary custom kippas on its site since August, all the while keeping a running tally of which one has sold more. Our mission is to help Jews everywhere show and wear their Jewish pride, with our beautifully unique and completely customizable picture kippas, the company says on its website. It donates 10 percent of every kippa sale to the Lone Soldier Center in Israel, assisting young lone soldiers during difficult times. Turk said while American Jews have leaned heavily Democratic for decades, the past few presidential races have seen Orthodox Jews, who make up over 10 percent of American Jewry, vote Republican in ever increasing numbers. He attributes that fact to the Democrats putting daylight between America and Israel. A number of influential Jewish proTrump organizations have emerged, chief among them Jews Choose Trump and Jewish Democrats For Trump. A recent poll of Florida Jews showed Orthodox voters are leaning toward Trump by a 31 margin. According to Turk, PicAKippa has sold many Trump kippas to a congregant of Ivanka Trumps synagogue on the liberal Upper East Side of Manhattan and has gotten orders for Trump kippas from Israel, Australia, Britain and even Mexico. PicAKippa has also gotten hate mail from Jews unhappy they are selling the Trump designs, he says.",bias

According to Dr. Ted Baehr, founder of Movieguide,  Hero is an excellent movie about God turning a mans heart to his son and a son learning to forgive his father. Dr. Baehr added, The opening is powerful. The ending is heartrending. The drama, the acting, the jeopardy work well throughout the whole movie. This is one of the few movies that Movieguide can actually say go see it. Keith Harris and Nick Edwards as Wynn and Sammy Heller Hero opens with Joe played by Burgess Jenkins coaching his son Davids baseball team, the Gappers, to the state championship. Seven years later, after pursuing his dream job, Joe returns to town. He had left to pursue fame and fortune to support the family. His wife, Hannah, is stricken with cancer, while David is angry that Joe left them. After Hannahs funeral, Joe moves back into the house, but David remains bitter. Meanwhile, David is coaching the now hapless Gappers the team loses more than it wins. Joe steps in to get other fathers involved with their sons and turn the team of losers into winners, hoping this gesture will help Joe reconcile with David. Unfortunately, the league rules have softened dramatically, making it nearly impossible to train the team properly practice times are limited, coaches cant make players take laps around the field, everyone gets a participation trophy.

Unlike many of the absent fathers outside the prison walls, the inmate father has a great desire to practice baseball with his son, but he cannot due to prison rules. Justin Miles and Burgess Jenkins as David and Joe Finn in the film, Every Boy Needs a Hero What makes Hero particularly compelling today is that it addresses the growing crisis of absentee fathers and its impact on baseball itself.

From the director of Isaiah 910 Judgment and the producer of Alone Not Yet Alone comes Hero, a beautiful tale of the significance of the fatherchild relationship thats and set around Americas pastime, baseball. Richardson writes Kevin Stuart, executive director of the Austin Institute, said fathers are natural teachers of baseball because it takes two to play catch. There is a longstanding connection between fatherhood and baseball, Mr. Stuart said, pointing to famous fatherson tandems who have played in the Major Leagues and the prominence of fatherson relationships in popular baseball movies such as Field of Dreams. Baseball, he said, was made to be played by fathers and sons. Baseball seems to fall somewhere in the middle, where whats really necessary, or what appears to us to be necessary in order to really improve skills, is at least one other person deeply and personally committed on a regular basis to working with you, Mr. Stuart said. Anecdotal evidence seems to corroborate the studys connection between fatherhood and baseball. Famous fatherson tandems  including Ken Griffey Sr. and Ken Griffey Jr., Prince Fielder and Cecil Fielder, and Tony Gwynn Sr. and Tony Gwynn Jr.  have talked about how the game was handed down from one generation to the next.

"Judge warns of dangers of appointed judiciary Unelected and unaccountable ... rule on their empathetic feelings Published 4 mins ago About   Archive Bob Unruh joined WND in 2006 after nearly three decades with the Associated Press, as well as several Upper Midwest newspapers, where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists. He is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially. Print A member of the increasingly divided and disputatious Alabama Supreme Court is warning that judges need to be elected and thus accountable to the voters or their decisions end up being based on their empathetic feelings instead of the law. Alabamas judges are elected and accountable, wrote Justice Tom Parker this week. Federal judges, as recently noted by Chief Justice Roberts in his dissent in Obergefell v. Hodges  a case in which five lawyers on the United States Supreme Court announced a fundamental right to samesex marriage, are unaccountable and unelected. He pointed out that three of the four dissenting U.S. Supreme Court justices in Obergefell noted on eight different occasions that the five lawyers who decided Obergefell were unelected. Chief Justice Roberts said on two occasions that those unelected five lawyers were, consequently, unaccountable. Parker previously commented that the five lawyers failed to base their decision on legal reasoning, history, tradition, the courts own rules, or the rule of law, but upon their empathetic feelings. Obergefell is the product of unelected and unaccountable judges, he said. He was arguing over a decision by the state court on its next move in a case brought by Chief Justice Roy Moore, who was suspended for his actions regarding a marriagebased case that the court was reviewing when the Obergefell case, which created samesex marriage nationwide, was announced. Moore, who is challenging the punishment, insisted that the state court justices who previously were involved in his case recuse themselves. They did, with the exception of the acting chief justice who was allowed to work with the governor to pick a panel of retired judges to hear Moores arguments. Parker said active judges should have been included in the panel, because retired judges, too, are unelected and unaccountable. Unelected and unaccountable judges are empowered to impose their agenda, instead of faithfully applying the rule of law, Parker warned. Obergefell is not the first case concerning samesex marriage to prove this principle true. Before the United States Supreme Court decided Obergefell, the constitutionality of state laws defining marriage as between one man and one woman had been litigated before numerous courts throughout the United States. Dont miss Phyllis Schlaflys book, now available autographed at the WND Superstore Who Killed The American Family Before Obergefell, 40 states passed laws affirming traditional marriage. In 37 of those states, the traditional marriage laws were challenged in the courts as unconstitutional. Of the 37 state laws affirming traditional marriage that were challenged in the courts, 24 of those laws were struck down by the judiciary as unconstitutional. Each of the 24 courts that struck down the traditional marriage laws as unconstitutional was composed of judges who were unelected and thus unacountable. He explained what happens when activist judges are held to account, citing the situation that developed in Iowa. The Supreme Court of Iowa was one of the unelected courts that struck down Iowas traditional marriage law as unconstitutional. The judges of the Supreme Court of Iowa are appointed by the governor of Iowa. However, although the judges are initially appointed, they must stand for retention elections once their initial term expires. He explained that after the Iowa Legislature adopted onemanonewoman marriage as law, in April 2009, in a decision largely viewed as judicial activism, the Supreme Court of Iowa unanimously overruled the democratic will of the people of Iowa and held the law unconstitutional. The very next year, three of the judges  who had concurred in Varnum had to stand for a retention election all three were removed from office by vote of the people of Iowa. This was the first time since Iowa adopted its retentionelection system that any judge had ever failed to be retained. The people of Iowa held accountable those judges who failed to uphold the rule of law. Mathew Staver, chairman of of Liberty Counsel, which is representing Moore, said huge questions remain of impropriety regarding the judicial systems handling of Moores case. Chief Justice Moore is merely asking for the same thing any citizen is entitled to receive  equal justice under the law. He wants his case to be heard by an objective and fair panel of judges who will adhere to the rule of law, he said. The people of Alabama have increasingly called upon their judges to be accountable. At every turn, this case presents new twists and turns that have never occurred in the history of Alabama. Never has there been a requirement that replacement judges all be retired. We hope this case moves quickly to a final and just resolution. The Court of the Judiciary violated the law when it suspended Chief Justice Moore for life even though it lacked the 90 vote. Never before under the unanimity requirement of COJ Rule 16 has any judge ever been suspended for the rest of the term. A sexting judge gets six months and a judge who writes a fourpage order that is not unethical or unlawful gets suspended for life. This is not right. Supporters of Moore also have filed an ethics complaint against Lyn Stuart, who has been acting as Alabamas chief justice. She is accused of violating multiple cannons of ethics in her mishandling of the cases surrounding Chief Justice Roy Moore. The complaint comes from the Sanctity of Marriage Alabama organization. If the Judicial Inquiry commission really cares about ethics, fairness and upholding the integrity and impartiality of the Alabama judiciary, they will no doubt take our complaint seriously, as will organizations which filed ethics complaints on Chief Justice Moore, said Tom Ford, a spokesman for the group. The complaints, the group said, outline how acting Chief Justice Lyn Stuart has repeatedly failed to avoid impropriety or the appearance of impropriety, failed to perform the duties of her office impartially, failed to avoid conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute, and failed to conduct herself at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. Parker was not the first to cite the dangers of the judiciary. Daniel Horowitz , senior editor at Conservative Review, told WND that the nation is going through a social transformation without representation. It is the unelected branches of government that are deciding our most important issues, whether its the bureaucrats, whether its the courts, and as it relates to even religious liberty, even property rights, immigration, our voting rights, who gets to vote, he said. Horowitz tackles the topic of social transformation without representation in his book Stolen Sovereignty How to Stop Unelected Judges From Transforming America. How did we get here Horowitz asked rhetorically. And the sad reality is nobody ever voted for this. This was all foisted upon the people by unelected judges, the legal profession, and unelected bureaucrats. That is social transformation without representation, which, as Scalia warned, is something much worse than even taxation without representation that served as the impetus for our first American Revolution. Samesex marriage was mandated for the nation in 2015 by the bare 54 majority made up of Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and the late Antonin Scalia opposed it. The majority found in the Constitution a right to samesex marriage, overturning millennia of established legal precedent regarding marriage as well as the will of tens of millions of voters in dozens of states. It elicited remarkably harsh criticism of the five justices in the U.S. Supreme Court majority. For one, two of the justices in the majority, Kagan and Ginsburg, were asked to recuse themselves from the case because they had openly advocated for samesex marriage, apparently violating standards to preserve judicial impartiality. Without their votes, the case would have gone the other way. They refused. Then there was the U.S. Supreme Courts own opinion just two years earlier, in the Defense of Marriage Act case, in which the court said states have exclusive power over marriage. And there also are those who point out that the Constitution doesnt mention marriage but does dictate that everything not mentioned in the document is left to the states and the people. As WND reported , Ginsburg, who voted in favor of samesex marriage, has performed samesex wedding ceremonies and made supportive public statements. Justice Elena Kagan also has performed samesex weddings and promoted gay rights at Harvards law school while she was at its helm. Critics contend the two justice appear to be violating judicial ethics rules that require recusal from a case in which there is even the appearance of a conflict of interest. The Foundation for Moral Law asked the justices to excuse themselves from the case, but they refused to acknowledge the request. The Foundation explained that Canon 3A6 of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges provides A judge should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court. 28 U.S.C. sec 455a mandates that a justice shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned. Rabbi Jonathan Cahn, author of the New York Times bestseller The Harbinger and the inspiration behind the Isaiah 910 Judgment movie, has criticized the Supreme Courts assumption that it has the authority to redefine marriage. At a prayer event in Washington, he said The justices of the Supreme Court took up their seats in a hearing on whether they should strike down the biblical and historic definition of marriage. That the event should even take place is a sign this is America of George Washingtons warning  a nation at war against its own foundation. Washington warned the smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself hath ordained. Justices, can you judge the ways of God There is another court and there is another judge, where all men and all judges will give account, he warned. If a nations high court should pass judgment on the Almighty, should you then be surprised God will pass judgment on the court and that nation We are doing that which Israel did on the altars of Baal, he said. See Jonathans Cahns message at Washington Man of Prayer event at the Capitol. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops is calling samesex marriage an intrinsic evil. And officials from several counties in Tennessee have adopted statements opposing the Supreme Court. WND also reported when dozens of top legal scholars from the likes of Washington  Lee, Boston College, Kansas State, Notre Dame, University of Texas, Villanova, Vanderbilt, Hillsdale, University of Nebraska, Catholic University and Regent University issued a statement encouraging all state and federal officials to treat the Supreme Courts recent creation of samesex marriage as anticonstitutional and illegitimate. It cannot  be taken to have settled the law of the United States, said the statement from the American Principles Project .

"Bellwether Trump kippas outselling Hillary yarmulkes Company sees preference as early exit poll of Orthodox Jews Published 24 mins ago Print WASHINGTON  The campaigns of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are looking for signs anywhere and everywhere that might suggest who will move into the White House in January. A company that makes Trump and Hillary kippas or yarmulkes has some good news for one of the presidential hopefuls  Trump head coverings are winning in a landslide among the Orthodox Jewish clientele. So far, the company, PicAKippa, has sold 331 Trump yarmulkes to 65 for Clinton. My kippa yarmulke company sells Trump and Hillary kippas and are keeping track of who is selling more, Uri Turk, founder and chief kippa officer, told WND. We see it as an early exit poll of the Orthodox Jews, a type of bellwether of where this important community is leaning. Once the first debate came around, the orders started flying in, with much more interest in the Trump kippas. PicAKippa is the brainstorm of two former elite red beret IDF soldiers from Miami.

Our mission is to help Jews everywhere show and wear their Jewish pride, with our beautifully unique and completely customizable picture kippas, the company says on its website. It donates 10 percent of every kippa sale to the Lone Soldier Center in Israel, assisting young lone soldiers during difficult times. Turk said while American Jews have leaned heavily Democratic for decades, the past few presidential races have seen Orthodox Jews, who make up over 10 percent of American Jewry, vote Republican in ever increasing numbers. He attributes that fact to the Democrats putting daylight between America and Israel. A number of influential Jewish proTrump organizations have emerged, chief among them Jews Choose Trump and Jewish Democrats For Trump. A recent poll of Florida Jews showed Orthodox voters are leaning toward Trump by a 31 margin. According to Turk, PicAKippa has sold many Trump kippas to a congregant of Ivanka Trumps synagogue on the liberal Upper East Side of Manhattan and has gotten orders for Trump kippas from Israel, Australia, Britain and even Mexico. PicAKippa has also gotten hate mail from Jews unhappy they are selling the Trump designs, he says.",bias

"Print When Judith Gait met Father X, it was a lopsided grief that drew them together. He had lost his only chance at fatherhood through an abortion years ago. Gait is a married mother of five, and longterm American resident in Britain. Her support of the prolife movement is driven by thankfulness and praise for life and her Christian faith. Witnessing abortions heavy toll on the living and dead, Gait began to make the paintings almost no one else seemed to be doing. Subtle and working entirely with symbolism, these simple artworks avoid screaming about abortion. Rather, they mourn in color, symbol and tone with single shoes, broken cord, dead flowers and other lonely and broken things. Troubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seaspainting by Judith Gait, commentary by Father X When a friend first visited Gaits studio, he was struck by her abortion paintings. Confessing years of torment after his partner aborted his child, he wrote I realize your work comes from a place of great love, for it attempts to give defenseless life the dignity and protection it never knew in our throw away culture. Gait invited him to pray with her for his lost child. It happened to be the anniversary of the death of his baby, five years to the day. Father X remembers every detail. Their conversation grew into a joint effort, culminating in a book,  Troubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas Meditations on Post Abortion Trauma . Father X wanted to remain anonymous, as a placesetter for millions of unconsidered fathers in the acts of abortion. He wrote poetic and powerful statements for each of Gaits 30 paintings in this book, which have also been shown together in art exhibits. Time and neglect does not necessarily heal the wounds of abortion, Gait claims. Rather, the past refocuses into a sharper image and the pain through an iterative process of silence, guilt and remorse has not abated. You can see that in the words of Father X, which run the gamut of human emotions. On Abortion Shoe, Pot and Crossesfrom Troubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas Jonah of Nineveh features an upended, single rose with red cords and funereal foliage. Flowers are already in the birth position, head down and waiting to be born. Torn and shroudlike ribbons hang across the painting. Spirals represent a childs DNA helix and the veil of the Temple which has just been so rudely shaken down to its foundation. Father X makes an analogy between Jonah fleeing parental responsibility and eventual redemption  then veers off to his own personal engulfment in almost a stream of consciousness It was her wedding dress, my sea green empress, this blue lagoon princess she slipped into her own heart of darkness on that day she decided to abort and when time really stopped in our lives. She was full of fear.  In some of these works, hammers incongruently hang with flowers. They are bloody or blackened, some submerged underwater or hanging from a noose. Father X interprets these tools as decision markers, to either build or tear down. In Hammer of Decision, it belongs to Thor, the war god infested with his one eyed wisdom of intrigue and destruction. Wagner, the Olympics, sperm races, Thomas Moore and Valkyries are all inducted into this choice by the author. Either the Carpenters hammer of wisdom or Thors tool of chaos will be chosen by expectant parents. Hammer, Suspended  Troubadours  runs from elegant poetry to sentiment over babies and an ad hoc theology. Striving to extend lives of children lost to abortion, the authors create a fantasy universe of possibilities. This includes moonlighting for angels, celestial games, interstellar windjammers and a baby steamer sailing on childrens seas, among other delightful prospects. Lost and murdered infants in these tales pine for love or for a family in their Limbos. Father X occasionally speculates on spiritual issues outside the Bible or the treatment of abortion in other religions. Running from nursery rhymes and quotes to historical characters, these are not theological statements, but a type of literary yearning that seeks an answer to abortion. In Gaits Pink Rose and Stardust, we see empty fields, withered plants and other tokens. Father X takes off from here on fanciful trips for the lost children. He places them in a cosmic waiting rooms or dancing in circles, which is reflected in the painting. Children are disfigured, or missing eyes or arms and singing in low mournful tones so as not to disturb their parents. Music is intense, equivalent to the sound created by Hildegard von Bingen a 12thcentury nun and composer. Troubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seaspainting by Judith Gait, commentary by Father X References to Mary as a mother are common, as well as other scriptural allusions. All babies jump for Jesus in the womb or in its sack of nibbling yoke writes Father X. Elizabeths child John leapt for joy, just as his ancestor David did before the ark of the covenant, he continues. Gait addresses the human embryo, finding Biblical, ethical or emotional arguments for its worth at all stages. Her Abbey Target Beginning has a crosshair target, which is interpreted spiritually The first target blastula conflates the first cellular divisions with the laver bread  the bread on fire with the Holy Spirit the same stage of development as the child in Marys womb when she arrived at her cousin Elizabeths house. Postabort guilt isnt rationalized or downplayed, but emotionally reacted to in art and word. Father X describes bats as whirling about in circles at the pitiful sound the aborted children make because they are tuned to such distressing signals. This contrasts with many parents who are still stone deaf to such mournful sounds. At another point, FatherX imputes the collective white noise of guilt to attacks of tinnitus, a roar of unwanted thoughts. Troubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seaspainting by Judith Gait, commentary by Father X Father X elaborates on what Gait hints in her paintings the injustice and evil of abortion. He cites a world built on slavery before Christs advent, and the works of such men as William Wilberforce and John Brown in furthering Christs gospel of justice and peace. All this is contrasted to abortion throughout. Ruminating on Gaits Palms of our Lord, Father X claims the face of the baby is in the midst of the ruins of the abortion. Palms is murky, with a single, red hand print. To look at the after birth of an abortion is to read the Tarot of Ruins, he continues. Suicide advances this dark theme, where Gait and Father X criticize the death industry and its euphemistically named clinics. He takes a few swings at the girl gangs of the glass ceilings  a caricature of a woman who made a mistake, who got herself in trouble, who has had an abortion and afterwards committed suicide in her heart. But all isnt baleful and sad here. In Cloud Children, Father X muses on paper dolls in Gaits paintings with this lovely thought Where children go  is a mystery.  Some say they take their daytime rest in Christs tomb in Jerusalem, and like him when their time is come they will ascend into heaven before a quire of angels and assembled Star Ships.  Troubadours Sailing Hibiscus Seas  is a work of meditation, grief counseling, poetry, social commentary and visual art. Father X may not reveal his identity here, but the reader comes to know intimate details about relationships and emotions surrounding the death of his only child. Gait and Father X describe their efforts as a silent prayer of witness for all the ghost families, those Phantoms of Sorrows, who will never laugh or cry together as a family, because of an abortion. They hope that prying open the tightly locked matter of abortion will help to heal those who have had abortions or are victimized in some way. Judith Gait is a graduate of California College of Arts and Crafts and received a Masters at Oxfords Ruskin School of Fine Drawing. Her work is in public and private collections in America and abroad. She is an American citizen, residing in Britain.

The full weight of the penalty will not be felt until April, when those who have avoided buying insurance will face penalties of around 700 a person or more.

"21st Century Wire says 21WIRE reported on Friday about the FBIs surprising announcement that it would be reopening the Clinton email case due to new evidence of classified information found on sex cheat Anthony Weiners newly estranged husband of Clinton chief aid Huma Abedin computer which was subject to a seperate investigation. Will this really yield anything significant in the 10 days runningup to the Nov 8th election, or is this just clever Democrat party smoke and mirrors It seems that Washingtons political tricksters have already sprung into action After Comeys shock announcement, a leaked memo appeared out of nowhere, supplied to Fox News , in which Comey and the FBI seem to be going through a routine set of prescribed political moves designed to implement damage control. ELITE CIRCLES FBI head James Comey and friend Hillary Clinton. Certainly, a desperate Democratic Party, and an even more desperate Obama White House over the last 3 weeks, Obama and his wife Michelle have been out campaigning more that Hillary Clinton herself, could be pressuring or nudging the FBI on this volatile issue which could easily tilt a close presidential race against Donald Trump. Aside from the obvious potential of another Clinton scandal, yesterdays FBI move could also be a prelude to the following possible scenarios Protect the President, who is already deeply tied to the Clinton email coverup Democratic Party Machine has created a distraction to coverup latest Wikileaks dump. FBI are trying to restore lost public confidence over allegations of favoring Hillary Clintons. Create a controlled explosion this weekend to clear the decks for another salacious Trump scandal next week. NOTE Despite calls from the Clinton camp for FBI to disclose what they have which they cannot by law anyway, youd think Hillary would have already known that, it is highly unlikely that the FBI will release any real specifics before the election  if they have anything at all. Its just too early to tell. SEE ALSO FBI James Comey was board member of HSBC  Clinton Foundation  Drug Cartel bank of choice The FBI director stoked outrage last month when he announced that he would not recommend the Justice Department seek an indictment against Clinton or any of the other parties to the investigation  allowing Clinton to dodge any criminal probe before the election  despite the fact that Comey stated to a Congressional investigative committee that Clinton was extremely careless, and that Clinton openly lied about her handling classified information on her unsecured private server throughout her tenure as the US Secretary of State. Zero Hedge adds Now, it is the democrats turn to rage at Comey and the FBI, although Comey likely did not have much choice had he kept the information secret, it certainly would have leaked as we predicted as such his best recourse was to come clean, although many have speculated about the cryptic nature of the disclosure. Needless to say, all Comey would need to do to regain the Demcorats trust and favor is to announce in just a few days that nothing material has been found and that the second probe is also over.

"In a stunning turn of events 11 days before the 2016 presidential election, the FBI announced it is reopenning its investigation into Hillary Clintons email server case, by probing newly emerging emails linked to Hillary Clinton. NEW PROBE The FBI gives Hillary Clinton a second look. Photo illustraion 21WIRE FBI October Surprise According to reports , in a letter written today, FBI Director James Comey , stated that the FBI has begun a new probe into Hillary Clinton related emails once again. Comey offered scant details about the new probe, but due to an unrelated case, additional classified material may have been mishandled on Clintons personal email server. CNBC reported the latest FBI developments, including a passage from Comeys letter discussing the new investigation In previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clintons personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony, Comey wrote. In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation, he added. Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony, Comey concluded. Humas Estranged Sexting Husband According to a new report released via The New York Times  The presidential campaign was rocked on Friday after federal law enforcement officials said that emails pertinent to the nowclosed investigation into Hillary Clinton s private email server were discovered on a computer belonging to Anthony D. Weiner, the estranged husband of a top Clinton aide.  In a letter to Congress , the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said the emails had surfaced in an unrelated case, which law enforcement officials said was an F.B.I. investigation into illicit text messages from Mr. Weiner to a 15yearold girl in North Carolina. Mr. Weiner, a former Democratic congressman from New York, is married to Huma Abedin, the top aide. Comey has come under fire recently for apparently letting Clinton off the hook for mishandling, and lying to Congress, about classified emails coming through her home brew email server while she was Secretary of State. After previously closing the case, Comey has done a Uturn and is now saying the FBI will review the new emails to for classified information, and see whether it was mishandled. This unprecedented investigative move comes just two days after a Wikileaks docudump revealed a memo containing detailed financial information between Clinton Foundation donors and former president Bill Clinton s private financial activities. Among those included in the memo, was a 30 million dollar business arrangement under Bill Clinton, Inc., with another 66 million dollar deal scheduled over nine years. The following is a tweet from Brad Jaffy of NBC Nightly News containing the new FBI recommendation The new investigation into the Clinton camp will most certainly spark new PaytoPlay allegations , as the new FBI revelations also comes days after a Project Veritas hidden camera sting operation revealed that the Democratic consultant Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners, discussed ways to commit largescale voter fraud as well as paying political agitators to cause violence at Donald Trump rallies. Out of Creamers 342 visits to the White House, also included his wife, a 9term Illinois Democratic congresswoman, Jan Schakowsky some 47 times. White House visitor records show that Schakowsky took 47 private meetings with Obama or his senior staff, also over the past year. The consultancy Democracy Partners appears to have applied Schakowsky as a political buffering point, possibly in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level. The impetus of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain highranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics  thus giving a political campaign or political entity plausible deniability. CAUGHT ON FILM  Robert Creamer resigns over a massive Democratic Party controversy. Image Source CNN  Creamer, a convicted felon , in 2005, Creamer plead guilty 2.3 million in bank fraud and tax violations was promptly shoved out of the Hillary Clinton campaigns inner circle, following a heavily publicized video sting revealing his discussion about voter fraud and violence at Trump rallies. PAY TO PLAY Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe closely allied with the Clintons negotiated a a campaign contribution involving the FBI. Image Source new republic  It remains unclear what exactly reopened the new Clinton probe, but perhaps the FBI had its own cobwebs to clear out after it was revealed that a longtime Clinton associate , Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe , helped steer 675,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an FBI official who went on to lead the probe into Hillary Clintons use of a private email system, according to a report. The NY Post also reported on the matter this past week The political action committee of McAuliffe, the Clinton loyalist, gave 467,500 to the state Senate campaign of the wife of Andrew McCabe, who is now deputy director of the FBI, according to the Wall Street Journal . The report states Jill McCabe received an additional 207,788 from the Virginia Democratic Party, which is heavily influenced by McAuliffe. The money directed by McAuliffe began flowing two months after the FBI investigation into Clinton began in July 2015. Around that time, the candidates husband was promoted from running the Washington field office for the FBI to the No. 3 position at the bureau. In a CNN report from October 18th, a week before the McAuliffe revelations, According to notes from interviews conducted during an FBI investigation into Clintons email practices, Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy personally tried to convince FBI officials that the email should be declassified. One interviewee described feeling pressured by another FBI official at Kennedys request. The newly reopened FBI investigation into Clinton could be related to all or some of the items listed above, but theres no doubt that due to public backlash the FBI received following the first Clinton investigation, in addition to concerns over dealings between the FBI and Clinton associates  the agency needed to save face. It remains to be seen how new case will impact the US Presidential election. More from RT below ",conspiracy
"A tidal wave of revelations is pouring out of the Clinton campaign as the 2016 presidential election draws to a close. MELTDOWN The Clinton campaign continues to unravel following a series of troubling details. Photo illustration 21WIRE Over the weekend, it was discovered through a Wikileaks email dump, that Neera Tanden of the Center for American Progress , John Podesta s top aide, had an email exchange with Michael Lux of Progressive Strategies revealing that the Democratic consultant Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners, was closely allied with Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook . POLITICAL BOMBSHELL Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook had close ties to disgraced DNC consultant Robert Creamer. Image Source Lockerdome  Creamer gained national attention when he became the subject of video sting operation captured by the investigative nonprofit Project Veritas . Not only was it revealed that the Creamer discussed ways to commit voter fraud and violence at Donald Trump rallies on camera  he also met with White House officials some 342 times over the past year, including 47 private meetings with President Obama or other senior officials. DNC SCANDAL Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners and Democratic congresswoman Jan Schakowsky. Image Source National Vanguard  Creamers visits to the White House also included his wife, a 9term Illinois Democratic congresswoman Jan Schakowsky . White House visitor records have shown that Schakowsky took 47 private meetings with Obama or his senior staff, over the past year. The consultancy Democracy Partners appears to have applied Schakowsky as a political buffering point, in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level. The nature of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain highranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics , potentially giving the Clinton campaign and the DNC plausible deniability. The Mook fallout is the latest in a laundry list of problems for the Clinton campaign and comes at a time when interim DNC chair Donna Brazile , is embroiled in controversy of over leaked debate questions prior to at least two 2016 town hall debates. Brazile stepped down from her role at CNN earlier in October. Heres a passage from the Daily Caller describing the scenario Donna Brazile, the interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, began providing town hall and debate questions to the Clinton campaign earlier than previously known, emails released by WikiLeaks on Monday show. The article continued by stating that the revelations expose that the interim DNC chair was more deeply involved than previously outlined In the March 12 exchange, Brazile mentions Roland Martin by name and offers to provide more than just the one town hall question that she is known to have shared with the campaign. Ill send a few more. Though some questions Roland submitted, Brazile wrote to Palmieri in the March 12 email thread, which is entitled From time to time I get the questions in advance. Martin, is a commentator for TV One and the host of News One Now , as well as a CNN contributor. In another matter, the Wall Street Journal revealed the following , while disclosing an apparently contentious relationship between the FBI and DOJ, while the FBI appears to be somewhat fractured over the latest email server case developments The latest development began in early October when New Yorkbased FBI officials notified Andrew McCabe of the Terry McAuliffe campaign contribution scandal, the bureaus secondincommand, that while investigating Mr. Weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a teenage minor, they had recovered a laptop. Many of the 650,000 emails on the computer, they said, were from the accounts of Ms. Abedin, according to people familiar with the matter. Some critics have called for McCabe to recuse himself after it was revealed his wife received 675,000 from a wellknown Clinton confidant, Terry McAuliffe . This was further underlined after the House Oversight Commitee wanted more information about the Senate campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe and its ties to the Clintons. The alleged internal feud among agencies was compounded when Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates objected to FBI Director James Comey reopening the Clinton email server case this past week  something that added to the Lynch/Clinton tarmac meeting before the first FBI ruling in the Clinton case. According to a report filed by Zero Hedge , a close friend of Podesta, Peter Kadzik , the Assistant Attorney General of the Department of Justice DOJ, will be in charge of a probe into Huma Abedin , Clintions closest aide. Interestingly, as a mountain of controversy envelops the Clinton campaign, the FBI is now conducting an early inquiry into former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort , over his alleged foreign business connections. Back in August, the following business connection was revealed by NBC news  In 2008, according to court records, senior Trump aide Paul Manaforts firm was involved with a Ukrainian oligarch named Dmytro Firtash in a plan to redevelop a famous New York hotel, the Drake. The total value of the project was 850 million. Firtashs company planned to invest over 100 million, the records say. That same year, Firtash acknowledged to the U.S. ambassador in Ukraine that he got his start in business with the permission of a notorious Russian crime lord, according to a classified State Department cable. Other cables say Firtash made part of his fortune through sweetheart natural gas deals between Russia and the Ukraine. Although the US State Department has determined that Firtash may have ties to a criminal enterprise in Russia  so far, theres nothing directly linking Manafort to any underground element at this time. Watch this space  as the Russia/Trump meme fostered by mainstream media or some other politically polarizing element will look to deflect from the Clinton campaign meltdown.

"November 1, 2016 By 21wire 4 Comments Patrick Henningsen 21st Century Wire The longer this soap opera drags on, its becoming more and more evident that the Russian government did not hack into the DNC, and Moscow is not feeding John Podestas emails to Wikileaks. For those who are deeply invested in this now official conspiracy theory, this might be a hard pill to swallow. The White House and the Hillary Clinton campaign are now married to the idea that Putin is hacking the US elections. In response, the President is weighing his options  tougher economic sanctions, revoking diplomatic status to Russian envoys in the US, or even deploying his newly developed malicious cyberactivity tools. Even VP Joe Biden wants in on the action, threatening Moscow by saying,Were sending a message. We have the capacity to do it. It seems that where ever you turn nowadays, someone in Washington is issuing a threat against Russia. Are USRussian relations really that bad, or does this trend have more to do with the defense industry and power struggles within the US What was previously a stance reserved for rightwing neoconservative hawks and Cold War holdouts has now infected Americas leftwing, and is a firm plank in the Democratic Party platform, as evidenced by Hillary Clintons constant antiRussian rhetoric throughout this 2016 election cycle. Along with the White House, Clinton has now transformed the Democrats into the vanguard of Washingtons new antiRussia movement. On July 27th, Josh Rogin from the Washington Post wrote, The Clinton campaign has decided to escalate its rhetoric on Russia. After Trump suggested Wednesday that if Russia had indeed hacked Clintons private email server it should release the emails, the Clinton campaign sent out its Democratic surrogates to bash Russia and Trump in a manner traditionally reserved for Republicans. Anyone who was paying attention back then knew this Russian hack talking point was purely political, but then again, whos really paying attention these days Certainly not the US media. You can trace the genesis of the Democratic Partys hardcore antiRussian strategy back to when President Vladimir Putin made a mild passing remark about Donald Trumps GOP primary success. From that point on, Trumps political opponents saw this as an open target. In their words, comparing one dictator to another. Never one to pass up an opportunity to score cheap political points, President Obama got in on the act, intensifying the TrumpPutin narrative to the level of bromance . If youve made a career out of idealizing Ronald Reagan, then where were you when your own partys nominee for president was kissing up to Vladimir Putin said Obama on Oct 20th at a Clinton rally in Miami. Backed by the Obama White House, Clinton and the media felt they had a green light to keep pressing ahead with blaming Russia  not only for the controversial DNC leaks, but also for hacking into US election systems in Arizona  a charge devoid of any evidence other than innuendo and speculation. The medias coverage on this issue was deceptive from the onset. In a leading news release, entitled,  Russian hackers targeted Arizona election system , we can see how after the cocksure headline, the first paragraph would always sound definitive Hackers targeted voter registration systems in Illinois and Arizona, and the FBI alerted Arizona officials in June that Russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state. But then by the time you advanced down the story, the report would quickly retreat into a zone of uncertainty The bureau described the threat as credible and significant, an eight on a scale of one to 10, Matt Roberts, a spokesman for Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan R, said Monday. As a result, Reagan shut down the states voter registration system for nearly a week. And then, down to almost nothing It turned out that the hackers had not compromised the state system or even any county system. They had, however, stolen the username and password of a single election official in Gila County. At no point was any evidence ever given. Only ambiguous statements like, Cyber security officials agree that this looks very much like a Russian governmentdirected hack. Are American politicians so callous as to tempt geopolitical conflict in order to further their shortterm political ambitions Better yet, has American political life really arrived in such a dark cul de sac translated in French bottom of the bag where politicians in power are so insecure as to makeup and propagate wild international conspiracy theories  in the middle a national election cycle Its a very depressing prospect, and yet, this is exactly what we are seeing in this 2016 Presidential Election. Behind Clintons wild hyperbolic rants about the Kremlin and Wikileaks, you will find the White House On October 7th, the Obama Administration formally accused the Russian government of stealing emails from the Democratic National Committee and other highprofile individuals including Hillary Clintons campaign manager John Podesta  giving them to Wikileaks. Soon, there was a queue of national security politicians eager to hitch a ride on this bandwagon. Senator Ben Sasse NER, a member of the Homeland Security Committee spouted out, Russia must face serious consequences. Moscow orchestrated these hacks because Russian President Vladimir Putin believes Sovietstyle aggression is worth it. The United States must upend Putins calculus with a strong diplomatic, political, cyber and economic response. According to a Washington Post report by technology editor, Ellen Nakashima , the only evidence that seems to be available on this story is a corporate analysis of the alleged Russian government hacks provided by a US cyber security company called Crowdstrike . No actual specifics are given, so we are meant to take private firm Crowdstrikes word for it. IMAGE Crowdstrike cyber security. The Posts Nakashima then added The administration also blamed Moscow for the hack of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the subsequent leak of private email addresses and cellphone numbers of Democratic lawmakers. An online persona calling himself Guccifer 2.0 has claimed responsibility for posting the material. Those sites and that persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russiandirected efforts, the joint statement said.  We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russias seniormost officials could have authorized these activities. Moscows press secretarys reply This is some sort of nonsense, said Dmitry Peskov. Despite the constant repetition by Democrat media surrogates, and as CNNs Maria Cardona said last night, no US national intelligence agency has really confirmed that Russia was behind the email hacks  and still no evidence , other than speculative guesswork, has been presented. Likewise, US intelligence agencies have never actually said definitively on record that Russia did it, thus, leaving the door open to walkback the accusation at a later date. Standard Washington procedure of ambiguity. This little detail doesnt seem to matter in this hyperbolic political climate though. It seems that the White House, Hillary Clinton and media operatives like Cardona  are quite happy living in what John Kerry recent dubbed as a  parallel universe . Still, during the final Presidential debate, Hillary Clinton proudly crowed how  17 US intelligence agencies  aka the Intelligence Community all agreed that Russia did it. The announcement, albeit vague, actually originated from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. We have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election, said Clinton. I find that deeply disturbing. Whats even more disturbing is the fact that Clinton is lying in front of a national audience. The highest levels of the Kremlin Here are Clintons 17 agencies Air Force Intelligence, Army Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, Coast Guard Intelligence, Defense Intelligence Agency, Energy Department, Homeland Security Department, State Department, Treasury Department, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Marine Corps Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, National Security Agency, Navy Intelligence and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. What does the Coast Guard Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency or the Drug Enforcement Administration know about John Podestas emails Answer nothing. The exact same thing happened following Wikileaks first trove of DNC emails back in July 2016 . The US government issued a vague accusatory statement, but would not actually name the culprit. Some might call that propaganda. In both instances, the Obama Administration refused to present any evidence. Translated there was no evidence. If there had been, the White House would have been shouting from the rooftops and using it as leverage to apply muscle in the UN over Washingtons flagging efforts in Syria. Both Obama Administration announcements were nothing more than dog whistles for Democrats and journalists working for hopelessly partisan outlets like New York Times and CNN  none of whom have bothered to press the White House for one ounce of evidence pertaining to the Partys decree that Russian is hacking the US election process. If you actually look at the joint DNIDHS statement issued on the matter, it contains no definitive statement  the hacks are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russiandirected efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow  the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russias seniormost officials could have authorized these activities. According to NSA intelligence workerturned whistleblower William Binney , when asked about WikiLeaks and whether the Russians are hacking US elections, he concluded that the cyber efforts against the DNC were more likely to be the work of a  disgruntled U.S. intelligence worker.  Under partisan pressure from senior Democrat Senator Harry Reid , the FBI also initiated another investigation into people linked to the Trump team with Russia. Reid was unset about the DNC hacks and the Podesta emails and demanded the FBI do something about the Trump campaign. To date, the FBI havent come up with anything. To be fair, Hillary would have every reason to believe that the Kremlin is behind the hack  because her staff read it to her from the campaigns daily intelligence briefings, presumably, supplied from the US governments much vaunted Intelligence Community . Of course, thats the same Intelligence Community that briefed George W Bush about Saddams nonexistent nuclear weapons program, and who also briefed Colin Powell about Iraqs imaginary Winnebagos of Death aka mobile anthrax labs disguised as senior doublewide camper vans. So, of course, they would know if Putin directed the DNC leaks and Podesta email hacks. For those us who are skeptical of the great oxymoron known as Washington Intelligence, I can almost hear the mainstream rebuttal now, No, that was Iraq, that was Bush. Were not like that. No, this time its different. This time we are sure the Russians did it In 2014, Obama claimed that Kims notorious Bureau 121 hacked into Sony Pictures. This isnt the first time that President Obama has cried wolf on a foreign hack and then tried to sell it for political purposes. Back in December 2014, Obama claimed that North Korea had hacked Sony Pictures in Hollywood. PentagonCIA media proxy CNN quickly chimed in to support Washingtons conspiracy theory, floating a colorful story that Kim JingUn had deployed a secret underground hacking unit called  Bureau 121 . Just like with todays Russian Hack theory, no member of the mainstream press dared to question the White Houses ridiculous North Korean claim, and like the Russian Hack claims, the only source cited for Sony hack was analysis provided by US firm Crowdstrike . Jumping the Shark After their Democratic Party Convention on July 27th, the Clinton campaign machine put all of its chips on their Putin narrative. Soon after, a cadre of top Clinton national security surrogates then accused Trump of emboldening Russia in their evil plot to destabilize and dominate the West. Tom Donilon, a former national security adviser then accused Russia of interfering with elections all over Europe and then accused Trump is helping Russia directly. At that point, they were in too deep to turn back. The biggest impact of @wikileaks  Shining a spotlight on Russias attempt to undermine American democracy and Trumps refusal to condemn it https//t.co/ALzpYm1Bb5  Josh Schwerin @JoshSchwerin October 21, 2016 Clinton spin doctors Josh Schwerin and Michael Fallon would stoop even lower by accusing RT of having possession of the Podesta emails even before Wikileaks did. Their only evidence seemed to be Twitter posts by RT News which Clinton held up as proof that the Kremlin was frontrunning Wikileaks email dumps. The Clinton braintrust failed to note that the Podesta emails were posted on Wikileaks own website well before RT News had tweeted about them. At that point it became obvious that the Clinton campaign was panicking and hysterically grabbing for any excuse they could get their hands on. We then watched, as one RT reporter after another dismantled the Clinton campaigns desperate claims. It was embarrassing. They could not face the uncomfortable fact that it was WikiLeaks head Julian Assange who chose the timing of the release of the DNC and Podesta emails. Rather than attack Assange himself, who happens to be popular with millennials the very group Clinton struggles to connect with, her operatives opted to target Russia and Trump instead. Either way, the political strategy here is clear  to shoot the messenger . The Clinton campaign is stuck in permanent rearguard mode, because based on the content of both the DNC Leaks, Wikileaks files, and Project Veritas video  their own Democratic Party has been discredited and exposed as a corrupt political organization. Their other big problem is that despite all the outrage from Democrats and their mainstream media surrogates, none of the leaked content has been challenged on the basis of its authenticity. The results speak for themselves. The initial DNC leak of 20,000 emails resulted in the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz . They revealed the unthinkable the Democratic National Committee actively worked to undermine the Presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders in favor of the establishment choice in Hillary Clinton. Sanders never had a chance. Honest commentators called this an affront to the democratic process, while party insiders and Clinton supporters pretended to be aloof as if it never happened. To prove this point, both President Obama and Hillary Clinton then gave WassermanSchultz a glowing endorsement on the way out. For the last eight years, Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had my back. This afternoon, I called her to let her know that I am grateful, said Obama. Not surprisingly, Clinton thanked Wasserman Schultz, presumably for helping to knock her only competitor Sanders out of the Democrat primary race. I am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this years historic convention in Philadelphia, and I know that this weeks events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership, said Clinton. The party had sold its soul to devil and no one seemed to care too much about it. Party Meltdown Wasserman Schultzs replacement didnt fair much better. DNC Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile was installed to serve as interim chair through the remainder election, but Brazile was soon skewered by subsequent Wikileaks batches  showing how, on more than one occasion, she fed debate questions obtained from corrupt mainstream media operatives  straight to Hillary Clinton.  A March 12 email exchange shows Brazile stating that she received a town hall question from Roland Martin, a TV One host who comoderated a March 13 town hall with CNNs Jake Tapper.  A March 5 email shows that she shared a question with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and communications director Jennifer Palmieri that was to be asked in a March 6 debate hosted by CNN in Flint, Mich. Source Daily Caller  Braziles audacious fraud also helped contribute to her partys planned sabotage of Democrat challenger Bernie Sanders. Watch Brazile go into full meltdown when confronted here . Completely corrupt and still, Brazile even had to temerity to deny doing it when pressed on FOX News last week. Braziles reputation is so bad now that even CNN has severed ties with her  and thats saying a lot. In addition, it was also revealed how CNNs head political commentator, Gloria Borger , was named by Podesta as one of a shortlist of journalists the Clinton campaign would work with to gain favorable coverage. Youd think that CNN would have dropped Borger after this was revealed, but no. Amazingly, Borger is still leading CNNs election coverage. Clearly, CNN cannot be trusted to police itself when it comes to matters of outright collusion with Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. Everunbiased CNNs Gloria Borger refers to being in GOP hell and says shell reach out soon to Podesta. Heartwarming #PodestaEmails13 pic.twitter.com/CQFdcJ12Q5  400lb Hacker Owens @NubianAwakening October 21, 2016 Worse Than Watergate Perhaps a bigger scandal which the Obama White House and Clinton campaign operatives would like to bury  is the FBIs investigation into the Clinton Foundation. Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal confirmed the existence of an internal feud between the FBI and the Justice Department, over whether or not to pursue an investigation into Clinton issue Some investigators grew frustrated, viewing FBI leadership as uninterested in probing the charity, these people said. Others involved disagreed sharply, defending FBI bosses and saying Mr. McCabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the Justice Department and FBI agents pursuing the Clinton Foundation case. It isnt unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited. But the internal debates about the Clinton Foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president. Theres more. It was also revealed last week how Jill McCabe, the wife of FBI Deputy Director, Andrew McCabe , received 467,500 in campaign funds in late 2015 for her Virginia State Senate run. This unusually large donation came via a political action committee run by Virginia Gov.Terry McAuliffe  a Clinton Foundation board member. After the funds were donated, Andrew McCabe was then put in charge of the Clinton Email case. In normal times, this one scandal would be bigger than Watergate, but these are not normal times . So why is Washington going all out to deflect to Russia , and coverup the Clinton scandals, and the Wikileaks document dumps One reason is because the Clinton email issue goes all the way to the top  to the President himself. What 21WIRE reported on Oct 21st is how President Obama lied when first confronted about whether or not he knew about the existence of Hillarys unauthorized private server. Obama told CBS News on March 7, 2015 that he only found out about Clintons server the same time everybody else learned it through news reports. The Presidents lie was confirmed when newly released FBI documents showed that Obama used a pseudonym bobama@ameritech.net when communicating with thenSecretary of State Hillary Clinton by email, and at least one of those emails ended up on Clintons private email server. So, not only did Obama lie on national TV, but he also broke strict White House security protocols by carelessly exchanging private emails off grid with Hillary Clinton on a unsecured and unauthorized mail server  maybe to avoid the same scrutiny one would have on a government system. Who knows why he did it. Sure, hes not the first US President to lie, but like, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, Obama just joined that exclusive liars club  caught out lying to the American people. On top of this, any communications made by the President of the United States are de facto labeled as  born classified . The same goes for any State Department communications with other foreign ministers. COVERUP John Podesta and Huma Abedin on the Hillary campaign jet Image ABC News  It should be well known by now after watching both Attorney Generals Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch in action  that the Obama Justice Department DOJ is one of the most politicized in history. Bear that in mind when looking at the latest leg of the Hillary Email case. On Friday, FBI Director James Comey set the election alight after announcing that the FBI would be reopening the Clinton email case  currently examining 650,000 emails found while investigating a laptop belonging to former US Congressman Anthony Weiner estranged husband of top Clinton aid and longtime confidant Huma Abedin who was snared in a sexting scandal, allegedly involving a underaged female. So which DOJ person is in charge of this investigation None other than Assistant Attorney General Peter J. Kadzik . Who is Kadzik Zero Hedge reports Oh yes. Recall our post from last week,  Clinton Campaign Chair Had Dinner With Top DOJ Official One Day After Hillarys Benghazi Hearing  in which we reported that John Podesta had dinner with one of the highest ranked DOJ officials the very day after Hillary Clintons Benghazi testimony It was Peter Kadzik. Oh, and if that wasnt good enough, Kadzik was also Podestas lawyer back in 1998 when Ken Starr was investigating Podesta over his role in helping Bill Clinton intern/mistress Monica Lewinsky land a job at the United Nations. The two were described as best friends. FOX News confirms Fantastic lawyer. Kept me out of jail, Podesta wrote on Sept. 8, 2008 to Obama aide Cassandra Butts, according to emails hacked from Podestas Gmail account and posted by WikiLeaks. To call the Clinton circle incestuous would be an understatement, and on the whole, Americans are sick of it. Russia  The Party Scapegoat Former Democratic Party leader Howard Dean was so incensed about the FBI reopening the case, he accused the FBI director of being in league with Russia, Tweeting Ironically Comey put himself on the same side as Putin. Ironically Comey put himself on the same side as Putin.  Howard Dean @GovHowardDean October 29, 2016 Another veteran party operative and lifetime Clinton defender, James Carville , was so upset by the FBI announcement that he accused the KGB working with Republicans to hijack the election during his wild rant on MSNBC . I think this an outrage and I think the fact that the KGB is involved in this election is an outrage and I think the American people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for Comey. Thats what I think, said Carville. Maybe someone can remind Carville that there is no KGB , and that the Soviet Union actually dissolved in 1991. These are just a few scandals surrounding the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign, along with the many exposs revealed through Wikileaks, and the Podesta email batches. Those are actual scandals with real tangible evidence  unlike the Russians hacking the DNC and John Podesta and passing those to Wikileaks. Suffice to say, the Democratic Party machine has already demonstrated that it is prepared to say anything in order to deflect and divert attention away from the damning Wikileaks material, and also blame Donald Trump in the process. It should be obvious by now that in their desperation to push a highly comprised Hillary Clinton over the finish line on November 8th, the Washington establishment has concocted the story that Putin is trying to influence our electoral process in the US. Theyve tried to lay this at the feet of Donald Trump, who Obama and Clinton claim has some secret special relationship with Vladimir Putin. The liberal mainstream media have made a meal out of this talking point, and antiRussian war hawks on the Republican side love it too. For the White House and the Clinton campaign this seemed like the ultimate clean sweep  a perfect double entendre . The geopolitical strategy behind this move was twofold. First, this non event would be used to advance immediate calls for sanctions against Russia. Secondly, the US could continue to lean on Russia in the UN over Syria. Previously, 21WIRE reported how Washingtons State Dept and UN delegations, led by the dynamic trio of John Kerry , Samantha Power , and John Kirby , already lied when levelling charges against Russia for war crimes in Aleppo, and again while accusing Russia and Syria of conducting an airstrike on a UN Aid Convoy in Syria. As we have already shown  that raid was most likely a ground attack carried out of USbacked rebels Al Nusra Front, or Nour alDin alZenki. With so much at stake geopolitically, why would Washington lie about a potential World War III trigger event If they are prepared to lie about this, what else are they prepared to lie about The demonization of all things Russian has definitely accelerated since late 2013 when the US engineered a coup detat in Kiev, Ukraine. Ever since that its been a goto talking point for ginningup and new transaltlantic arms race, as with Republican war hawks  and a convenient scapegoat for any politician requiring misdirection, like Clinton and the Democrats. When the new year rang in 2015, the newly appointed head of the U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors, Andrew Lack, announced the new challenges facing Americas own staterun media arm that includes U.S. overseas propaganda assets including Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the Middle East Broadcasting Networks and Radio Free Asia. Lack said , We are facing a number of challenges from entities like Russia Today which is out there pushing a point of view, the Islamic State in the Middle East and groups like Boko Haram, He was forced to resign shortly after that. Whats clear is that when it comes to all things Russian, there is an established pattern of compulsive lying by this US Administration. The list is too long to chronicle here, although  Russianbacked Rebles Shootting Down MH17 , and  Assad Regime Sarin Attack in Damascus in 2013  certainly comes to mind. That said, its hard to imagine a lie as egregious and potentially destructive than one which accuses the Russia government, a world nuclear power and member of the UNSC, of Hacking Into the US Electoral Process. When you examine history however, what you will find is plenty of evidence documenting exactly how the US government and the CIA have altered and flipped 100 foreign elections throughout history, the attempted assassination of over 50 foreign leaders . Knowing all this, one might find it hard to take seriously Washingtons claims that Putin and Trump are trying manipulate the 2016 Election On Oct 9, 2016, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov laid it all on the table We have witnessed a fundamental change of circumstances when it comes to the aggressive Russophobia that now lies at the heart of U.S. policy towards Russia. Its not just a rhetorical Russophobia, but aggressive steps that really hurt our national interests and pose a threat to our security. Selfserving, career political operatives in Washington are playing a dangerous game. History will mark this as one of the biggest political follies of the ObamaClinton era. Knowing what we now know about the NSA and its ability to hack and grab any email or text message from anyone, anywhere  if Washington really wanted to know where the hacks came from, maybe they could start there. Far be it from anyone in Washington or the media to ever adopt that line of inquiry. Still, were waiting for the emergence of an adult in the room in Washington  before its too late.

"November 3, 2016 By Shawn Helton 1 Comment Shawn Helton 21st Century Wire The cozy relationship between Goldman Sachs and the Clintons has reached dizzying new heights in recent years, giving the Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton an immensely influential partner on Wall Street. As the public and most of the mainstream media is still processing the political bombshell concerning the newly reopened FBI probe into the Hillary Clinton s email server case  the global investment banking firm Goldman Sachs quietly endorsed the Democratic presidential candidate this past week. The financial ties that bind the Clintons and Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs are nothing new, but never before have the connections been so exposed. Lets take a trip down collusion lane to review some of the more questionable examples of their political and financial merger formed long ago MONEY CHANGERS Wall Streets Goldman Sachs are inextricably linked to the Clintons and The Clinton Foundation. Photo illustration 21WIRE The Clintons  Goldman Sachs While campaigning for his first term in the White House, former president Bill Clinton received an enormous amount of support from Washington insider lobbyists and investment banking firms on Wall Street. At the top of the pile sat Goldman Sachs In 1992, the LA Times reported that presidential nominee Bill Clinton, received the largest share of his financial supportat least 2.6 millionfrom lawyers and lobbyists, and that Clinton also received additional support from big securities firms such as Goldman, Sachs  Co. in New York and Stephens Inc. in his hometown of Little Rock, Ark. In fact, Goldman Sachs employees and their family members were responsible for the biggest contributions from a single firm 98,700. For decades the Clintons have remained close allies to the banking behemoth Goldman Sachs and in the process, a mutually beneficial relationship has taken hold, something that even the NY Times admits Over 20plus years, Goldman provided the Clintons with some of their most influential advisers, millions of dollars in campaign contributions and speaking fees, and financial support for the family foundations charitable programs. By now, there should be little doubt that the Clinton political machine is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Wall Street banking cartel. Their relationship was built over three decades. The real watershed moment came here BLANK CHECK Bill Clinton laughs with Wall Street elites after signing the Financial Services Modernization Act in 1999. Key to the Kingdom In one of the most significant financial rulings in the modern era, the Clinton presidency gave big banks like Goldman Sachs the skeleton key to the kingdom by deregulating the investment banking system almost entirely. The Clinton/Goldman Sachs/Wall Street partnership was fully forged after the removal of the GlassSteagall Act , which banking luminaries cynically named the  Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 officially titled the Gramm LeachBliley Act . The original GlassSteagall was a depressionage fourpart provision under the Bank Act of 1933 that strictly prohibited securities activities that could be harmful to investors  the same sort of rogue speculating and paper fiat fraud which triggered the Great Depression 19291941. In fact, the GrammLeachBliley Act which repealed GlassSteagall, opened the door for the shadow banking realm outside of regulatory oversight which led to a much higher trading risk, as banks became more interlinked. Simply put Clintons repeal of GlassSteagell removed the firewall between speculative investment banking and regular high street retail and consumer banking  which exposed everyone to toxic, subprime ponzi schemes and fake paper products being pushed around the globe by the banking elite  which ultimately causing the global economy to crash in 2008. All that can be laid at the feet of one William Jefferson Clinton. And Hillary still claims that, My husband did so well with the economy. Really In a crossposted article featured at Huffington Post , Nomi Prins underscored the complicit nature of Wall Street and Washington after the removal of tighter bank regulations under the Clinton administration during the 1990s To grasp the dangers that the Big Six banks JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley presently pose to the financial stability of our nation and the world, you need to understand their history in Washington, starting with the Clinton years of the 1990s. Alliances established then not exclusively with Democrats, since bankers are bipartisan by nature enabled these firms to become as politically powerful as they are today and to exert that power over an unprecedented amount of capital. Rest assured of one thing their past and present CEOs will prove as critical in backing a Hillary Clinton presidency as they were in enabling her husbands years in office. Prins herself was a former managing director at Goldman Sachs, senior managing director at Bear Stearns, as well as having worked as a senior strategist at the now defunct investment banking firm Lehman Brothers. Following the financial crash in 20072008, Prins blew the whistle on the banking world in a book entitled  It Takes a Pillage  Behind the Bonuses, Bailouts, and Backroom Deals from Washington to Wall Street. Prins has become an advocate for the reinstatement of the GlassSteagall Act since departing from the investment banking world. The media outlet Common Dreams described the merger between Citicorp and Travelers Group becoming Citigroup, which was dubbed the CitiTravelers Act on Capitol Hill. It was a conglomeration that went hand in hand with the Clinton administrations influence on banking deregulation marked by the repeal of GlassSteagall Then, in 1998, in an act of corporate civil disobedience, Citicorp and Travelers Group announced they were merging. Such a combination of banking and insurance companies was illegal under the Bank Holding Company Act , but was excused due to a loophole that provided a twoyear review period of proposed mergers. The merger was premised on the expectation that GlassSteagall would be repealed. Citigroups cochairs Sandy Weill and John Reed led a swarm of industry executives and lobbyists who trammeled the halls of Congress to make sure a deal was cut. At the time, it was the largest financial merger even though it was technically illegal , as stated by the former Bankers of America CEO Kenneth Guenther . In 1999 , after 12 attempts in 25 years, Congress passed the Financial Services Modernization Act , which led to the repeal of GlassSteagall. The repeal of GlassSteagall was pushed heavily by Citigroups coCEO Sanford Weill and lobbyist Roger Levy and according to a report by The Nation  They laid out more than 290 million for lobbying in 1998, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, and donated more than 150 million in the 199798 election cyclea figure sure to be topped in 19992000. How much of those contributions made their way to the Clinton family and what kind of impact did this have after they left the White House In 2005, Bill Clinton was paid over half a million for speaking at three private Goldman events. In 2013, after stepping down from her position as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton gave a total of three paid speeches at Goldman Sachs events to the tune of 675,000 dollars, in which one attendee said s he sounded more like a Goldman Sachs managing director, according to a quote obtained by Politico . Indeed, Clinton gave a glowing speech to the Goldman gang and in the process, as Wikileaks released in early October , the Democratic nominee believes in both a public and a private position on Wall Street reform and that it is an  oversimplification to suggest that investment banking led to the most recent financial crisis. That Clinton leak provided another window into the much protected alliance between finance and politics, but its only the tip of a much larger iceberg. In 2015, the Washington Post reported that Hillary Rodham Clinton and former president Bill Clinton earned in excess of 25 million for delivering 104 speeches since the beginning of 2014, a huge infusion to their net worth as she was readying for a presidential bid. ANOINTED Chelsea Clinton with Goldman Sachsbacked hedge funder Marc Mezvinsky. The Clinton family is chockfull of banking connections, as Chelsea Clinton joined the Avenue Capital Group, which according to reports is a 12 billion hedge fund whose founder has contributed to many Democratic Party campaigns. Chelsea is married to Marc Mezvinsky , a former investment banker for Goldman Sachs. Chelseas tenure at Avenue Capital Group was from 20062008 just prior to Hillary Clintons run for president in 2008. Since then Chelsea has risen to vice chairman inside the Clinton Foundation. Marc Mezvinsky was forced to close one of his hedge funds recently, Eaglevale Hellenic Opportunity , after had the fund lost most of its initial investor funds of 25 million  after blowing the money on secondhand junk Greek bank stocks and toxic government debt. The apple doesnt fall far from the tree As it turns out, Marc is the son of troubled former Congressman Ed Mezvinsky  another close friend of Team Clinton. Politico reports on one of Ed Mezvinskys financial controversies in 1999 In the waning days of Clintons presidency, federal prosecutors and the FBI were bearing down on former Rep. Ed Mezvinsky DIowa, who had fallen for a series of Ponzi schemes and pulled in nearly 10 million money from other investors to cover his losses.  Continuing, Politico outlined new information concerning a pardon request sent by from Ed Mezvinskys wife to then President Bill Clinton records released last week by the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock and obtained by POLITICO show Mezvinsky and his thenwife  exRep. Marjorie MargoliesMezvinsky DPa.  pleaded with the former president for a presidential pardon to head off the looming federal case. In 2016, the Daily Mail reported the following Chelsea Clintons husband and his partners have suffered a huge loss after trying to bet on the revival of the Greek economy, and are now being forced to shut down one of their hedge funds. Marc Mezvinsky, 38, and his partners, former Goldman Sachs colleagues Bennett Grau and Mark Mallon, raised 25million from investors to buy up bank stocks and debt from the struggling nation. That fund however has lost 90 percent of its value, investors with direct knowledge of the situation told The New York Times , and will now be closed. THE INSIDERS A groundbreaking ceremony at Goldman Sachs headquarters in Manhattan in 2005. Hillary Clinton is joined by Michael Bloomberg , Lloyd Blankfein current Goldman Sachs CEO, Former Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson. Image Source ilovemyfreedom  The NY Times further outlined the longheld Clinton/Goldman connection just two years before the 20072008 financial crisis The Clintons relationships with Wall Street deepened in the 2000s, when Mr. Clinton set up his foundation in Harlem and Mrs. Clinton was elected to the Senate from New York. That brought her in close touch with the big Wall Street firms, a source of jobs and tax revenue for New York  and a leading source of campaign funds for Mrs. Clinton. During her years in Congress, employees of Goldman donated in excess of 234,000 to Mrs. Clinton, more than those of any other company except Citigroup, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Along with other New York politicians, Mrs. Clinton worked to obtain federal tax breaks to resuscitate Lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and those breaks helped Goldman build its new, roughly 2 billion headquarters. When it broke ground in 2005, Mrs. Clinton and other New York officials were onsite. HOW TO MONETIZE INFLUENCE Lloyd Blankfein at a Clinton Global Initiative event with Hillary Clinton. Image Source sputniknews  The Wall Street Racket To understand who powers the Clinton Foundations billion dollar RICO influencepeddling slush fund, you need to understand how money is laundered between Wall Street and Washington DC. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Citigroup and many others were all ordered to pay millions for misleading investors after the 2008 crash, then in April of 2016, Goldman was ordered to settle a federal and state probe for 5 Billion dollars. CNBC reported the following Goldman Sachs will pay 5 billion to settle federal and state probes into the banks sale of mortgagebacked securities before the financial crisis, the Justice Department announced Monday. Authorities said Goldman misrepresented the quality of loans it securitized and then sold to investors ahead of the housing bubble and 2008 crisis. The settlement includes a 2.4 billion civil penalty, 1.8 billion in relief payouts to underwater homeowners and affected borrowers and 875 million to resolve various other claims. This resolution holds Goldman Sachs accountable for its serious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages, when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail, acting Associate Attorney General Stuart Delery said in a statement . In 2013, a Bloomberg article questioned how Goldman managed to survive and even thrive during the 20072008 economic crisis Whether Goldman could have gone the way of Lehman Brothers or Merrill Lynch remains the subject of much debate. Goldman maintains that it did not need, or want, the 10 billion bailout that Hank Paulson  former Goldman alum pushed on it and other firms in October 2008. But the fact remains that when the Federal Reserve allowed Goldman and Morgan Stanleybut not Lehman Brothersto become bank holding companies on Sept. 21, 2008, Goldman was able, three days later, to raise 10 billion in equity, 5 billion from the public and another 5 billion from investor Warren Buffett. That would probably not have happened without the Feds expedited decision and support. A week later, Morgan Stanley saved itself from bankruptcy when it negotiated a 9 billion equity investment from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. All told the Clinton friendly investment giant Goldman Sachs after making record profits became the fifth megabank ordered to pay billions to the Department of Justice after the financial crash of 20072008. In addition, the firm was ordered to pay 3 billion to the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2014  not including pending private lawsuits levied on the firm since the Great Recession. In a New York Review article Goldman Sachs was already under investigation for committing fraud at least a year before the economic crash in 20072008 Data gathered mostly from the Corporate Research Project , a public interest website, show that on thirteen occasions between 2009 and 2016, Goldman was penalized by US courts or government agencies for fraudulent or deceptive practices that were committed mostly between 2006 and 2009. CASHING OUT Bill Clinton with his top economic strategist Robert Rubin. Image Source St. Louis PostDispatch  Wall Street Selects Team Clinton The Clinton connection to Goldman Sachs emerged in the early 1990s as Robert Rubin , a former senior partner with Goldman with a 26year tenure with the firm, joined former President Clintons economic policy team, later becoming Secretary of the Treasury in 1995. Around that time, the Clinton presidency ushered in soaring tax hikes under the Rubinomics banner aka Clintonomics, the plan raised taxes on most Americans, specifically the middle class , in what was said to be the largest increase in American history at the time. According to Congressional record  Vol.146 part 2 , In 1995, the economy grew at a sickly 1.5  Clintons vetoes of spending cuts insured continued deficits well into the 21st Century. In a Multinational Monitor report entitled Wall Streets Best Investment Ten Deregulatory Steps to Financial Meltdown, by Robert Weissman and James Donahue , a clearer picture of the financial collusion spawned in the 1990s under the Clinton administration was revealed During the Clinton Administration, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who had run Goldman Sachs, enthusiastically promoted the legislation. In a 1995 testimony before the House Banking Committee, for example, Rubin argued that the banking industry is fundamentally different from what it was two decades ago, let alone in 1933.  U.S. banks generally engage in a broader range of securities activities abroad than is permitted domestically. Even domestically, the separation of investment banking and commercial banking envisioned by GlassSteagall has eroded significantly. With a pedigree that included Goldman Sachs, the Council on Foreign Relations CFR, The Brookings Institution and the Bilderberg Group , Robert Rubin emerged in 1999 as the vice chairman at Citigroup 19992009 after overseeing its merger as well as helping to craft the repeal of GlassSteagall while serving as Secretary of Treasury. Rubin made a fortune with Citigroup causing sharp criticism in media and from those within the financial sector following the 20072008 crash. Heres a passage from Bloomberg regarding Rubin in the aftermath of the banking collapse When it collapsed, due in part to bankfriendly policies that Rubin advocated, he made more than 100 million while others lost everything. You have to view people in a fair light, says Phil Angelides, cochair of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, who credits Rubin for much of the Clintonera prosperity. But on the other side of the ledger are key acts, such as the deregulation of derivatives, or stopping the Commodities Futures Trading Commission from regulating derivatives, that in the end weakened our financial system and exposed us to the risk of financial disaster. SWORN FBI director James Comey sworn in by former DOJ head Eric Holder. Image Source thewhitehousespin  Under the Microscope Over the summer 21WIRE observed some curious connections between the Clinton Foundation and FBI director James Comey , as well as his questionable handling of other cases related to the Clinton family. Heres the following passage to consider in light of the new information related to the Clinton investigation Many will also be unaware that before Comey was installed by the Obama Administration as FBI Director, he was on the board of Director at HSBC Bank  a bank implicated in international money laundering , including the laundering of billions on behalf of international drugs and narcotics trafficking cartels. Forbes also points out where Comey was also at the key chokepoint during the case involving dodgy auditor KPMG which followed on by the HSBC criminal case If Comey, and his boss Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez, had made a different decision about KPMG back in 2005, KPMG would not have been around to miss all the illegal acts HSBC and Standard Chartered SCBFF  were committing on its watch. Bloomberg reported in 2007 that back in June of 2005, Comey was the man thrust into the position of deciding whether KPMG would live or die for its criminal tax shelter violations. In 2015, the Guardian discussed the financial relationship between HSBC and the Clinton Foundation receiving a startling 81 million in donations from clients of the large bank The charitable foundation run by Hillary Clinton and her family has received as much as 81m from wealthy international donors who were clients of HSBCs controversial Swiss bank. Leaked files from HSBCs Swiss banking division reveal the identities of seven donors to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation with accounts in Geneva. A new update on the FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation was announced over the last 24 hours, in addition the recently reopened Clinton email probe from last week. It remains to be seen how indepth this new investigation will be. To call it collusion would be an understatement. When looking back at the financial affairs of the Clintons, Goldman Sachs and others on Wall Street  its clearer than ever that what we are looking at is a criminal syndicate.

"21st Century Wire says This should be the biggest revelation yet from WikiLeaks already epic email trove. Will the US media cover this story Last night, in an RT Exclusive interview conducted by awardwinning filmmaker John Pilger, WikiLeaks editor and founder Julian Assange described what he believes is the most significant email in the whole collection. WikiLeaks reveals an early 2014 email where the outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was urging John Podesta , then advisor to President Barack Obama, to bring pressure on Gulf states Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL Islamic State, IS, ISIS and other radical Sunni groups. This constitutes proof that the Clinton Foundation knowingly accepting millions of dollars in charitable donations from the same Gulf states which both Secretary Clinton and President Obama knew were funding ISIS, Al Nusra Front al Qaeda in Syria and known takfiri terrorist fighting organizations. In addition, the Clintons Foundation took money from a number of other gulf monarchies Infographic Conservative Post  This latest news validates what 21WIRE has been saying since the ISIS crisis began in June 2014. According to FOX News , FBI sources have said that indictments are likely for the Clinton Foundation investigation. One only wonders how this latest Assange revelation will factor into the wider investigation  as it goes right to the heart of the national security and foreign policy  two things which Clinton trades heavily on in her campaigning. Assange went on to explain the deep ramifications of this latest criminal allegation against Clinton and her family foundation All serious analysts know, and even the US government has agreed, that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIS and funding ISIS, but the dodge has always been that it is some rogue princes using their oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that it is the government of Saudi Arabia, and the government of Qatar that have been funding ISIS. During their 25minute interview filmed at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, Assange and Pilger discussed the obvious conflict of interest between Clinton as Secretary of State, the Clinton Foundation and Gulf monarchies who financed them. The following is an excerpt from the interview transcript John Pilger The Saudis, the Qataris, the Moroccans, the Bahrainis, particularly the first two, are giving all this money to the Clinton Foundation, while Hillary Clinton is secretary of state, and the State Department is approving massive arms sales, particularly Saudi Arabia. Julian Assange Under Hillary Clinton  and the Clinton emails reveal a significant discussion of it  the biggestever arms deal in the world was made with Saudi Arabia more than 80 billion. During her tenure, the total arms exports from the US doubled in dollar value. JP Of course, the consequence of that is that this notorious jihadist group, called ISIL or ISIS, is created largely with money from people who are giving money to the Clinton Foundation JA Yes.

"21st Century Wire says Yesterday, WikiLeaks editor and founder Julian Assange confirmed what 21WIRE already knew  that Hillary Clinton and the Obama White Houses claim of the US election process being hacked by the Russian government was a desperate work of fiction. Not content with that fish tale, Hillary Clinton took the narrative to an embarrassing new low if that was even possible with another, wilder madeup conspiracy story about the Russians. The following statement made by Hillary Clinton yesterday epitomizes the term  jumping the shark  Its time for Trump to answer serious questions about his ties to Russia. https//t.co/D8oSmyVAR4 pic.twitter.com/07dRyEmPjX  Hillary Clinton @HillaryClinton October 31, 2016 Apparently, Hillary Clintons campaign staff fed her a planted online news story by the Clinton campaign which ran on a questionable proDemocratic Party online news outlet. On Monday, the Slate ran the story by one of its alleged journalists named Franklin Foer , complete with a clickbait bloglike headline, Was a Trump Server Communicating With Russia Whatever legitimacy the Slate had before last night, just evaporated. John Roberts from Forbes explains, The bottom line is that Slate screwed up by publishing this in the first place, and by adding more kooky misinformation to an already addled election season. As for Foer, he says on Twitter a follow up piece is in the works. Roberts rightly points out that the only followup story for this lemon should start with the word RETRACTION. CYBER FEUD Assange believes Clinton has gone beyond the pale with her Russian conspiracy obsession. During his exclusive interview with awardwinning filmmaker John Pilger, when asked what he thought of Hillary Clintons shrill antics, Julian Assange said,  I actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person, because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick. The saddest thing about this and the other dishonest and destructive actions of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party  is that no one in the party seems to see anything wrong with this level of deceit and dishonesty. Like Hillary Clinton in her sociopathic path to power, the party rank and file are acting like a cult coven following their high priestess. Still, Clinton surrogates in the media are trying to equate Clinton simultaneously scapegoating and baiting another nuclear superpower  with a decadeold misogynist hot mic audio excerpt of Donald Trump in a TMZstyle tabloid sting. That pretty much sums up Democratic Party strategy for this election season. Assange was right. Clinton, the Democratic Party and their surrogate, are eating themselves. Such are the spoils of power in Washington that men and women will do and say anything to have it.

"21st Century Wire says Over the past months, Hillary Clinton, the Obama White House and the mainstream media have been promoting the conspiracy theory that  Russia is Hacking the US Election  blaming Moscow for the WikiLeaks emails, the DNC Leaks and for allegedly hacking US voting systems. Despite the grand accusations, no evidence or proof has been offered by the US government. It goes without saying how damaging the Democratic Partys crazed witch hunt has been to USRussian relations, where Clinton has led the antiRussian crusade, and demonizing president Vladimir Putin at every opportunity. Todays stunning presidential victory by Donald Trump means that all eyes are now on Putin to see how Moscow and Washington will be interfacing going forward. With such sensitive geopolitical issues like Syria and the Ukraine currently in play, what happens between the two leaders over the coming months could set the tone going forward In a message to Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed confidence that the dialogue between Moscow and Washington, in keeping with each others views, meets the interests of both Russia and the US. Putin also expressed hope over the joint efforts on bringing RussianAmerican relations out of their current crisis. The Russian leader noted in the message that he hopes to address some burning issues that are currently on the international agenda, and search for effective responses to the challenges of the global security, RIA Novosti reported. On top of it, Putin has expressed confidence that building a constructive dialogue between Moscow and Washington, based on principles of equality, mutual respect and each others positions, meets the interests of the peoples of our countries and of the entire international community. According to many observers, USRussia relations are now at their lowest point since the Cold War. Putin has repeatedly noted that the worsening of Russias relations with the US was not our choice, however. For things to improve between Moscow and Washington, the US should first and foremost start acting like an equal partner and respect Russias interests rather than try to dictate terms, Putin said last month. We are concerned with the deterioration of RussianAmerican relations, but that was not our choice, we never wanted that. On the contrary, we want to have friendly relations with the US, a great country and a leading economy, Putin said at an economic forum in Moscow READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT 21st Century Wire 2016 Files SUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE  BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV ",conspiracy

"21st Century Wire says One of the great myths being spun by the establishment media was that Donald Trump had no support from women, latinos and blacks in the US. As it turned out, this was a lie propagated in a failed attempt to margnalize Republican voters and give a false impression of a liberal Democratic mandate in America. In the end Trump gathered 29 of Latinos, 9 of African Americans and 49 of college educated white women. For months, mainstream media pundits and polls insisted that all of these demographics were exclusively for Hillary Clinton.

"November 11, 2016 By Shawn Helton Leave a Comment Shawn Helton 21st Century Wire AntiTrump street protests linked to the Soros funded organization MoveOn.org have cascaded across the nation for the third day following the 2016 presidential election result. Mainstream media outlets like CNN and MSNBC have given the protests aroundtheclock media coverage, drowning out all other news stories, including a successful transition meeting between the President Elect and President Barack Obama. OUTSIDER VS. INSIDER Manufactured social unrest incited after announcement of Trump presidency. Photo Illustration 21WIREs Shawn Helton The Free Thought Project weighed in on the new developments concerning a series of centrally coordinated antiTrump protests organized in part by by the George Soros NGO MoveOn Washington, D.C.  Billionaire globalist financier George Soros MoveOn.org has been revealed to be a driving force behind the organizing of nationwide protests against the election of Donald Trump  exposing the protests to largely be an organized, topdown operation  and not an organic movement of concerned Americans taking to the streets as reported by the mainstream media. Wednesday saw protests in the streets of at least 10 major U.S. cities. Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston, Washington, D.C., Portland, Ore., St. Paul, Minn., Seattle , and several other cities saw protests, according to USA Today. In light of the protests and rioting that have transpired since the election of Trump, a closer analysis of the dynamic at play is warranted to gauge whether its an organic grassroots movement, or something much more organized, sophisticated and potentially dangerous. Soros affiliated organization MoveOn.org released the following press release yesterday afternoon Americans to Come Together in Hundreds Peaceful Gatherings of Solidarity, Resistance, and Resolve Following Election Results Hundreds of Americans, dozens of organizations to gather peacefully outside the White House and in cities and towns nationwide to take a continued stand against misogyny, racism, Islamophobia, and xenophobia. Tonight, thousands of Americans will come together at hundreds of peaceful gatherings in cities and towns across the nation, including outside the White House, following the results of Tuesdays presidential election. The gatherings  organized by MoveOn.org and allies  will affirm a continued rejection of Donald Trumps bigotry, xenophobia, Islamophobia, and misogyny and demonstrate our resolve to fight together for the America we still believe is possible. Within two hours of the calltoaction, MoveOn members had created more than 200 gatherings nationwide, with the number continuing to grow on Wednesday afternoon. Soros AgitProp Empire Last year during the ongoing European migrant crisis, startling claims were levied by Hungarian PM Victor Orban left photo, concerning the role played by Soros. PM Orban contended that the founder and chair of Open Society Foundations Open Society Institute, was entrenched in a  circle of activists, that inadvertently become part of this international humansmuggling network. The stunning declaration by Orban recalled the misguided machinations of The Occupy Movement  aka OWS in 2011, as well as the Soros funded protests in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014, along with other Black Lives Matter protests this past year  all of which were uniquely designed to push naive participants along with paid provocateurs into violent action and social unrest. Back in January, MoveOn publicly endorsed the Bernie Sanders campaign in what appeared to be a call to action for BLM associated groups seen backing Sanders. Its worth mentioning, that MoveOn also supported the Obama campaign in 2008 and according to the website, Sanders was the only other candidate to reach the threshold for an endorsement. As we said back in March, professional political agitator flash mobs, had been mobilized at future Trump campaign events, making it very difficult to run a normal campaign  as activists attempted to take away Trumps strength in numbers at his rallies. This was confirmed at events in both Ohio, and at a Trump primary campaign event the University of Illinois Chicago earlier this year, where hundreds of BLM activists and Sanders supporters, triggered voilent clashes inside the venue and even stormed the stage , shortly after Trump started speaking, then again at Reno he was birddogged just prior to his election forcing secret service to escort Trump away. In a Politico article in early 2016 entitled  Major donors consider funding Black Lives Matter , we gained deeper insight into the political funding for BLM and the Soros linked Democratic Alliance Major donors are usually not as radical or confrontational as activists most in touch with the pain of oppression, said Steve Phillips, a Democracy Alliance member and significant contributor to Democratic candidates and causes. He donated to a St. Louis nonprofit group called the Organization for Black Struggle that helped organize 2014 Black Lives Matterrelated protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the police killing of a black teenager named Michael Brown. And Phillips and his wife, Democracy Alliance board member Susan Sandler, are in discussions about funding other groups involved in the movement. It worth noting how Soros, a long time contributor to Hillary Clinton, donated 2 million in PAC money in 2015 and January of 2016, Soros reportedly gave 8 million to boost Clintons campaign . Soros also recently funded 15 million to Latino groups looking to stop Trumps rise towards a potential GOP nomination and beyond. Look for these political engineers to pit choreographed conservative and liberal groups against each other across the country  as all of these hostile uprisings are designer engineered by party linked alliances. SOCIAL ENGINEERING Political memes and staged political flash mobs have been sparked by media, NGOs and social media. Image Source abc news  During the last month, it was revealed how investigative nonprofit Project Veritas found evidence that the DNC paid participants to incite violence at Trump rallies during the course of the 2016 election. If those reports are accurate  reports which have gone unchallenged so far  this would be in violation of both election bylaws and also US criminal law. PAID PROTEST Social justice warriors incite antiTrump violence across the US. Image Source youtube  USA Color Revolutions Both the purpose of these types of agitation activities seems to be to first cause a public disruption, and also to foment are a form of modern class warfare. These political protests are designed in such a way as to disguise its true intentions. Ultimately, a radical globalist and cultural marxist progressive agenda is at play  eroding the legitimacy of a democratically elected government through a series of artificial color upheavals, and where possible  weakening a countrys national sovereignty through forced dependency on multilateral globalist institutions like the UN or IMF, while presenting shock and awe imagery in order to manipulate the publics political perspective. This is how the US and its CIA conduct their destablization color revolution campaigns overseas , and now astute observers will be able to see these exact same methods being deployed here inside the US. Overseas, Washington tends to use the same cast of NGO fronts to buildup proUS political opposition groups, as well as plan and generate civil unrest. They include the Albert Einstein Institute AEI, National Endowment for Democracy NED, International Republican Institute IRI, National Democratic Institute NDI, Freedom House and later the International Center for NonViolent Conflict ICNC, and the US Agency for International Development USAID, the financial and contractor arm of the Department of State. Inside the US, deep state actors in Washington generally work through Democratic Party affiliated organizations like MoveOn.org , as well as through labor union organizations like AFLCIO , and UNITE HERE . These, along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this weeks protests. It still remains to be seen if Trumps stated dynamic political vision for America can unite an embattled nation by restoring international relations throughout the world, in addition to helping economic woes at home, or will it simply push the country further into authoritarianism. This remains to be seen. Certainly, judging by President Obama and Hillary Clintons total silence over their own partys role in fomenting this weeks unrest  one can only conclude that both party leaders approve of the protests and riots. The political motivation is undeniable  to help delegitimize a new Trump presidency. But one thing is for sure  theres no doubt now that a systematic design is in place to unsettle the 45th president and the public should question why. Legal Action Against Soros Groups In a recent report featured at RT news we learn that George Soros and BLM activists will be sued for the deaths of slain police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge The father of the Dallas police officer who was killed by a lone gunman during a Black Lives Matter protest is suing the organizations activists and George Soros for 550 million . In a separate suit a Baton Rouge police officer is suing for injuries sustained during a BLM protest. The father of Patrick Zamarripa filed a lawsuit against Black Lives Matter and other groups for allegedly inciting a war on police that led to the death of his son. The lawsuit filed in US District Court in Dallas on Monday seeks 550 million in damages. While Defendant Black Lives Matter claims to combat antiblack racism, the lawsuit said, according to the Fort Worth Star Telegram, the movement has in fact incited and committed further violence, severe bodily injury and death against police officers of all races and ethnicities, Jews, and Caucasians. Defendant Black Lives Matter is in fact a violent and revolutionary criminal gang. The misguided machinations behind the antiTrump protests have dominated any peaceful transition into power for the presidentelect.

Now it looks like Soros may be setting his sights on sabotaging the forthcoming Trump presidency. We do know, thanks to Wikileaks, that George Soros was a huge supporter of Hillary Clinton, as Hillary Clinton was always looking out of George Soros best interests.

"November 15, 2016 By 21wire Leave a Comment J.R. Smith 21st Century Wire The election campaign might be over, but the mainstream medias campaign against President Elect Donald Trump is in full swing. Between all of the fake polling, intentionally proClinton partisan coverage, and mainstream media collusion with the Democratic National Party and the Clinton Campaign exposed through WikiLeaks Podesta email dump  nearly the entire US mainstream media is now in full damagelimitation mode desperately trying to preserve any crumb of credibility and perceived authority they might have left. Its now become clear that the media is guilty on multiple fronts, as more proof has emerged of how they are helping to stoke violence, while promoting unfounded fears  and all the while pushing fictional hate crime hoaxes. CBS News flagship investigative program 60 Minutes conducted a recorded interview with Trump on Friday in which he made a direct plea on camera to any possible supporters to Stop it, in reference to anyone that may have written racist slogans or abusive language in public, or at schools. In light of the numerous pockets of protests and outbreaks of partisan violence which have racked America since the election results were announced last week, it would have been in the public interest to release this powerful appeal by Trump, but instead mainstream CBS buried it for 3 days until 60 Minutes was scheduled to air later on Sunday evening nationwide. If CBS had any credibility remaining, this certainly will have finished it off. When told about alleged reports of a Trump supporter who were said to have been harassing Latinos and Muslims following his presidential win, Trump told interviewer Leslie Stahl , I am so saddened to hear that. He then added, And I say, Stop it. If it helps, I will say this  and I will say right to the cameras Stop it. One big thing in this incident that many mainstream media observers did not pick up is that at no time did Stahl give any specifics on these alleged abuses by Trump supporters against Muslims and Latinos, and even though its obvious that Trump was not responsible for directing any alleged abuses  Stahl still demanded an apology on their behalf  without offering any evidence to support her claim. This was driveby media at its worst. In fact, not one of these said accusations of abuse have been properly investigated by the media, and some may end up actually being mediagenerated rumors, or even hoaxes. Now, its perfectly understandable that Trumps victory over the establishments heavily inflated candidate Hillary Clinton has left many Democrats, especially millennial collegeaged students upset, angry and feeling more than a little delicate due to their bruised collective egos they are not upset that Trump won, as much as they are upset that they lost. The real problem exists far beyond the learned immaturity of Americas politically correctobsessed young adults. The real danger is that Democratic Party gutter operatives and their liberal media cohorts are actually staging, and fabricating hate crime incidents in order to propagate the idea that the President Elect and his supporters are somehow causing many minorities fearful about the future. In reality, much of this hype is being generated through these same liberal media outlets. In fact, one Muslim female from Louisiana has since been forced to apologize for inventing her alleged hate crime incident  one designed to discredit Trump, and to help stoke more nationwide protests. Buzzfeed reported, via Religion of Peace  A woman who claimed she was attacked and robbed by two men near the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, including one wearing a Donald Trump hat, made up the story, police said in a statement. The woman had alleged the men yelled obscenities at her and took away her wallet and hijab, a scarf sometimes worn by Muslim women, The Advertiser reported. Lafayette Police officials said in a statement the incident is no longer under investigation, the paper reported. During the course of the investigation, the female complainant admitted that she fabricated the story about her physical attack as well as the removal of her hijab and wallet by two white males, the statement reportedly read. NOTE This story made national headlines and was not questioned or challenged by the hordes of selfdescribed journalists who populate the news and editorial newsrooms of Americas corrupt liberal mainstream media. Thats right  this was just another hoax Violent DemocraticAffiliated Street Gangs What Leslie Stahl and the rest of the gatekeepers at CBS and 60 Minutes have obscured is the fact since Tuesdays election, nearly all of the socalled violent hate crimes have been carried out against Trump supporters  by street gangs who are most clearly Democrat Party supporters. Here are just a few examples @michellemalkin Even high school kids are not spared. Student Trump supporter attacked at Woodside High School https//t.co/e7tVvDJ6O8  Mama Angel @Mommysaurus75 November 11, 2016 Watch this clip taken from the radical leftist Portland protests this weekend, where Democratic Party supports attack a single woman in her car because they believed that she was a Trump supporter. These violent incidents reveal the flavor of anarchy which the Democratic Party and the sitting President of the United States, Barack Obama  are condoning through their deaf silence over the multiple reports of street violence unleashed with the help of the Democratic Partys online community organizer network MoveOn.org  a digital platform partly funded by leading Clinton donor and billionaire George Soros . Watch this stunning clip . Here is a video of clip of a white male in Chicago, 49 yr old David Wilcox, who was driving and scraped another vehicle. When the two parties stopped at the intersection to exchange insurance information, Wilcox was greeted by a gang of AfricanAmericans, presumably Democratic Party supporters, who began pointing and shouting, You voted for Donald Trump before beating and robbing the man in the middle of the street. Wilcox was then dragged hundreds of yards as he tried to keep the gang from stealing his car in broad daylight. He was treated for multiple wounds at a local hospital. From reports we learned that at no time before the attack took place did Wilcox display any support for Donald Trump. It appears as if they attacked him because he was white. So could one call this a case of black on white racism Regardless, its political intimidation done on the street  which could also be defined as pure political fascism. In this instance, the violence was partisan, and carried out by what could be classed as unofficial Democrat foot soldiers  enforcing a type of radical political regime on the streets of America. Watch this disturbing video . Agitator and Chief Where is Obama These incidents have been mostly blacked out by a national US media who are obviously still working to discredit the Trump Presidency. Amidst all this violence, however, where is the current President Obama, or the Democratic Partys losing candidate Hillary Clinton  to help calm street thugs and violent progressives Its almost as if Obama and Clinton are enjoying the unrest. Most certainly though, Obama, Clinton and the Democratic Party are hoping to use this weeks mediagenerated liberal angst as future political leverage. What used to be regarded as a reputable investigative news program, 60 minutes, has gradually become a joke. It seems disinterested in covering anything of genuine interest, opting instead for running bland People Magazine and Time Magazinestyle safe segments. Judging by its plummeting ratings, and its predictable cast of job for life governmentapproved media gatekeepercumcommentators like Anderson Cooper and Lesley Stahl, there is little hope for this institution. You might even say its irredeemable . One of the corporate mainstreams worst offenders during the election was CNN host Brian Stelter photo, left, whose own show is ironically titled Reliable Sources. Stelter is meant to be CNNs media watchdog person, laughably given the lofty title as senior media analyst. After leading CNNs own exposed efforts to obscure and derail Trumps Presidential run, while working to cover for a hugely unpopular even among Democrats Hillary Clinton candidacy, Stelter has now taken it upon himself to revamp his networks horrible reputation as an establishment gatekeeper and manipulator of US elections. But its too late. The damage has already been done, and CNN will not regain the hanging facade of credibility it once struggled to retain. They are a dirty media outlet, and now everyone knows it. Now CBS News has been exposed in public view, but their crime is even worse than CNNs which was just dirty politics in comparison. CBS News took it upon itself to compromise public safety, and put lives at risk  all for its own selfish institutional political position. Twenty years ago, this might have been considered shameful, but in todays toxic liberal media establishment ruled by an unhealthy feeling of superiority over the unwashed masses  they are all way past shameless at this stage. None of them can be trusted anymore  only tolerated, in the hope that they might actually report some useful news in the coming years. More on the CBS 60 Minutes scandal from The Hill COSMETIC CBSs Stahl represents the shallow, bland irrelevance of the mainstream gatekeeping media. Joe Concha The Hill CBS News is under fire for holding a videotaped clip from a Friday interview with Presidentelect Donald Trump urging supporters not to attack minorities until a 60 Minutes broadcast on Sunday night. I am very surprised to hear that. I hate to hear it, Trump told interviewer Lesley Stahl when told of some attacks on minorities that have reportedly occurred since his election victory Tuesday. I am so sorry to hear it, and I say stop it, Trump said before looking directly into the camera. And I say right to the camera, stop it. 60 Minutes did release quotes from the Friday interview in advance, but only a statement by Trump on the Affordable Care Act. We chose to release a quote on the issue that affects the most Americans  that was his statement on Obamacare, a spokesperson for CBS told CNN Monday. Kai Ryssdal, host of Marketplace, called that reasoning completely underwhelming. CBSs underwhelming answer We chose to release a quote on the issue that affects the most Americans  that was his statement on Obamacare  Brian Stelter @brianstelter November 14, 2016 Protests have grown in the wake of Trumps victory in major cities across the country.

"November 21, 2016 By 21wire Leave a Comment William McGurn Wall Street Journal Lets get this straight. Calling Hillary Clinton a bigot has reporters asking every Republican in sight if Donald Trump has gone too far. But the Clinton campaign releases a video saying Mr. Trump is the candidate of the Ku Klux Klan, and its all okeydokey Then again, Mr. Trump has already been likened to Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin. Small wonder theres a collective hohum when Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine says Mr. Trump is peddling KKK values. This is what Democrats do. It didnt start with Mr. Trump, either. For years Democrats have portrayed the GOP as one giant hate group. Each presidential election, the drill goes like this After Republicans nominate someone, he immediately finds himself having to prove hes not a hater  of AfricanAmericans, of women, of gays, etc. This year Democrats added a twist. Mr. Trump, they claim, represents a break with all those decent and lovable Republicans such as Mitt Romney , John McCain and George W. Bush . Of course, this isnt what they were saying back when these men were running for president.  In 2000, for example, an NAACP ad recreated the gruesome murder of James Byrd to imply that thenGov. Bush was sympathetic to lynching black men. Over footage of a chain being dragged by a pickup truck, Mr. Byrds daughter says, So when Gov. George W. Bush refused to support hatecrimes legislation, it was like my father was killed all over again.  When John McCain ran in 2008, Barack Obama warned that Republicans would scare people by saying, You know, he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills. The McCain campaign fired back, accusing Mr. Obama of playing the race card from the bottom of the deck. Funny thing All those reporters always hearing dog whistles from Republicans somehow didnt hear this one.  In 2012, when Mitt Romney went to the NAACP and told them facetoface about his opposition to ObamaCare, the stories were all about how he was really just trolling for the racist vote. Vice President Joe Biden put it more explicitly, telling a largely AfricanAmerican audience that if Mr. Romney were to win, hed put yall back in chains. The only difference today is that Republicans now have a nominee giving as good as he gets",conspiracy
"November 23, 2016 By 21wire Leave a Comment The person who received the most votes free from interference or tampering needs to be in the White House. It may well be Donald J. Trump, but further due diligence is required to ensure that American democracy is not threatened. 21st Century Wire says Although the election was called on Nov 8th, the Democratic Partys ongoing campaign to delegitimize the new incoming President is still ongoing. For those of us with long enough memories, the Democratic Party, their media operatives and the Clinton Campaign were claiming that Trump and the GOP would be engaged in this very same behavior after Hillary Clinton won the Presidency as expected. Notice how the shoe is now on the other foot. Its interesting reading past stories by news sources linked to the Clinton Campaign and John Podesta as Politico has, who ran a feature on Aug 16th entitled, Why the GOP Will Never Accept President Hillary Clinton which lays out the case of Hillarys lock on the White House and how the evil Republicans will not accept her eventual election victory. Will Donald Trump respect the peaceful transition of power howled CNNs Wolf Blitzer in the runup to the election. The question now is will the Democrats respect the result, and simply Move On, as they say Of course, we now know that journalists like Wolf at CNN were getting their talking points directly the Clinton Campaign . As it turns out, the only thing illegitimate about the 2016 Election was the mainstream corporate media. More form the Guardian The Guardian A growing number of academics and activists are calling for US authorities to fully audit or recount the 2016 presidential election vote in key battleground states, in case the results could have been skewed by foreign hackers. The loose coalition, which is urging Hillary Clintons campaign to join its fight, is preparing to deliver a report detailing its concerns to congressional committee chairs and federal authorities early next week, according to two people involved. The document, which is currently 18 pages long, focuses on concerns about the results in the states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Im interested in verifying the vote, said Dr Barbara Simons, an adviser to the US election assistance commission and expert on electronic voting. We need to have postelection ballot audits. Simons is understood to have contributed analysis to the effort but declined to characterise the precise nature of her involvement. A second group of analysts, led by the National Voting Rights Institute founder John Bonifaz and Professor Alex Halderman, the director of the University of Michigans center for computer security and society, is also taking part in the push for a review, and has been in contact with Simons. In a blogpost early on Wednesday, Halderman said paper ballots and voting equipment should be examined in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, warning that deadlines were rapidly approaching. Unfortunately, nobody is ever going to examine that evidence unless candidates in those states act now, in the next several days, to petition for recounts, he said. The developments follow Clintons surprise defeat to Donald Trump in the 8 November vote, and come after US intelligence authorities released public assessments that Russian hackers were behind intrusions into regional electoral computer systems and the theft of emails from Democratic officials before the election READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",conspiracy
"While Richard Spencers halfjoke of hailing Donald Trump with R oman salute rose a lot of dust, some remarks in his NPI speech point into rather sinister direction. A posthuman one. transcript with references and additional a/v material Undoubtedly, there was a sigh of relief throughout the world when Hillary Clinton lost Presidential elections to Donald Trump. If for nothing else, then for the sake of quiet joy of watching adolescent commissars melt in tears because racism, homophobia, xenophobia and whateverphobia it was a joy, and a relief, because it showed monolithic control system of moral nominalism , dubbed political correctness, to be a paper tiger. However, party is over and dialectics is back with the vengeance. As SJW s are, hopefully, moving out from the spotlight of posthistorical stage, the new contender asserts his right to fashion the reality of our day and age into his own image. If we are to judge the day by the first gleam of dawn, this image will be just as ugly  and just as unreal  as hermaphrodite ideal of politically correct  shitlib . In the words of more or less universally acclaimed leader of the alternative right movement, Richard Spencer, in the future we are to deal with the leadership of children of the sun. This is an interesting, and to my mind quite worrisome, statement of intent  a manifestation of will, as Spencer would doubtless rectify me  pointing out in many directions while seemingly focusing on the eternal  and quite unidirectional  circular movement of the pagan deity, revered by all selfrespecting bermenschen  from Nietzsche to postmodern occultists. However, theres a deeper astrotheological metaphor at work here. The pure eye that can gaze upon overabundance of joy without envy Nietzsche in its virtual, postmodern, installment is not to be strictly represented by Swastika  as Spencer apparently assumes, but by other, only seemingly ancient, symbol taken in fact from the world of tabletop and PC gaming and turned into ideological brand by Russian philosopher Alexander Dugin or his minions an individual widely promoted by core members of alt right movement. The symbol in question is an eight pointed star signifying the movement, not of sun, but of presumably primordial origin of everything Chaos. In the lines to follow, well provide some preliminary analysis of the emerging situation the channeling of chaos principle  and adjacent chaos logic  through loosely knit alt right movement, taking as a starting point some statements from Spencers speech held at NPI Conference in Washington D.C. on November 21 st . Triumph of the will or hipster Babylon working In introduction to his triumphal encomium to the ideological victory of alt right, embodied in the election of Donald Trump, Spencer makes one interesting remark But even though we always took Trump seriously, there was still a moment of unreality  or perhaps too painfully intense reality  when the state of Pennsylvania was called for Donald Trump, the moment when we knew Kek had smiled upon us, that meme magic was real. And though these terms are used halfjokingly, they represent something truly importantthe victory of will . We willed Donald Trump into office, made this dream into reality.  It is all delivered in a manner of an injoke, not to be taken too seriously. Moreover, to the uninitiated into mysteries of this Internet movement it is probably unclear who is Kek and what exactly is meme magic. Well start our explanation with lesser weirdness. Meme is an expression denoting inexistent existent, coined apparently by Richard Dawkins to explain how human thoughts fit in his evolutionary theology memes are thoughts expressed in image and/or phrase which, by circulation in public, acquire the life and subsistence of their own and are able to infect the consciousness with their messages, like viruses. Meme is inexistent because theres no such thing as thoughts having a biologically based selfsubsistence and ability to procreate like viruses. Images and/or phrases are not living beings save by bad analogy that omits to tell us on what exactly it is based what is that one principle making memes and viruses congenial. Yet they, quite paradoxically, exist because analogy apparently works . However no one seems to pose the question, why it works. Well, it works because it is magical. Chaos Magick Here we have an example of magical thinking in the postmodern  in fact posthumanist  vein, resting on assumption that what has not evolved in nature can  and should  be created in analogy to imagined process of evolution. If artificial construct is in line with principle of evolution it is real or, to be more precise, it is in accordance with imaginary nature of this principle it is imagined into existence . Therefore meme magick works only insofar it relies upon artificial, preferably technological medium for sustenance and on assumption that its recipients identify themselves with their artificial, preferably online identities that can indeed be imbibed with memes as they are in themselves artificial and arbitrary constructs. The goal of practitioner of such magic  a far cry from what was traditionally considered to be magic  is to change the world according to his will. This is, more or less, what is known from the Seventies of the last century as chaos magick , a postmodern imitation of ancient practice of acting in subhuman and subnatural domain of the world, in the past mostly confined to people born with dubious talent to practice it. The peculiarity of chaos magick is, on the one hand, that it is entirely syncretic, i.e. that it uses everything that its practitioner can imbibe with intended, subjective, meaning, and that it relies on virtual, i.e. artificial world of mass culture, now embodied above all in Internet. The idea behind it all is that nothing is true and everything is possible . There are many interesting implications to this. The first is that everything is interrelated, i.e. that everything is connected with everything else. So any which way you take, youll get where you want to get if you will it hard enough. The second is that theres no hierarchy of higher and lower  theres only an infinite surface dissolving into ever more complex elements, dissolving in turn into nothingness, if concentrated upon. As theres nothing higher, theres nothing to be revered and everything can  and indeed should  be an object of ironical laughter. And, most importantly, this is the world of dreams, ruled by what is usually called dream logic but in actual fact chaos logic or unlogic . In this sense, Richard Spencer quite accurately proclaimed Trumps victory an accomplishment of meme or chaos magick. Trump is willed into office by Internet memes binding the will of alt right adherents and turning their dream into reality  virtual reality, one may add, yet reality nonetheless. The fact that Trump was elected for a plethora of motives  from the appeal of his politics, to public takedown of Hillary Clinton by Wikileaks  is immaterial, because in the world of chaos every subjective reality tunnel, or interpretation of the world, is as real as any other. In this sense we can observe new God Emperor of USA as a magical creation of Internet, by the Internet and for the Internet  today still the Internet of interconnected computer nodes, but soon probably the Internet of things. If one is to push Spencers remark to its logical extreme, we can assert that illustrious Donald is the worlds first president of posthuman race an embodiment of ultra progressive dream invoked to reality by professed ultra antiprogressive group. So that was lesser weirdness. Let us proceed now to high weirdness. We owe the reader an answer to a question who the hell is Kek Well, the reason why Spencer mentions him is again a magickal halfjoke Kek is interpreted to be an ancient Egyptian deity by a number of Internet observers and identified with alt right memetic avatar  Pepe the frog. While I habitually suspend judgment on all things Egyptian, because ancient Egyptian culture is a slippery ground even for experts, I consider this interpretation, upon closer inspection, to be quite valid in the virtual light of chaos logic. Namely, Pepe, the cartoon character, conceived in 2005. by cartoonist Matt Furie, emerged as a meme from the depths of Internet forums, more precisely 4chan subforum /pol/, devoted to political discussions with no holds barred, which was, in view of some observers, a breeding ground for many alt right aficionados a place of absolute freedom, therefore absolute chaos. The expression kek was also appropriated from the forums and stems from the injoke among the players of World of Warcraft , replacing the standard Internet abbreviation LOL laughing out loud. Someone eventually noticed that Kek is in fact the name of frogheaded Egyptian deity, signifying Chaos and darkness, and Pepe was rebranded as Kek the deity  ironic one, no doubt, half joking one, as surprisingly many alt righters like to put it, but deity nonetheless. It is important to point out that in view of the most esoteric Kekists, that is half grinning faithful of Kek/Pepe, the association was originally entirely haphazard and accidental, yet it developed into an ever growing system of synchronicities  causally unrelated meaningful relations among events. So it came to pass that Kek sounds very similar to cuckoriginally cuckservative, a term denoting old fashioned conservative who was still not red pilled another meme taken from pop culture, shared by both alt right and conspiracy theorists by alt right or, should we assume Kek himself furthermore, Hillary Clinton addressed Pepe as nothing less than public enemy, identifying presumably the whole alt right movement with cartoon character. Then it happened that after this act Hillary fainted in front of the cameras, and that was immediately interpreted as an action of Kek. A good rundown of Kek/Pepe/Trump identification However, it all began with people noticing the numerical synchronicities in the random series of numbers in posts on /pol/ subforum One last thing you need to understand about imageboard culture dubs. Every post on 4chan and similar venues comes with an 8digit numerical stamp. This number represents that posts entry position in the entire posting lineage of the imageboard. With the amount of traffic these sites get, the last couple digits of this number are essentially a random roll. When a poster gets repeated digits, its called dubs, trips, quads, and so on. Since a poster cant know their post number until after theyve submitted the post, its common for people to bet the contents of their message on the occurrence of repeating digits  When that endeavor proves a successful, a GET has been made and the stroke of luck is celebrated. Out of this practice, a strange phenomenon began to take place on /pol/ discussion threads associated with Trump displayed noticeably frequent GETs. It wasnt long before all of these seemingly random elements discussed so far became irreparably tied together within imageboard culture Pepe the Frog now /pol/s unofficial mascot Donald Trump /pol/s overwhelming candidate of choice Repeating digit post numbers GETS KEK used as an expression of delight, particular in response to Trumps trolling of the establishment, as well as in reaction to unlikely GETs in general and a god was born.  source  Synchronicities related to emergence of Kek the God and his merging with Trump in the bowels of Internet forums early on in the presidential campaign, are so numerous and, frankly, mind boggling that we cannot list them here, for the sake of brevity. For our purpose it is sufficient to point out that for many alt right aficionados, including core leadership, Kek is the God and Trump is his prophet, all declared with smug grin and ironical stance, yet with all the necessary power of conviction. Namely, chaos magick relies on laughter, or irreverence of its own principles because it is essentially unprincipled. Fairly in accordance with its postmodern nature it seeks to deconstruct any kind of order to enable its practitioner to impose his own will and change the world  as Spencer would put it make his dreams a reality. I would go further and add make all reality a dream  because, chaos magick and alt right are nothing more but novel forms in the development of virtual, i.e. posthuman , world. The idea of adherence and reattachment to tradition that the alt right movement professes is nothing more but simulacrum appealing to people tired of liberal nihilism  in its essence, however, it is a complete opposite a disintegration of all substantial traditional principles  above all an idea of preexistent hierarchy of Being  into nothingness of primordial Chaos. Posthuman traditionalism I already developed this insight regarding the subversive work of Alexander Dugin, who is probably the most consequent subverter of Tradition with recognizable public persona acting in our age, but now we can see how his affiliates in USA and Europe are doing the same thing  with less philosophical subtlety, but fueled by much greater raw power. Namely, alt right, if we are to judge by what its leadership advocates, is ideologically nothing more but project of building the simulated tradition  something Richard Spencer likes to call political theology  founded on New Age filtered Aryan myths , racial interpretation of Nietzsche and generally crossbred with do your own thing mentality, all done in the virtual ether of information technology. After all, if we are to agree with Spencer  half jokingly of course  that God Emperor was inaugurated by the act of Kek the God, then the victory of alt right traditionalists is in fact the victory of technological magic the act of pseudo magus waving the same wand Ray Kurzweill and his ilk offer to progressive lunatics . In the end, therefore, we are talking about another victory of posthumanism, branded, spontaneously or otherwise, as traditionalism. The obsession of alt right adherents with identity in general and white identity in particular points to a fact that they are unable to realize the simple truth of Tradition they supposedly defend they understand identity as something that can be created and not something that must be accepted . Observing the plethora of various, rather eccentric individuals in its vanguard, from macho gay postmodern Spartans to adherents to all kinds of exotic  and to a large extent made up  pagan religions one is at the lack to find a common denominator, save maybe for quite unchallenged neodarwinist stance, especially to be found among game bloggers as Chateau Heartiste . If someone thinks that he can reattach himself to premodern spiritual history of humankind  actually the only one there is  while at the same time musing about alpha and beta males, sexual market, signaling and countersignaling, professing therefore his proud monkey ancestry and reducing human relations to mental GMO of memes, genes and biological analogies, he is doing nothing else than unconsciously subverting the very thing he seemingly defends. The allure of alt right lies in its dialectical opposition to political correctness and rampart destruction of moral substance of the West, induced by process of globalization. Yet this is an eristic or, to use an excellent neologism invented by one correspondent of mine discordian dialectic the process of infinite division into ever multiplying opposites founded on the principle of Chaos. It is all done with the crooked half grin, a pinch of salt to every smug remark  with irony of the man who knows hes a liar and a cheat. But smug humor goes just a short way. In the end it morphs into sarcasm and irreverence of what should in fact be revered and subverts the very principles it professes to defend, far more effectively than dead serious PC brigade or techno loonies of posthumanist movement could ever hope for. Well end with the word of warning to Christian adherents of alt right. The words have a definite meanings and power. Theres only one Chaos and theres only one bringer of light from Chaos  as some Kek worshipers already defined the poor Frogs main job . And its not the One to be defined as God from God, Light from Light, but God from Gutter, Light from Darkness. A real Darkness shining in virtual brightness. Hope you guess His name. So, without a pinch of irony, I declare be careful who your hail.  Author Branko Mali is a Croatian author and owner of Kali Tribune , with the background in classical philosophy.

"21st Century Wire says If there was any doubt as to the intellectual bankruptcy and democratic decline of the EUs super bureaucratic class, those doubts can finally be put to rest this week. It seems that Europes technocrats have truly surrendered to their own program of Euro Red Scare brainwashing. The new EU Resolution compares Russian media organizations to terrorist groups like ISIS see full report below. The report also claims that Russian  social media and internet trolls  are somehow  challenging democratic values . The new antiRussia legislation will now require many millions in funding to implement all of the antiRussia programs that bureaucrats believe are needed to counter this grave threat to democracy. A touch oxymoronic, isnt it EU Parliamentarians appear to have lost the plot. Claiming that Europe is currently at war with Russia is one thing, but the hysterical notion that Russian propaganda is somehow damaging the minds of Europeans is a whole new level of crazy. No wonder millions of Britons voted to leave the EU this past summer. The cold reality is that most of the dangerous views and information aired on RT are by presenters, contributors and pundits  westerners , not Russians. The reason RTs audience ratings are growing is because the version of news and analysis being presented is resonating with international audiences who see RTs reports as more accurate, and truthful than media monoliths like the BBC, CNN and other establishment outlets. By spending most of their time, effort and budgets crafting propaganda pieces to cover for the plethora of lies and clandestine operations globally, the western media are killing off their own relationship with domestic audiences. The age of talking down to the public and assuming them as fools is over. RT understood this in 2005 when their news network took shape. 11 years later, western media moguls are playing catchup, albeit in vain.Sunset for Goebbels. Hamstrung with layers of management and editorial committees infested with intelligence agency operatives and journalists on the payroll of a Deep State star chamber that is so tangled in its own web of subterfuge  obsessed with controlling real information, rather than disseminating it  that their media environment has become too dysfunctional for its own good. They are simply unable to do authentic journalism, or speak truth to power . Incredibly, instead of working to help western media to phase out its own propaganda regime, ideologues in Brussels want to attack RT. The faceless force behind this latest xenophobic EU resolution are those in Washington, Paris and London who are still hellbent on keeping antiRussian economic sanctions in place  much to the disservice of many European businesses and their workers who are losing out on trade with Russia. When Donald Trump is sworn in this January, the USUKEU antiRussian axis could disintegrate within a year  so this latest move by Brussels could be a lastditch effort to do some damage as Europes NeoMcCarthyites plot their escape out the back door. From their disastrous coup detat in the Ukraine , to NATOs hubris in the Baltic and beyond, and the EUs migrant crisis debacle, and the tens of millions of Euros being laundered by EU member states through a pseudo NGO called the  White Helmets in Syria  these last 3 years will certainly go down as one of the worst chapters in modern diplomatic history  an abject failure of incompetent foreign policy, underpinned by a backward and confused ideology. We tried to find a coherent western reporting on this subject, but it seems even the western mainstream are too embarrassed to cover this bizarre Brussels adventure. See the following video and written report by RT International . RT MEPs in Strasbourg have voted on a nonlegislative resolution which calls for the EU to respond to information warfare by Russia. RT and Sputnik news agency are alleged to be among the most dangerous tools of hostile propaganda. The EU Parliaments resolution demonstrates  political degradation  in regard to the  idea of democracy  in the West, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday, commenting on the vote. Putin pointed out that while  everyone tries to lecture  Russia on democracy, European lawmakers themselves resort to a policy of restrictions,  which is not the best way  to deal with any issues.  The best approach is an open discussion, in which bright and solid arguments to support ones point of view should be presented , Putin said. Adding that he hopes the Western move to  counter Russian propaganda  wont lead to serious restrictions, the president congratulated RT and Sputnik journalists on their work. In the Wednesday vote, 304 MEPs supported the resolution based on the report  EU strategic communication to counteract propaganda against it by third parties , with 179 voting against it and 208 abstaining. Written by a Polish member of the European Conservatives and Reformists ECR group, Anna Fotyga, the report alleged that Moscow aims to  distort the truth, provoke doubt, divide the EU and its North American partners, paralyze the decisionmaking process, discredit the EU institutions and incite fear and uncertainty among EU citizens . The report suggests that Moscow provides financial support to opposition parties and organizations in EU member states, causing disintegration within the bloc. At the same time, Russia is accused of  information warfare , with such entities as RT TV channel, Sputnik news agency, Rossotrudnichestvo federal agency and the Russkiy Mir Russian World fund alleged to be among its most threatening propaganda tools.  The document places Russian media organizations alongside terrorist groups such as Islamic State IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL. The report also mentions some  social media and internet trolls  from Russia who are thought to  challenge democratic values . It called for the establishment of measures to tackle the perceived Russian propaganda threat, by means of  investing in awareness raising, education, online and local media . It also suggests stronger cooperation between the EU and NATO  on strategic communication . Sputnik has already appealed to the UN, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE and a number of international journalists organizations and NGOs, including Reporters Without Borders, to take measures to stop what it considers to be interference into freedom of speech in the EU.  The resolution hits straight at a number of respected media, including Sputnik agency, and has an aim to stop their activity in the EU. Moreover, the resolution bluntly contradicts the EUs own human rights and freedom of press norms, reads the letter signed by Sputnik EditorinChief Margarita Simonyan. During the parliamentary debate that preceded the vote, MEPs campaigning for the resolution said the EU was  at war with Russia, on a collision course with each other traveling faster than a jet fighter , and that with an alleged  aim to split Europe, the Kremlin forces its information into our countries .

"By John Vibes In the midst of deepening tension between US allies NATO and Russia, NATO is planning the largest military buildup along the Russian border since the cold war. NATO called on allied governments this week to contribute whatever troops and equipment they can to the effort. According to Reuters , thousands of troops are expected to arrive in the coming days and weeks. It was reported that Italy, France, Denmark and other European states are expected to join the NATO military divisions that will be led by the United States along Russias border. On Wednesday, Britain announced it is sending hundreds of soldiers and hardware to Russias borders as part of a huge military deployment. A total of 800 troops, drones and tanks are moving to Estonia as part of the biggest military buildup of NATO troops on Russias borders since the Cold War. In addition to the forces allocated for his specific operation, NATO has an army of over 40,000 ready to be called up to fight at any time. The US military claims that this threatening move is meant to act as a deterrent to the Russian military, but this is obvious a move that will escalate tensions and push towards a possible third world war. This is a credible deterrence, not to provoke a conflict but to prevent conflict, NATO SecretaryGeneral Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday  ironically ignoring the fact that it is a de facto provocation. Just imagine what would happen if Russian troops amassed along the Mexican border and told the US that this move was to prevent conflict. The socalled IskanderM cruise missiles can hit targets across Poland and the Baltics, although NATO officials declined to say if Russia had moved nuclear warheads to Kaliningrad. The United States envoy to NATO, Douglas Lute, told reporters that NATO and the US military may consider Russia a threat if they had nuclear weapons within range of NATOs deployment. This statement is insane considering the fact that the US military is the one that is many miles from home on the border of someone elses lands. This deployment, if it becomes permanent if the presence of nuclear weapons were confirmed, would be a change in Russias security posture, Lute said. If anyone is a threat, it is NATO and the US government. These military tensions are the result of an ongoing proxy war in Syria, in which Western powers are attempting to institute a regime change in the country by funding violent rebel groups. Meanwhile, Russia has interests in keeping their allies in the Syrian government in control, putting the two superpowers at odds. Until now, Russia and the US have been fighting through third parties, just as they had during the previous Cold War, and the same type of situation is developing today.

"By Kurt Nimmo, Blacklisted News In the video below the folk hero of the Iraqi CounterTerror Services and regular Iraqi army takes a direct hit in the battle for Mosul. The destruction of an Abrams tank by a Russian ATGM Kornet missile is good news if youre a stockholder in General Dynamics Land Systems, formerly Chrysler Defense. General Dynamics makes the Abrams battle tank. Each one costs 9 million. The US will simply ship another tank to replace the one destroyed along with its presumed Iraqi crew. Iraqi lives are a cheap commodity, so it will not be a problem to find another expendable tank crew. Back in 2012 former Army Chief of Staff Gen. Raymond Odierno testified to Congress that the Army has more than enough tanks. He suggested the line at General Dynamics be shut down temporarily. Our tank fleet is two and a half years old on average now. Were in good shape and these are additional tanks that we dont need, he said. Congress budgeted more money for new tanks anyway. Rep. Mac Thornberry, a Texas Republican and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said more tanks were needed in Europe to confront Vladimir Putin. Military readiness is a consumable, said Maj. Gen. Thomas A. Horlander, the Armys budget director. Military hardware is cumulative, according to the Pentagon. On Tuesday General Dynamics stock opened at 151.21 and closed at 152.59. Last week the corporation was awarded a 170 million contract for an airtoground rocket system.

"By Jon Rappoport I begin this piece with three quotes from my workinprogress, The Underground There is a media metaphysics. Its basic principle states that nothing exists until it becomes information. Now we have a new twist information only becomes real when it reaches a mind already attuned to it. In other words, the tree falling in the forest makes a sound only if a user/consumer who wants a tree to fall receives video and audio of the event Information can be dressed up a thousand different ways. But it tends to have an elastic quality. By that I mean you eventually get to see the person who dressed it up. Thats a problem for chronic liars who inhabit the press. They expose themselves, even though they dont want to. It takes a surprisingly small push to expose the whole operation. This is happening now, right in front of our eyes. The basis of big media is theater. News is theater. Its directors and producers think theyre doing a firstrate job. But theyre sadly mistaken. Gaps and obfuscations are growing larger. The outright nonsequiturs and gibberish are becoming more apparent. The audience is wising up to the farce. Who are these fools who direct the news Theyre simply people who want to sell their souls and have found an elite buyer. But that transaction doesnt contain any guarantees about shelf life. Mainstream news is decaying, and the expiration date is approaching. Like civilizations, the petty princes of information rise and fall Globalized media. Its nice plan. Lets examine it. The new technocratic media is based on profiling users. There is no impactful news unless each member of the audience is surveilled and analyzed on the basis of what he already likes and wants. Shocking Its to be expected. How else would technocrats parlay the untold hours theyve spent sizing up their consumers/users Several years ago, I wrote Tech blather has already begun, since Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, bought the Washington Post at a fire sale. Jeff Genius will invent new ways to transmit the news to people on the go and make the Post a smashing success. Mobile devices. Multiple platforms. Digital taking over from print. Ads customized to fit readers interests profiling. News stories customized to fit readers interests more profiling. In other words, nonnews. If you thought media were irrelevant and deceptive before, you havent seen anything. The new news will create millions of virtual bubbles in which profiled users can float contentedly, under the cozy cottage roofs of their favorite little separate paradigms. The tech giant Apple has waded into this territory with an app that will deliver news to users. Yahoo Apple News, part of the upcoming iOS 9 operating system, aims to be the primary news source for users of the iPhone and iPad Apple says its news app follows over a million topics and pulls relevant stories based on your specific interests Joshua Benton of the Nieman Journalism Lab said the app will be important because through the awesome power of default, Apple distribution puts it in an entirely other league. This news app will be on hundreds of millions of devices within 24 hours of its debut. Translation Profiling their users down to their toenails, Apple will present them with virtual bubbles of news they want to see and read. Not just one overall presentation for all no, different news outlets for Apples audiences. This introduces a whole new layer of mind control.

Do you believe government gridlock is our biggest concern Congress cant get anything done Weve got headlines for that from here to the moon. Tuned into celeb gossip Heres your world in three minutes. The idea convince users, one day at a time, that what they already believe is important IS the news of the day. Its Decentralized Centralization. One media giant carving its global audience up into little pieces and delivering them a whole host of different algorithmically appropriate lies and fluff and nocontext psyops. And for fringe users Youre doubtful about GMOs Well, look at what Whole Foods is planning for their healthier produce section. Cheer up. Nothing about Maui voters declaring a temporary ban on devastatingly toxic Monsanto/Dow experiments or the dangers of Roundup. Youre antivaccine Sorry, you dont count. Youre not a recognized demographic. But heres a piece about a little unvaccinated boy who was involved in car crash on the I5. Does this sound like science fiction It isnt. Its the mainstream look of the nearfuture. Search engines are already personalizing your inquiries. US ABC national news is climbing in the ratings because its giving viewers lighter stories, and spending less time on thorny issues like the Middle East. The mainstream news business is desperately looking for audience and treating every user as a profiled socialconstructbundle of superficial preferences is their answer. Mr. X, weve studied the little virtual bubble you live in, and now we can sell you your own special brand of truth. Hello, audience. Were going to pitch you on becoming fullfledged obsessed consumers, as if there is no other worthy goal in lifeand then were going to profile you from top to bottom, to find out exactly what kind of obsessed consumer you are, so we can hit you and trigger you with information that uniquely stimulates your adrenal glands The onetwo punch. Any actual event occurring in the world will be predigested by robot media editors and profilers, and then split up into variously programmed bits of information for different audiences. Who cares what really happened In the new world, there is no what really happened. Thats a gross misnomer. A faulty idea. A metaphysical error. No, there is only a multiforked media tongue that simultaneously spits out a dozen or a hundred variations of the same eventbecause different viewers want and expect different realities. In 1984 , Orwells Big Brother was issuing a single voice into the homes of the population. That was oldschool. That was primitive technology. That was achieving unity by hammering unity into peoples skulls. This, now, is the frontier of unity through diversity. We want to make all of you into androids, through basic PR and propaganda and a pathetic excuse for education. However, we recognize youll become different varieties of androids, and well serve that outcome with technological sophistication. Trust us. We care about what you prefer. User A Wow, did you see the coverage of the border war in Chula Vista User B War They had a fantastic exhibit of drones down there. At least a hundred different types. And then I watched an old WW2 movie about aerial combat. User C Chula Vista They had a great food show. This woman made a lemon pie. I could practically taste it. User D That wasnt a border war. It was a drill. And then afterwards, these cops gave a demonstration of all their gear. Vests, shields, communication devices, flashbangs, auto rifles with silencers, batons. I watch drills all over the country. Love them. User E Chula Vista The only thing I saw on the news was sunny and mild this week. I watch all the weather channels. I love them. BUT when a Big One comes along, like the 2016 national election in the US, the separate tunes come together and ring as one. Then the overriding need to extend Globalisms goals in the person of Hillary Clinton blot out every other priority. Then the major media twist whatever they need to twist. Then its the same bubble for everyone. One problem, though. Major media have been lanced thousands of times by alt news sites, and by WikiLeaks and Project Veritas. This attack has exposed the truth and the Clinton crimes. And alt news reflects the growing interest of the public in whats actually happening on many fronts. The technocratic plan for the news is failing. It was a nice plan, but Its turning out to be a dud. Alt media are forcing public awareness of one giant scandal after another Hillary/Obama support for ISIS provaccine liars the collapse of Obamacare the GMO hustle pesticide damageon and on and on. The result Major media are being backed into a corner, where they must defend lies and build monolithic lies for EVERYONE all the time. The idea of creating separate news for each profiled user is collapsing. Major media are playing defense against the rest of the world. Its quite a party. And it has no expiration date. A final note Trump, WikiLeaks, Project Veritas, Drudge, and many alt news sites created a perfect storm in 2016, raining down on major media. It was and is unprecedented. The mainstream press has been exposed down to its roots, as never before. The lying, the collusion, the arrogant sense of entitlement, the desperation, the corruptionits all there to see, for anyone who has eyes and a few working brain cells. Expect more to come, regardless of the outcome of the election. The train has really left the station To read about Jons megacollection, Power Outside The Matrix , click here .

"By Catherine J. Frompovich Part 1 of 4 The following is the testimony I will present pro se without a lawyer representing me to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commissions Administrative Law Court, November 2 and 3, 2016 as a result of my not permitting an AMI Smart Meter to be retrofitted on to my electric service by PECO, an Exelon Company that provides electricity and service to the suburban Philadelphia where I live. This testimony addresses most of the health, legal, and constitutional issues, plus the politics involved regarding the unsafe and RF/EMF cancercausing technology forced on consumers, along with threats of no electric service if utility customers refuse an AMI Smart Meter. There are four parts to the entire testimony that was 18 pages long plus 195 pages of Exhibits A1 thru W, and other documentation I had in my brief case not presented but as backup, if needed that totaled in excess of three to four hundred pages of scientific documentation, published research, etc. Personally, I think after reading the entire testimony, which will appear in four parts, readers can understand whats involved with unsafe, fireprone, and RF/EMF/dirty electricityproducing AMI Smart Meters when for decades utilities provided safe, nonplastic parts analog meters. Before the Administrative Law Court at the PA Public Utility Commission Philadelphia, PA  November 2  3, 2016 Your Honor, Judge Heep and Judge Pell, Members of the PA PUC, PECO Energy Company, the Exelon legal team, and all interested parties Since today is the rescheduled postponed June 27, 2016 hearing and for which I, Catherine J Frompovich, submitted written testimony five days in advance of that previous hearing as per court rules, I have decided to revise and include additional testimony interspersed into the previous 75 pages 10 pages of testimony and 65 pages of Exhibits A thru Q that I submitted via the U.S. Postal Service and which all parties received, I presume. However, in view of the paramount importance, plus dire consequences, of EMFs/RFs being forced onto Pennsylvania consumers with no optout for personal safety and protection from 24/7/365 nonionizing radiation emitted by AMI Smart Meters microwave technology, and my being a fiveyear breast cancer survivor, I submit into testimony and evidence that the PA PUC and all participating Pennsylvania utilities, not just PECO as in my case, must factor in the American with Disabilities Act Amendments, which redefine cancer as a disability, especially since there are cancercausing effects from EMFs/RFs about which I submit into the record hundreds of documented scientific evidence as dozens of Exhibits per the Schedule of Exhibits I now introduce, plus printed documents I have with me in support of the fourpage Bibliography of Pertinent Published Literature Regarding Electromagnetic Radiation, Cancer  AMI Smart Meters that I also submit into the record as Exhibit S . Since the ADA Amendments Act provides for three prongs of what constitutes a disability, I am submitting into evidence a printout titled Americans with Disability Act Amendments Act ADAAA pointing out appropriate and applicable sections Exhibit A1  a twopage printout titled ADA Amendments redefine cancer as a disability Exhibit A2  along with a 43page dossier containing about 240 published studies regarding BREAST and Other Cancers and EMF/ELF/RF Cancer Studies Exhibit A3  and topping off those documents with a twopage letter dated 2 August 2016 from the foremost EMF/RF researchers, physicians and academics in the WORLD written to the North Carolina Utilities Commission Exhibit A4 wherein in the third paragraph they state Smart meters and cell phones occupy similar frequency bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, meaning that cell phone research can apply to smart meter RFR. Smart meter RFR consists of frequent, very intense but very brief pulses throughout the day. Because smart meter exposure over a 24 hour period can be very prolonged  pulses can average 9,600 times a day , and because there is building evidence that the sharp, high intensity pulses are particularly harmful , the cell phone study findings are applicable when discussing adverse health impacts from smart meters. Those five researchers, David Carpenter, MD, Director, Institute for Health and the Environment, University of Albany Dr Lennart Hardell, MD, PhD, Professor, Department of Oncology, University Hospital Orebro, Sweden Dr Magda Havas, BSC, PhD, Environmental  Resources Studies. Trent University, Canada Dr Martha Herbert, MD, PhD, Assistant Professor of Neurology, Harvard Medical School, Pediatric Neurologist and Neuroscientist at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston Dr Sam Milham, MD, MPH, Former chief epidemiologist, Washington State Department of Health point out in the last sentence of the first paragraph,  it is imperative that the North Carolina Utilities Commission be fully aware of the harm that RFR can cause and allow utility customers to opt out of smart meter installation with no penalty. Frompovich respectfully points out, and also cautions the PA PUC, that in not permitting opt outs from AMI Smart Meters in Pennsylvania during formulating its AMI SM regulations, since HB2200 stated AMI SMs were NOT to be mandated , it has breached ethical and legal standards regarding unsafe AMI SMs regarding the RFRs they emit. Various states have permitted safe electric power usage by granting and implementing AMI SMs opt outs, which the PA PUC deliberately refused in formulating its utility regulations regarding AMI SMs thereby subjecting consumers to unknown adverse health effects which, in essence, violate the Nuremberg Code since consumers consent was not required nor asked, and their use apparently amounts to an experiment on PECOs customers. Again, Frompovich points to the letter addressed to the NCUC Exhibit A4 at the end of the second paragraph wherein those researchers cite the U.S. NTP June 2016 study Conclusion in part stating adds proof to the conclusions from the human health studies that radiofrequency radiation increases risk of cancer . Frompovich further elaborates that cell phone RFR exposure is elective , i.e., depending upon personal choice, use, and an individuals ability to turn off cell phones, thereby reducing and/or avoiding similar frequency microwave bands and RFRs exposures both cell phones and AMI SMs produce. However, harmful personal bodily RFR exposure has been mandated by PA PUC Regulationsnot HB2200/Act 129 2008 and, therefore, is absolutely illegal, since Act 129 does not defy nor negate the Pennsylvania state constitutions Inherent Rights of Mankind, Section 1, but its the Commonwealths regulatory agencythe PA PUCthat is guilty of nonfulfillment, I allege All men and women are born equally free and independent, and have certain inherent and indefeasible rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, of acquiring, possessing and protecting property and reputation , and of pursuing their own happiness.  Pennsylvania Constitution, Section 1. However, contrary to that Pennsylvania constitutional right is the fact that mandated AMI Smart Meter RFR exposure, because of no opt outs in Pennsylvania specifically via PA PUC Regulations not Act 129, literally provides no way to escape and/or avoid AMI SMs microwave RFRs. That is illegal and should be prosecuted criminally, Frompovich contends. Furthermore, the PA PUC overstepped its agency powers and, Frompovich contends, is guilty of committing ultra vires during its rulemaking process. The above five researchers Exhibit A4 delineate cell phone and Smart Meters as basically the same animal because both occupy similar frequency bands on the electromagnetic spectrum See paragraph 3 of their letter to the NCUC for more detail, including that Smart Meters over a 24hour period can average 9,600 pulses a day causing high intensity pulses known as dirty electricity . I submit into the record Exhibit A5 Dirty Electricity or Dirty Power and the 10page report Why Are Electromagnetic Fields Dangerous  Is Dirty Electricity Making You Sick including 2 charts  Table 1 Ranking Electric Meters and Table 2 Ranking Electric Meters for Risk of Privacy and Cyber Security from the 20page report Ranking Electricity Meters for Risk to Health, Privacy, and Cyber Security, available online at https//www.scribd.com/doc/289782183/RankingElectricityMetersforRisktoHealthPrivacyandCyberSecurity . The KEY dispute and multifaceted issue of concern in Frompovichs case  being a breast cancer survivor in excess of five years  is her free and legal exercise of legal and constitutional rights to be free of the fear, exposure to cancercausing EMFs, and/or actuality of contracting cancer due to AMI SM RFR exposures 24/7/365 in her homesomething that the ADA Amendments Act indisputably encompass, since once a cancer patient that makes Frompovich covered within one of the ADAAA prongs for all time, and also includes Frompovichs indefeasible right to protect property both her home and her personal body and its life processes including her reputation. That federal ADAAA must be factored into Frompovichs case since PECO has obtained federal grant monies to implement its AMI Smart Meters rollout, and the law states that any business that accepts federal grant money is mandated to abide by the ADAAA, including state regulatory agencies like the PA PUC. Frompovichs refusal of an AMI SM, plus her human and innate right to protect her health, body and property, are more than confirmed when those five researchers point out  the strongest evidence for hazards coming from RFR is cancer , there is a growing body of evidence that some people develop a condition called electrohypersensitivity EHS. See paragraph 4 of the letter to NCUC Exhibit A4 . On page 2, paragraph 1 of that same letter, the researchers further point out a dichotomy in science, which is the very fact that independent research versus industry research studies are at coincidental, if not predictable , variances, as per the chart I raise up and submit into the record , a doublesided poster Radiofrequency Research Does Funding Matter, which shows two pie charts depicting those conflicting statistics. Nonindustry studies indicate 70 harmful effects with 30 no effects, while industry studies indicate 32  harmful effects with 68 no effects Statistically, thats almost a wash, as each just about cancels the other, however, theres a slight edge of 2 from nonindustry studies indicating harmful effects. More interestingly, though, is that industry studies DID find 32 harmful effects studiesalmost onethird of the studies and, yet, the industry concludes differently stating there are none That alone should be a red flag for them, or anyone of scientific mind, to investigate further and they did not, which indicates some sort of collusion of not wanting to know or find out. Is that a crime of omission or collusion Paragraph 2 on page 2 of that letter Exhibit A4 cites the obvious CRUX of scientific and ethical issues regarding AMI Smart Meters in Pennsylvania, in particular, stating With a leading NC DHHS staff member admitting that he is not qualified to review the literature, and the fact that he relied on industry representatives for assistance, the DHHS conclusion is not surprising. Frompovich feels compelled to question how much of that microwave technology industry representative assistance occurred, and still occurs, with and from PECO and the PA PUC, thereby illegally depriving Frompovich and all Pennsylvanians of their rights to protect their health and property, along with the exercise of redress against what amounts to experimental AMI Smart Meter science whose proponents wantonly do not recognize nonthermal adverse health effects from RFRs, which have been known since 1932 I introduce Exhibit T Electrosensitivity ES and Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity EHS into the record to document that in 1962, 1979, 2009 and 2015 various health issues have been identified with EMF nonthermal exposures. Your Honors, I respectfully ask the court to instruct PECO to produce the experimental studies, rather than epidemiological studies, indicating no nonthermal effects from EMFs/RFs. Wheres the science Arent PECOs customers entitled to have that evidence Frompovich also feels compelled to ask this court the following How much influence did the microwave industry contribute to PA State Representative Robert Godshalls campaign coffers and/or his preferred charities that apparently has enabled Godshall, as Chair of the PA House Consumer Affairs Committee, to sit on opt out bills in the PA legislature for several legislative sessions, including Godshalls verbal proclamations to others that he will never bring opt out bills to the floor for a vote, which obviously is an impeachable offence for depriving Pennsylvanians of their right to redress government and government agency oppressions that enable utility companies to harass and bully customers about cutting off electric service if they refuse fireprone AMI SMs in Pennsylvania. Heres what other U.S. states have done regarding AMI Smart Meters Analog meters are definitively offered as the optout meter in four states Arizona, California, Maine, and Texas. The Nevada public service commission urges the utilities to provide the meter that will have the greatest customer acceptance, which, clearly, is the analog. Three states offer the existing meter as the optout meter. An existing meter might or might not be analog. Georgia, Hawaii, and Consumers Energy in Michigan. Three states let the utility decide Florida, Maryland, and Nevada. The Nevada public service commission urges the utilities to provide the meter that will have the greatest customer acceptance, which, clearly, is the analog. Four states or utilities definitively forbid analog optouts Fountain in Colorado, DTE in Michigan, Central Hudson Valley in New York AMR, and Port Angeles in Washington touted as the first place to ban smart metersnot much help you are required to have a digital meter on your home. Two states/districts require smart meters Pennsylvania and Washington, DC. Source http//www.smartmetereducationnetwork.com/optoutstatusotherstates.php Continued in Part 2.

"By Catherine J. Frompovich This is the continuation of the testimony I will present before the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commissions Administrative Law Court November 2 and 3, 2016. Currently, Chairman Representative Godshall is allowing three more opt out bills to become sine die this session, which should amount to an impeachable offense for denying consumers their inherent and indefeasible rights, especially of redress to government, and also according to the Pennsylvania Constitution, I contend. Probably nothing encapsulates and explains the EMF/RFR controversy or conundrum, if you may, from a scientific viewpoint than the 35page report  EUROPAEM EMF Guideline 2016 for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of EMFrelated health problems and illnesses , which is a Spanish language document and found online at https//listas.um.es/sympa/arc/anuncios/201607/msg00069.html This report cites 308 published scientific references, which leaves Frompovich to question why the PA PUCand PECO in particularare so daft in proffering that there is no updated science other than the 1940s era safety THERMAL science regarding microwave electromagnetic energies based in ancient radar studies the microwave industry always trots out as proof of safety. Those safety studies originated in Germany during World War II are totally outmoded but remain the present Federal Communications Commissions rules regarding safety of cell phones and AMI Smart Meters. It is now 2016 How come 1940s microwave technology science is being applied as the gold standard or scientific criterion to meters that will become the key intelligence gathering technology for the Internet of Things Frompovich has to question the credibility factor of both PECO and the PA PUC for depending upon 1940 science in todays technology world of 2016. Wheres the science later than the 1940s Please, may I have those studies PECO supplied to the PA PUC Frompovich, therefore, respectfully suggests that the PA PUC study the aboveaforementioned European reports with medical and EHS health professionals, who are qualified to explain the diagnostics and varied modalities discussed, in order to issue updated regulations affecting AMI Smart Meters and their continuous RFR/EMF healthdamaging electromagnetics, plus their fireandexplosionprone proclivities and occurrences, which definitely was not the case for all the decades utilities used safe and efficient analog meters. Children are the most vulnerable to EMF radiation and, therefore, I introduce Exhibit U1 Why children absorb more microwave radiation than adults The Consequences, and Exhibit U2 American Academy of Pediatrics August 29, 2013 letter urging the Food and Drug Administration Commissioner, the Federal Communications Commission and others to advise the public about Specific Absorption Rates SARs regarding EMF/RF exposures. Also, I want to apprise every one of the fact that electromagnetic sensitivity EHS is a growing problem and according to recently reported statistics in the peer reviewed journal ECOPSYCHOLOGY, Professor Pamela Reed Gibson states the following 26 of the USA population 19 of the Swedish population 27 of the Danish population and 32  of the German population are EHS compromised. See Exhibit V . However, other sources claim that as much as 5 of the entire worlds population is affected. Just as chemical sensitivities were discredited and denied by medical doctors for yearsnow referred to as sick building syndrome or Multiple Chemical Sensitivity MCSso, too, is EHS now being recognized by many, including the World Health Organization. I introduce Exhibit W Electrohypersensitivity a functional impairment due to an inaccessible environment. Printout available here https//docs.google.com/vieweravpidforumssrcidMDgxODkwOTk5NjU5OTU4ODQwNTYBMTU3NTIzMDA1MTQxNTY1NzI0NTcBTVRzdGFEOUNBUUFKATAuMQEBdjI As Exhibit X I introduce a study no one can refute, A review on Electromagnetic fields EMFs and the reproductive system, which outlines science the microwave industry, PECO and all utilities utilizing AMI Smart Meters, plus public utility commissions across the USA need to factor into the inevitable legal liability that they are assuming by committing crimes against humanity by exposing the population to unsafe microwave electromagnetics 24/7/365 from dirty electricity pulsed by AMI SMs onto home wiring and into private residences and all buildings retrofitted with AMI Smart Meters. Before I include my previously submitted testimony, I find it necessary to impress upon the court that it should not be Frompovichs obligation to prove the medical consequences beyond a reasonable doubt, especially in light of the ADA Amendments Act as it applies to those receiving federal funding or even that the consequences of medical problems are more probable than not, since the ADAAA provides Frompovich with disability rights and protections, which PECO and the PA PUC must abide by. Furthermore, it should be the indisputable duty of PECO and all Pennsylvania utility companies  but more specifically that of the PA Public Utility Commissions stated mission for being  to provide safe and nonradiating innovations in utility technology and appliances with 100 certainty, which AMI Smart Meters fail on numerous levels, especially with their proclivity for hot sockets, fires and explosions, EMF/RF constant emissions and dirty electricity pulses as frequent as 9600 times a day No medicalscientific testing has proved AMI Smart Meters EMFs safety regarding nonthermal adverse health effects that I know of. Wheres the science Therefore, Frompovich should not be forced to allow a provenfireprone AMI Smart Meter electric service on her property that would radiate dirty electricity into her residence with high RFR pulses every fifteen seconds. Just to add more salt to the wound, as they would say, there are no assurances that monitoring is not part and parcel of the AMI Smart Meter agenda and an integral surveillance device of the Internet of Things, or that information will be shared with unknown third partiesfor whatever reasonsand for which Frompovich does not approve nor give her permission to PECO, the PA PUC or any government agencies or agents. Therefore, Frompovich feels her privacy, as well as her home and personal physiology, will be subjected to unlawful, unconstitutional and unnecessary interventions at various levels and, specifically, without proper legal processes, e.g., courtissued warrants, in order to surveil her home that automatically will occur from the twoway ZigBee radio transmitter system of AMI SMs and all smart appliances which are built to interact with the coming surveillance technology of the Internet of Things. The times Frompovich makes tea in the morning and shuts off her lights for the night are no ones business but her own. Ive been researching consumer health issues and whatsoever affects human health negatively , including technologies, since the late 1970s. During my career, I was considered an expert witness providing testimony before several states legislature/legislative hearings on health issues. For numerous years I was ahead of both the popular curve and the allopathic paradigm of medicine regarding the role of diet, nutrition, epigenetics, and lifestyle issues in maintaining optimum health, avoiding disease and regaining health utilizing holistic health principles. I am in my 78 th year, thank God. Since the early 1970s, when I almost lost my life due to unfortunate medical mistakes and had to remove myself from mainstream allopathic care in order to save my life, Ive been immersed in whats called the holistic lifestyle. Ive beaten the odds, including being a breast cancer survivor, using holistic healthcare modalities. For the record, 38.3 of U.S. adults and 11.8 of U.S. children used whats referred to as CAM in 2007 per NIH statistics1. Complementary and Alternative MedicineCAM as its called, is popular throughout the world, while in the U.S. there is the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health at the National Institutes of Health. However, the allopathic paradigm considers it, quite frankly, a pain in its professional butt since CAM has become the go to healthcare system when allopathy fails one. Therefore, I expect that I probably will educate misinformed individuals on the negative health consequences of electromagnetic frequencies from microwave energy producing technologies like cell phones and towers, WiFi, smart gadgets, and, in particular, AMI Smart Meters, which are being bullyforced onto electric, natural gas, and municipal water utility customers. Most state legislators, the media and the public are undeniably ignorant of the damage being done to their health. Fortunately, I am not one of those people, thus my refusing an AMI Smart Meter on my house. But, first I think you ought to know some of my background Im a wellinformed, plus over 40 years published consumer health researcher, advocateactivist, journalist, and author. That I should be taken seriously, I offer some of my professional background retired practicing natural nutritionist former registered lobbyist with the U.S. Congress for five years representing holistic healthcare issues executive director for the national Coalition for Alternatives in Nutrition And Healthcare CANAH for five years and, as such, presented FDAsolicited expertise input regarding holistic health practices for its 1990 OTA report OTAH405 NTIS #PB911048932 Unconventional Cancer Treatments 3 expert nutrition witness before a congressional subcommittee opposing food irradiation government relations specialist for a consortium of natural nutrition supplement makers before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration the first Government Relations specialist for the Life Extension Foundation, who set up LEFs government relations department a published journalist author of numerous books regarding health and lifestyle issues with several books available on Amazon.com and my 2016 book, Eat to Beat Disease, Foods Medicinal Qualities. Additionally, I wrote and produced two TV shows. One called,  Turn Off the Violence  was nominated for a Telly Award. That hourlong show was instrumental in securing the Giraffe Award given to persons, who stick out their necks for the common good. The recipient was George Mason University staff member Connie Kirkland4, who founded a 24hour crisis center for rape victims and promoted oncampus nonviolence educational campaigns specifically relating to rape and domestic violence. What Ive shared is much less than half of my background. More would take too much of your time. However, I feel compelled to ask, How many people can match my qualifications to discuss consumer health issues Furthermore, I want to underscore upfront that IF I were a habitual drug addict, rather than an informed, concerned healthconscious researcher and consumer being harassed for trying to protect and preserve my health, I probably would be welcomed with open arms, plus there would be all types of programs and subsidies available for help. Because I am opposing faulty and healthdamaging RF/EMF science, plus vestedinterest snooping, surveillance, and customer data marketing agendas using AMI smart meters, I am harassed and even threatened with termination of electric service even though all my bills are paid in full. That leaves me with no options but to dutifully invoke and defend my state and federal constitutional rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Isnt there something radically wrong with such a construct, especially in the USA, if I have to do that Attorney Ward Smiths interrogatory requesting Frompovichs cancer health records, quite frankly, leaves everyone with whom Ive shared that fact, totally aghast and amazed Why Because Frompovichs medical records are her personal information protected under HIPPA and I must protect them. Furthermore, since the PUC Administrative Law Court hearing is of public record, Frompovich does not want her personal medical records made public information during any level in these proceedings, as that is her fundamental right. I respectfully bring to this courts attention that my breast cancer and medical records are NOT the issue. Whats the issue, problem, and at stake not only for me, but for all Pennsylvanians, is the total callous disregard by utility companiesPECO included, the PA PUC, and the Commonwealth for health hazards, safety, and the wellbeing of all Pennsylvanians, especially those with health issues, compromised immune systems, disabilities, and especially young, growing childrenfetuses in particularwhom RF/EMF and dirty electricity produced by AMI Smart Meters affect and impact negatively. Before presenting into the record additional reams of recent research with documentation and annotationsnot 1940s vintage radar safety researchfor RFs/EMFs and microwave electromagnetic energies impacts upon cancer and health, I feel it necessary to introduce something no one probably has thought about nor factored into the AMI Smart Meter hidden costs continuum , and that is, healthcare services and ancillary costs stemming from nonionizing radiation RFs/EMFs Smart Meters impact upon human tissue. There are mounting underlying, longterm adverse health effects accruing as we speak from PA PUCPECO forced AMI Smart Meter 24/7/365 RF/EMF electromagnetics, pulses, harmonics and dirty electricity, specifically adverse Nonthermal health effects, impacting children and an ageing PA population, which will generate dire fiscal consequences, plus responsibilities, upon Penna. Medicaid health cost line items in each years operating budget for the Commonwealth. To cement that forewarning, I offer the World Health Organizations statistic, Approximately 10 of reported cases of EHS electromagnetic hypersensitivity were considered severe, which means specialized caregiving. That, however, does not include cancerinduced health issues from RFs/EMFs What kind of budget shortfall will AMI Smart Meters adverse health effects eventually generate for PAs legislature and governor to haggle about, when weve seen whats been going on recently to get a state budget passed Has anyone thought about that very real problem Continued in Part 3",conspiracy

"By Whitney Webb Over the course of this years US presidential election, which has been nothing if not bizarre, some have repeatedly speculated that the election may not actually happen at all if an opportunely timed terrorist attack or other major event occurred at just the right moment, leading to a suspension of the November election. Now, these theories appear to have more credence as sources within US intelligence have contacted Pat Milton, a CBS News senior investigative producer, warning him that terrorist attacks in three US states are highly likely come this Monday, the day before the US election. US Intelligence has allegedly alerted joint terrorism task forces that al Qaeda, not ISIS, could be planning attacks in New York, Texas, and Virginia. No specific locations within those three states were mentioned. US authorities are said to be taking the threat seriously, though CBS News  sources stress that the threat is still being assessed and its credibility has yet to be confirmed. According to CBS , counterterrorism officials were alerted to the threat out of an abundance of caution. Earlier this week, there were also warnings that polling places could be seen as attractive targets for lone wolf attackers by individuals motivated by violent extremist ideologies, sovereign citizen or other extremist activity. This has led federal law enforcement to plan for several worstcase scenarios. One FBI official told CBS  The counterterrorism and homeland security communities remain vigilant and wellpostured to defend against attacks here in the United States. The FBI, working with our federal, state and local counterparts, shares and assesses intelligence on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with law enforcement and intelligence community partners to identify and disrupt any potential threat to public safety. However, whats interesting here is that the terror threat is coming from al Qaeda as opposed to the Islamic State. In the Syrian civil war, the US has been actively helping al Qaeda there, grouping their Syrian branch  the al Nusra Front  in with the moderate rebels they support. Therefore, al Qaedas ability to launch attacks within the US has been directly aided by US intelligence, making this announcement incredibly suspect. Its also worth pointing out that al Qaeda, since its inception, has been a product of the US intelligence community. In the 1980s they were essentially created by the US to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan. Ever since, they have conveniently been used as the justification for an expansion of US wars abroad and the elimination of civil liberties domestically. It is also interesting that the threat is al Qaeda and NOT the Islamic State. The Islamic State has been the terrorist bogeyman of recent years and their involvement in any threat, real or imagined, is useful justification for escalating US involvement in Syria. It seems highly likely that the Islamic State was left out due to recent revelations from WikiLeaks showing that their funding comes from the very same entities that donate millions to the Clinton Foundation. It is also worth noting that if a terrorist attack does come to pass, it will be a big help for Hillary. Hillary has been under siege in recent weeks due to WikiLeaks near constant releases of her campaign chairs emails, but also due to the FBIs mutiny which led them to reopen a probe into Clintons use of a private email server. Any terror attack would give Clinton the opportunity to gain political ground by promoting her aggressive foreign policy aims in Syria and the rest of the Middle East. However, as mentioned at the beginning of this article, it is also possible that a terrorist attack on US soil would give President Obama the authority to either postpone or outright cancel the election, something he could not normally do except in the event of extraordinary circumstances. Unfortunately, only time will tell which theory is correct, compelling us to stay vigilant in the meantime. What are your thoughts Please comment below and share this news",conspiracy
"By Joseph Jankowski An organization which has the aim to separate the state of California from the Union of the United States is set to hold a meeting at the state capitol in Sacramento on Wednesday, November 9, 2016, the day after the presidential election. The Yes California Independence Campaign , which is based in San Diego, describes itself as a nonviolent campaign to establish the country of California using any and all legal and constitutional means to do so. The group is currently trying to qualify a citizens initiative in 2018 to get a referendum for secession on the ballot in 2019, reports SF Gate . They will be in Sacramento in hopes to gather support for the states exit, or the Calexit, as they call it. In our view, the United States of America represents so many things that conflict with Californian values, and our continued statehood means California will continue subsidizing the other states to our own detriment, and to the detriment of our children, reads Yes California s official website. The groups page reads on Although charity is part of our culture, when you consider that Californias infrastructure is falling apart, our public schools are ranked among the worst in the entire country, we have the highest number of homeless persons living without shelter and other basic necessities, poverty rates remain high, income inequality continues to expand, and we must often borrow money from the future to provide services for today, now is not the time for charity. However, this independence referendum is about more than California subsidizing other states of this country. It is about the right to selfdetermination and the concept of voluntary association, both of which are supported by constitutional and international law.It is about California taking its place in the world, standing as an equal among nations. We believe in two fundamental truths 1 California exerts a positive influence on the rest of the world, and 2 California could do more good as an independent country than it is able to do as a just a U.S. state. Yes California s website lays out 9 different points covering topics the group believes will benefit from a California exit from the US, including education, peace and security, debt and taxes and immigration. One blog post on their page draws parallels with a Calexit and the recent referendum known as Brexit that passed in the UK in June which showed that most British people are ready for their country to leave the EU. The push for secession is nothing new to California. In 1941 the mayor of Port Orford, Oregon, Gilbert Gable, proposed the idea to push the Oregon counties of Curry, Josephine, Jackson, and Klamath to join with the California counties of Del Norte, Siskiyou, and Modoc to form a new state, later named Jefferson. Modoc County of Northern California voted in 2013 to join neighboring Siskiyou County in a push to secede from the State of California . In 2014, two counties in northern California petitioned for the right to form a 51st State of America, which they also wanted to name Jefferson.

"By Jon Rappoport Breaking leaked 2008 memo from attorney Kumiki Gibson to Clinton Foundation chairman Bruce Lindsay. Gibson had been hired to do an independent assessment of the Foundations practices. Below are key quotes from Gibsons findings. Keep in mind that the Clinton Foundations very existence depends on it being legally certified as a nonprofit entity, in compliance with laws governing nonprofits. Break those laws and its nonprofit status would be revoked, and the whole operation would go down the drain. Gibson Important responsibilities regarding corporate filings are delegated to the Foundation CFO, who appears to delegate them to an outside organization, with very little oversight by the legal department. As a result, the Foundation is not in compliance with the filings rules, including in New York, which requires the Foundation to be certified to do business in the State. Apparently, the Clinton Foundation was not legally registered as a nonprofit in New York. Gibson No matter what the leadership decides about the larger, overarching question, it must act immediately to bring the Foundation into compliance with the law and standards that govern notforprofits, and must create strong legal and HR offices so to prevent any lapses in the future. Gibson The Foundation does not have a record retention policy, and the procedures currently utilized in Harlem headquarters may violate the law. Zero Hedge writes Furthermore, and more troubling, the Gibson review pointed to a highranking but unnamed foundation executive who was being paid by President Clinton, the government and the foundation who allowed the foundation to host what may have been or may have been viewed as a political event, apparently without official preapproval from the foundations legal department and without regard, before the fact, to the impact of that decision on the foundations tax exempt status. This memo was written in 2008. It would have taken then, and it would now take, about a month of investigation by New York State and US Dept. of Justice officials to nail down the particulars and sink the Clinton Foundation. That didnt happen then. Will it happen now Not if the Dept. of Justice has anything to say about it. The Clintons are protected. But evidence of the Foundation corruption is spreading like wildfire.

"Email BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.  More than 100 of Hillary Clintons biggest donors crowded into the home of Casey and Laura Wasserman here on Thursday night, each having written a check for at least 33,400 to snag a ticket. The Hollywood glitterati in attendance  Elton John performed on the piano Barbra Streisand mingled in the crowd  were sending her off for the home stretch of the campaign with north of 5 million in fresh funding. It was a fitting capstone to a remarkable 18 months for Clinton on the lucrative California fundraising circuit, this final event anchored by a host committee of billionaires, Hollywood executives, media moguls and tech investors  Sean Parker, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Haim Saban, Chris Sacca  that each directed 416,000 to Clintons efforts. Clinton calls them her Hillblazers, campaign bundlers who have given or raised at least 100,000 for her campaign. And she has erected an unparalleled and unprecedented infrastructure of 1,133 such people  nearly double the number of any past presidential candidate, including President Obama four years ago. While Clinton and her advisers like to tout her small online donors, it is these bundlers in more than 40 states and four foreign countries who form the true backbone of her financial operation. Combined, this elite 100,000andup club has amassed a minimum of 113 million for Clinton and the Democratic Party  and the actual figure is likely far, far higher than that. The biggest bundlers typically collect millions for campaigns. We had the best base of donors and bundlers and raisers ever in 2008. It was even better in 2012. And its much better in 2016 than 2012, said Wade Randlett, a San Franciscobased Democrat who has raised money for Clinton, Obama and Democratic causes for decades. The Obama people basically 100 percent in are favor of Hillary. Theres really no loss because of ideology or bad blood. And she has added an enormous number of people, especially women. Among her bundlers are celebrities Will Smith and sports stars Earvin Magic Johnson, Hollywood directors Steven Spielberg and George Lucas and corporate executives Marissa Mayer and Sheryl Sandberg, Wall Streettypes Marc Lasry, media executives Haim Saban and Anna Wintour and members of Congress, including her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine, who helped raise more than 100,000 for Clinton before he joined the ticket in July. The Clinton campaign said 45 percent of its bundlers are women. There are also federal lobbyists, from whom the Democratic Party under Obama refused to accept money, a prohibition that has since been rolled back. This club has expanded to the point where Clinton would now struggle to fit all of these bundlers into a single ballroom. As of the end of June, she counted 496 such individuals and couples. By the end of July, it was 871. On August 31, it was 1,133.

The UKs Liberal Democrats revealed that the British government is providing the training in both Saudi Arabia and Britain itself, The Independent revealed on Saturday. The partys Foreign Affairs spokesman, Tom Brake, obtained a parliamentary letter from UK Defense Secretary Michael Fallon, in which he acknowledged that the British government provides the training to Saudi pilots bombing civilians in Yemen. Brake denounced the move as shameful, calling on the Ministry of Defense to end the training immediately. The Government must end its complicity in this murderous campaign, he said. It is shameful that the UK government is not only arming Saudi pilots, it is training them as well. Saudi Arabia has launched a war in Yemen on March 26, 2015, in a bid to undermine the HouthiAnsarullah movement and restore power to Saudibacked former president AbdRabbuh Mansur Hadi. Since the beginning of the aggression, almost 10,000 people, including over 2,000 children, have been killed. The Liberal Democrats also wanted to know what the instructions and advice had been given by the British government on authorizing military operations and the targeting of aerial operations over the last year. The indiscriminate bombing of innocent civilians by Saudi Arabia in Yemen, in clear breach of international humanitarian law, is now well documented, Blake added. In response, Fallon claimed the government helps the Saudi Air Force in order to improve their targeting processes and to support International Humanitarian Law IHL compliance. Fallon said the UK had delivered two training sessions in Saudi Arabia on the process for investigating alleged International Humanitarian Law violations, under a joint incident team it supported. He, however, said that the government has not provided any specific operational advice to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for operations in Yemen and has not provided training on political authorization of military operations. The Liberal Democrat party also insisted that the latest revelation requires an urgent action by UK Foreign Secretary Boris Jonson, who personally signs off any arms sales to countries such as Saudi Arabia. London, which has been one of the biggest suppliers of weapons to Riyadh for 40 years, has come under fire for its continued sales of weapons to the kingdom during its war on Yemen.

Speaking at the 20th Annual Human Rights Campaigns National Dinner in Washington, the Roman Catholic senator reportedly said, I think its going to change because my church also teaches me about a creator who, in the first chapter of Genesis, surveyed the entire world, including mankind, and said, It is very good. And besides, he continued, we are talking here about a country that was based and founded on democracy as a core value. By definition, that means that every single person and every single citizen is able  no, scratch that  encouraged to practice his civil, religious, and above all, sexual liberties to the best of their abilities. And Im sorry that some people dont like it, but to deny samesex marriage in a country that should be the first one to accept it is just pointless. And the Catholic Church should also be accepting it instead of condemning it, which is what its doing right now. Kaine also added that, if all else fails, there are ways of making the Catholic Church listen to the voice of reason, which is how he dubbed all those who advocate LGBT equality. At the end of the day, you know, were a civilized people, of course the first thing well do is act nicely and ask nicely, he said. Then, if that doesnt work, well use our law and our legal system to enable ourselves to be who we are, or rather the LBGT community will do that  and it has. The Supreme Courts ruling on samesex marriage was a crucial milestone in our legal system that proves it works, it actually functions. So, what Im saying here, he argued, is that, while I respect the Catholic Church as Im sure millions of Americans do, you know, at some point it is going to start acting contrary to the Christian faith, and were talking about an institution thats supposed to be the first one on the front line defending it. So, when that happens, and thats whats happening with condemning LGBT rights, well state an ultimatum. The United States of America, more precisely, the future President of the United States of America, Hillary Clinton, will state an ultimatum. And that ultimatum will be to either change its stance on samesex marriage or pack its bags and get out of America. And yes  the President of the country can do that.

Even so, the former secretary of state did not mention the fact that 11 months later four Americans  including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens  were killed in a terrorist attack in Benghazi that arose from the instability that the overthrow created. That was one of the few situations in American foreign policy decision making processes where everybody came together to make sure we dont make the wrong move, and the operation was a success, even Donald Trump supported it, Clinton argued. As with any operation of such magnitude, we had a few hiccups, but it was nothing out of the ordinary. As Ive said, the operation was a success. She continued, So much so, in fact, that Im proud to say that no important people were lost through it all, and when I say that, I say it with the utmost respect for all those who had to give their lives on both sides so that Libyans could be freed from the iron fist of Gaddafi. It would have been unrealistic to expect 0 casualties however, the overall toll did not exceed expectations, with the greater amount of damage being on the side of the enemy. Politics can be a cruel line of work. That being said, I stand before you here, today, and I am proud to say that giving democracy to a people that have not had any contact with it for generations is a wonderful thing that makes all of the sacrifices worth it.

Its agents work in the field is an immeasurable contribution and an asset that we would be wise to treasure for generations to come. If it hadnt been for them, we would not have been able to perform the operation so cleanly and with such little impact to the surrounding nations. I am proud that the United States of America has an intelligence agency such as the CIA. Im sure many here among you disagree with my position that one embassy is a small price to pay, a bargain, if you will, when it comes to ridding the world of another dictator and a terrorist. I would also like to remind everyone here that that price would have gone up immeasurably if we had sat idly by and allowed Gaddafi to rage on and cause death and destruction throughout the region. For better of worse, we acted and I am convinced no other dictator will ever again think about cheating the CIA out of a deal.

"Email An internal memo released Wednesday by WikiLeaks reveals how a longtime Clinton confidant played an unorthodox dual role  raising money for the Clinton Foundation and finding paid work for Bill Clinton, The Hill reports. The 12page document written in 2011 by Doug Band of Teneo, a private consulting firm that raised millions for the foundation and also scouted out paid gigs for what was dubbed Bill Clinton, Inc., the Washington Examiner reports. In one instance, Band secured a 540,000 donation to the Clinton Foundation from banking giant UBS. He later arranged for Bill Clinton to give three paid speeches to the firm for a total of 900,000, The Hill reported. But in his memo, Band argues his double duties were independent of one another the memo was written after Chelsea Clinton criticized Bands role within the familys network of interests, The Hill reports. In the unique roles in which we have had the opportunity to serve, we have been able to help balance the multiplicity of activities that demand Bill Clintons time and engagement to best fulfill his personal, political, business, official former President, and Foundation/nonprofit goals, Band writes. According to The Hill, Teneos overlapping responsibilities worried some in the Clintons inner circle, and in one email published by WikiLeaks, Chelsea Clinton raised serious concerns with Teneos liberal use of the Clinton name to court clients. Band lashed out, calling the former first daughter a meddlesome spoiled brat in one hacked email released by WikiLeaks. We appreciate the unorthodox nature of our roles, and the goal of seeking ways to ensure we are implementing best practices to protect the tax exempt status of the Foundation, Band wrote in his memo to justify his role and bat back criticism, The Hill reports. Band cofounded Teneo with former State Department employee Declan Kelly while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state  and paid Bill Clinton as an adviser through 2012, The Hill reports. Bands memo lists several Teneo clients that he and Kelly leveraged into major donors for the foundation, and also details the personal introductions the two principals made between the Clintons and the prospective donors, The Hill reports. One that Kelly cultivated was CocaCola CEO Muhtar Kent, which led to sevenfigure donations beginning in 2009.

Reports are circulating that the Clintons have transferred 1.8 Billion dollars from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank via a facilitation/abatement of JP Morgan Chase  Company for reasons not revealed. This move of such a large sum of money to the country of Qatar says in itself Hillary Clinton knows she is going to lose the election, and she doesnt plan to allow her or Bill to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a Trump Administration. The country of Qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice. Donald Trump has said many times during his campaign and at the Presidential debates that once he gets into office he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal email server to gunrunning to terrorist groups in Syria resulting in the deaths of 4 Americans in Benghazi. Apparently, Hillary is not the only person in Washington who has made plans to escape justice under a Trump Administration, John Kerry has quietly been selling his property in the US for millions of dollars of late, with an announcement of the sale of his 25 million Nantucket mansion in June 2016 as well as the sale of his yacht for 3.9 million in July 2016. President Barack H Obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a 4.9 million seaside mansion in Dubai in January 2016, another non extradition country. Snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of Obamas purchase of the mansion and the firing of Rear Admiral Rick Williams, however over the last several months these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned, when in fact the information is true. Snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed, but the truth has a way of coming out on its own, as it always has. The Bush family has been quietly buying property as well with the purchase of 100,000 acres in Paraguay in 2006, yet another country good for the Bush family, since it does not allow extradition to any country if the death penalty is a possibility for the crime. If the corruption is found to go as far back as both of the Bush Administrations with any connections to them being the perpetrators of the events on 911, the death penalty would surely be a stipulation of any extradition request. Apparently, if things get going with prosecuting the corrupt and treasonous, the Bushs plan on getting out of the country as well. Interestingly, the Bush familys Nazi connections dating back to WWII seem to have played a part in the Paraguay purchase since most Nazis fled to South America after WWII. Since George H. W. Bushs father Senator Prescott Bush was director and shareholder in companies that were connected with institutions financially backing the Nazis, the Bush family has a long history of being associated with Nazis. With the movement of huge amounts of funds, selling millions of dollars in real estate, and the purchase of millions in real estate overseas, we are seeing the plans of the corrupt in Washington who have been ripping of our country in the trillions, murdering US citizens in the thousands, and citizens in foreign countries by the millions since 911 finally realizing their crimes against humanity is about to be exposed. We are also witnessing the change from what amounts to nothing more than a Nazi Dictatorship in Washington to an actual Presidential Administration who not only will look to the Constitution as the basis of all laws, but one who is going to prosecute the criminals in our government and return it to being a government by the people, for the people, and of the people of the USA. Not the Dictatorship over the people, to the people and who disregards the people as we now have in power.",conspiracy

The consulting company was formed by Band and former State Department envoy Declan Kelly. The memo about its activities shows the incestuous relationship between the foundation and the private business interests of the former president. In one arrangement, Kelly introduced Bob McCann, the head of UBS Wealth Management, to Clinton at an event in 2009. After the meeting, McCann donated hundreds of thousands to the foundation while inviting Clinton to give several paid speeches. Another arrangement involved the Laureate Foundation, which donated more than 1 million to the Clinton Global Initiative. Laureate was a personal advisory services business, the memo said, paying Clinton 3.5million annually to provide advice and serve as their honorary chairman. The cozy relationship with the Clintons put the Baltimorebased Laureate at highprofile events with international players who could help it expand its reach around the globe. The Band memo also includes a section about ForProfit Activity of President Clinton i.e., Bill Clinton Inc.. Some of the speeches secured by Teneo include two 450,000 addresses delivered to UBS in 2011 and 2012, as well as a commitment for three additional paid speeches, if he chose to give them. Another secured event was a 1 million fee for Clinton to speak at two onehour sessions during an event in Hong Kong. The fee included 400,000 for a private plane. Since 2001, President Clintons business arrangements have yielded more than 30 million for him personally, with 66 million to be paid out over the next nine years should he choose to continue with the current engagements, the memo reads.

Second, Hillary Clinton understands how difficult it can be to give up the status of a freeloader when your husband is the breadwinner of the household and the wife is expected to tend to the house, the children, make sure dinner is served and always be in the mood for marital duties.

Todays women are pampered and arent used to rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done on their own, the vice president said. Theyre too dependent, too weak and too lazy to contribute to the economy. The reason for that is theyve learned how to manipulate men by employing one of the most fundamental laws of economics when a soughtafter commodity becomes short in supply, the demand for it rises even higher.

Over the past week, Trump has cast doubt on the American electoral system, saying he believes the results will be rigged at many polling places. The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary  but also at many polling places  SAD, Trump wrote on Twitter Sunday. Trump has also encouraged supporters to keep an eye on voting locations to prevent fraud, which some say is a ploy to intimidate voters. Trump is trailing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the polls following sexual assault and harassment allegations from multiple women. The Politico/Morning Consult poll showed Clinton leading Trump by 5 points, 46 to 41 percent. In a RealClearPolitics polling average, Clinton leads Trump by 5.5 points, 47.7 to 42.2 percent. While Speaker Paul Ryan RWis. and even Trumps running mate, Indiana Gov.

The poll was conducted among 1,999 registered voters Oct. 1315 and has a margin of error of 2 percentage points.",conspiracy
"Email Hillary Clinton swiped State Department furniture to decorate her Washington home, a former member of her security detail has alleged to the FBI. Early in Clintons tenure as secretary of state, she and her staff were observed removing lamps and furniture from the State Department which were transported to her residence in Washington, DC, an agent on the detail told the FBI. The agent does not know whether these items were ever returned to the government, according to FBI notes. The agent was assigned to Clinton in 2009, at the start of her term, but was not on the detail when Clinton left in 2013. The accusations were part of 100 newly released pages of interview notes of the FBI investigation into Clintons handling of classified material. The department flatly denied the latest charges, saying Clinton took home only property that she owned.",conspiracy
"Email Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arranged a 12 million donation from Moroccan King Mohammed VI to her familys charity in 2014 in return for the Clinton Global Initiative hosting its international meeting in the North African Muslim nation, according to an email made public Thursday by Wikileaks. The Moroccan monarchs funds went to the Clinton Foundations endowment and to CGI. The Jan. 18, 2015, email was included in Wikileaks latest batch of communications to and from Clintons presidential campaign chairman, John Podesta. The email from Huma Abedin, Clintons Deputy Chief of Staff at the State Department, was addressed to Podesta and campaign manager Robby Mook. Hillary Clinton was a director of the foundation at the time. Singapore and Hong Kong officials reportedly were also vying to convene the CGI meeting in their countries, but the North African nation ultimately hosted it in a fivestar hotel in Marrakesh, Morocco, in 2015. Abedin told Podesta and Mook that Morocco was not CGIs first choice. The actual meeting was paid for by OCP, the Moroccangovernmentowned mining company that has been accused of serious human rights violations. Clinton vigorously supported the Moroccan King when she was Secretary of State and the U.S.financed ExportImport Bank gave OCP a 92 million loan guarantee during her tenure as Secretary of State. The mining company also contributed between 5 million to 10 million to the Clinton Foundation, according to the charitys web site.Abedin described the arrangement in the email as having been organized by her boss. Hillary Clinton created this mess and she knows it, she told Podesta and Mook.She said the Moroccan deal was entirely dreamed up by her boss. This was HRCs idea, our office approached the Moroccans and they 100 percent believe they are doing this at her request. The King has personally committed approx. 12 million both for the endowment and to support the meeting. HRC stands for Hillary Rodham Clinton. Abedin said Clintons attendance at the CGI event was a condition of the 12 million contribution. Just to give you some context, the condition upon which the Moroccans agreed to host the meeting was her participation. If hrc was not part if it, meeting was a nonstarter, Abedin said. Politico in 2015 reported that Clinton was seen by Rabat as among its most ardent supporters in the Obama administration. Rabat is the capital of Morocco. The Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice charged OCP with serious human rights violations, including exploitation of workers by not adequately compensating the impoverished people who live there. Mohamed Yeslem Beisat, the Washington envoy for the Polisaro Front, as reported by ALMonitor, a Middle East news site in 2015 that OCP is the first beneficiary of the war and the first beneficiary of the occupation  it is the one that is cashing in on the misery of thousands of refugees and hundreds of political detainees for the past 40 years. Polisaro claims to lead a Moroccan governmentinexile based in Tindouf, Algeria. Theyre doing this because they know Hillary has some chances of being president of the United States. And they want her to support their brutal occupation of Western Sahara, Beisat charged. The Moroccan firm mines phosphates. Human rights critics have called OCPs mining product blood phosphates, appropriating the term blood diamonds for gems mined in operations that kill and injure local workers OCP is not the only mining company linked to human rights violations that has donated to the Clinton Foundation. The foundation accepted a 100 million pledge from Lukas Lundin, who owns mining and oil drilling operations in North Africa and in the Congo. RELATED Clinton Foundation Got 100M From Blood Minerals Firm OCP retained the law firm of Covington  Burling, one of Washingtons lobbying giants, paying the firm 1.4 million in fees from 2012 to 2015. Stuart Eizenstat, a former White House domestic policy chief under President Carter and an influential Democratic Party insider, was the main lobbyist for the mining firm. He was also President Bill Clintons ambassador to the European Union, a Deputy Secretary of the Treasury and Under Secretary at the Department of Commerce. Eizenstat specialized in foreign trade issues at Commerce where he worked in the International Trade Administration. Hillary Clinton officially visited Morocco twice, in November 2009 and in February 2012, meeting with the King on both occasions. The two also met in New York in December 2013 where it was believed the two discussed Moroccos bid to host the CGI meeting and the Kings 12 million donation. The Moroccan World News described the meeting as showing renewed friendship between the royal family and the Clinton family, as well as Hillary Clintons esteem for Morocco and its people. Abedin warned both campaign executives that if CGI decided to renege on the agreement, it would hurt Clintons relationship with the King. It will break a lot of china to back out now, she wrote. Ultimately, Clinton did not attend the meeting because it was close to the launch of her presidential campaign, but the former president and daughter Chelsea were present and during the conference were guests at one of the Moroccan Kings palaces.",conspiracy
"Email Donald Trump warned in an interview Tuesday that Hillary Clintons policies as president to address the Syrian conflict would lead to World War III, arguing the Democratic nominee would draw the US into armed confrontation with Russia, Syria and Iran. What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria, Trump told Reuters on Tuesday morning at his resort in Doral, Florida. Youre going to end up in World War III over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton. The Republican nominee, who has called for a rapprochement with Russia in order to jointly combat ISIS, argued that his Democratic rivals calls for taking a more aggressive posture in Syria to bring the conflict there to an end and combat ISIS will only draw the US into a larger war. Trumps remarks come as he trails Clinton in most national and key battleground state polls just two weeks from Election Day. Youre not fighting Syria anymore, youre fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk, he said. Trump Id love to fight Biden Trump has not laid out a clear strategy for combating ISIS or addressing the globally destabilizing conflict in Syria, which has killed hundreds of thousands and pushed millions more to flee their homes. He has suggested the US should allow ISIS, antigovernment rebels and the Syrian government to fight it out and more recently has focused on joining forces with Russia  which has aided the Syrian regime in the bombing of civilians and USallied rebels  to combat ISIS. Assad is secondary, to me, to ISIS, Trump told Reuters of the Syrian President Bashar alAssad, whom US officials have argued must step down. Clinton has called for establishing a nofly zone over Syria to help bring the fiveyear civil war to an end, a proposal top Republicans in Congress have championed, which President Barack Obama and others have opposed due to the risk of entering into conflict with Russia. A USenforced nofly zone would mean the US could shoot down a Russian jet should it enter Syrian airspace. Clinton addressed those concerns in the final presidential debate, arguing that it would save lives and hasten the end of the conflict, while cautioning that this would not be done just on the first day. This would take a lot of negotiation and it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose is to provide safe zones on the ground, Clinton said during the debate earlier this month. I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and Syrians that this was something that we believe the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria. It would help us in the fight against ISIS. Trump has additionally called for establishing safe zones in Syria to protect civilians  as has Clinton  which could also put the US in conflict with the Syrian government or Russia should they oppose the policy. The Clinton campaign later Tuesday pushed back against Trumps rhetoric. National security experts on both sides of the aisle have denounced Donald Trump as dangerously illprepared and temperamentally unfit to serve as commanderinchief, Clinton spokesman Jesse Lehrich said. Once again, he is parroting Putins talking points and playing to Americans fears, all while refusing to lay out any plans of his own for defeating ISIS or alleviating humanitarian suffering in Syria. Moreover, this incendiary attack is aimed at a policy that his own running mate, Mike Pence, strongly supports. Poll Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead While Clinton has accused Trump of being Putins puppet, Trump knocked Clinton for her criticism of the Russian strongman, asking, How she is going to go back and negotiate with this man who she has made to be so evil. And just two days after he tied the successful enactment of his agenda as president to the election of Republican majorities in Congress, Trump also returned to his more typical complaints of a lack of Republican unity weighing down his candidacy. If we had party unity, we couldnt lose this election to Hillary Clinton, he told Reuters. That complaint didnt put Trump in more of a bipartisan mood, though, as the Republican nominee also told Reuters he would not consider putting any Democrats in his cabinet  a departure from recent presidents, who have sought to post at least one member of their rival party in a top administration post.",conspiracy

Because when you try to sow the seeds of doubt in peoples mind about the legitimacy of our elections, that undermines our democracy. Then you are doing the work of our adversaries for them. Obama also encouraged the crowd of about 1,800 at Florida Memorial University to take advantage of Floridas early voting, telling the audience in doing so they can reject what the President called Trumps dark, pessimistic fearmongering.

"Email Donald Trump is again riling up his voting base with claims that the November election will be rigged against him. Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day, Trump tweeted Monday morning. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on So naive Its a charge that even other Republicans have been quick to refute. Critics have called such talk potentially dangerous and detrimental to trust in the US democratic process. States, backed by tens of thousands of GOP and DEM volunteers, ensure integrity of electoral process, Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who is often sharply critical of Trump, tweeted Sunday. Elections are not rigged. Jon Husted, the secretary of state of Ohio and the top election official in the key battleground state, also said Monday that he could assure Trump the election would not be rigged. Trumps most recent claims coincided with a plunge by him in the polls. Before now, Trump most recently made similar claims when his polls numbers were taking a dive in early August. And Im telling you, November 8, wed better be careful, because that election is going to be rigged, the New York billionaire told Fox News host Sean Hannity in August. And I hope the Republicans are watching closely or its going to be taken away from us. Multiple Republicans told Business Insider at the time that Trumps assertion was both ludicrous and dangerous, as Trump would be the first US presidential candidate in modern times, possibly ever, to blame an election loss on voter fraud or a rigged election. Allen Raymond, a former GOP operative who was involved in the 2002 New Hampshire Senate election phonejamming scandal, called Trumps continued insistence that the election would be rigged detrimental to the Republic. The idea that its rigged, I dont know what hes talking about, he said in August. I know someone that rigged elections. I mean, you know, the fact of the matter is Hillary Clinton doesnt need to rig this election. Trumps going to win Alabama and thats it. She doesnt have to do anything. Its painful to watch. Raymond wrote How to Rig an Election Confessions of a Republican Operative as a tellall about the attempt to rig the 2002 New Hampshire Senate election between thenGov. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, and Republican US Rep. John E. Sununu. Raymond said that attempted rigging was centered on jamming the phone lines at the New Hampshire Democrats office in Manchester  a task his phone bank was hired to carry out. Sununu went on to win the election by roughly 20,000 votes. Shaheen defeated Sununu in a rematch in 2008. The operative served a brief prison sentence for his involvement.He said any attempts to rig an election would look similar to that  not what Trumps talking about. The Manhattan billionaire told The Washington Post in August that a lack of voteridentification laws would let people just keep voting and voting and voting and suggested fraud occurred in 2012 against Republican nominee Mitt Romney because there were precincts where there were practically nobody voting for the Republican. I dont even know what hes talking about, Raymond said. But this idea that its 1950 or 1960 and the party bosses are going to roll into Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and are going to rig the ballot box and rig the machines  thats nonsense. An election rigging these days means something totally different than what hes talking about. Now its stupid stuff like what I did in New Hampshire. He said the lack of voterID laws Trump was trying to use as proof of fraud this fall was also bogus. These voterID laws, whats the intention of that The clear intention is disenfranchisement, he said, echoing a common complaint in liberal circles that voterID laws are put in place to prevent minority voting blocks from being able to cast ballots. You know, theres a reason we dont have a poll tax anymore. Because its unconstitutional. People dont vote 10 times, he continued. There might be one bad actor every once in a while who tries to vote a couple of times, but hes talking about an institutional effort. Its a total myth. He said Trumps statements were an attempt to basically sideline Hillary Clintons first four years in office. The idea of a rigged election came to the forefront after the Democratic National Committee had its emails hacked and leaked, though both Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Clintons main opponent in the Democratic primary, had claimed the electoral system was rigged earlier in the primary season. The emails showed that the organization, which was supposed to remain neutral throughout the primary, favored Clinton. Trump said the email leak proved that the primary election was rigged against Sanders in his earlyAugust interview with Hannity, in addition to such claims he perpetuated along the campaign trail. He used the leak as further evidence that the fall election would be rigged against him as well.",conspiracy

You know, I dont want to get into it, because  If I win, I dont want to be in a position where Im saying to you and the other side now says, We dont want Trump involved, Trump said. Let me be sort of a neutral guy, he continued. A lot of people have gone down in flames trying to make that deal. So I dont want to say whose fault is it. I dont think it helps.Trump also expressed skepticism over the possibility of achieving a twostate solution, given the conditions of the conflict and the need for any agreement to be sustainable over time. Its possible its not makeable, because dont forget it has to last  its wonderful to make it and it doesnt work, but it has to last, he said. To make lasting peace there Probably the toughest deal of all, but Im going to give it a shot. Though he was not asked directly what he considers the most substantial obstacles standing in the way of a peace agreement, he suggested that growing hostility between the two peoples was contributing to the current stalemate, and what he considers the root of the conflict. A lot of people say an agreement cant be made, which is okay. I mean, sometimes agreements cant be made. Not good, but, you know, you have both sides really, but one side in particular, growing up and learning that these are the worst people, he said. I was with a very prominent Israeli the other day. He says its impossible, because the other side has been trained from the time theyre children to hate Jewish people.In the past, Trump has questioned Israels commitment to peace, while at the same time suggesting the Jewish state does not have a negotiating partner in the Palestinians. He has also called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a good friend. At a presidential candidates forum hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition in December 2015, the real estate magnate said, I dont know that Israel has the commitment to make it, and I dont know that the other side has the commitment to make it. He made the same point in an interview with AP earlier that day A lot will have to do with Israel and whether or not Israel wants to make the deal  whether or not Israels willing to sacrifice certain things, he said. They may not be, and I understand that, and Im okay with that. But then youre just not going to have a deal.

The Virginia senator said that just like he had changed his opinion on the issue, the Catholic Church is also likely to follow suit. Speaking at the 20th Annual Human Rights Campaigns National Dinner in Washington, the Roman Catholic senator reportedly said, I think its going to change because my church also teaches me about a creator who, in the first chapter of Genesis, surveyed the entire world, including mankind, and said, It is very good. And besides, he continued, we are talking here about a country that was based and founded on democracy as a core value. By definition, that means that every single person and every single citizen is able  no, scratch that  encouraged to practice his civil, religious, and above all, sexual liberties to the best of their abilities. And Im sorry that some people dont like it, but to deny samesex marriage in a country that should be the first one to accept it is just pointless. And the Catholic Church should also be accepting it instead of condemning it, which is what its doing right now. Kaine also added that, if all else fails, there are ways of making the Catholic Church listen to the voice of reason, which is how he dubbed all those who advocate LGBT equality. At the end of the day, you know, were a civilized people, of course the first thing well do is act nicely and ask nicely, he said. Then, if that doesnt work, well use our law and our legal system to enable ourselves to be who we are, or rather the LBGT community will do that  and it has. The Supreme Courts ruling on samesex marriage was a crucial milestone in our legal system that proves it works, it actually functions. So, what Im saying here, he argued, is that, while I respect the Catholic Church as Im sure millions of Americans do, you know, at some point it is going to start acting contrary to the Christian faith, and were talking about an institution thats supposed to be the first one on the front line defending it. So, when that happens, and thats whats happening with condemning LGBT rights, well state an ultimatum. The United States of America, more precisely, the future President of the United States of America, Hillary Clinton, will state an ultimatum. And that ultimatum will be to either change its stance on samesex marriage or pack its bags and get out of America. And yes  the President of the country can do that. And in case anybodys wondering  no, Donald Trump wont do the same because he doesnt care about anyone other than Donald Trump. On the other hand, Hillary Clinton is a shining example of honesty, integrity and democracy, and you can rest assured she will do everything in her power as the president to make sure gays and lesbians throughout America are loved, respected and viewed as equals during her presidential term.

"Email An internal memo released Wednesday by WikiLeaks reveals how a longtime Clinton confidant played an unorthodox dual role  raising money for the Clinton Foundation and finding paid work for Bill Clinton, The Hill reports. The 12page document written in 2011 by Doug Band of Teneo, a private consulting firm that raised millions for the foundation and also scouted out paid gigs for what was dubbed Bill Clinton, Inc., the Washington Examiner reports. In one instance, Band secured a 540,000 donation to the Clinton Foundation from banking giant UBS. He later arranged for Bill Clinton to give three paid speeches to the firm for a total of 900,000, The Hill reported. But in his memo, Band argues his double duties were independent of one another the memo was written after Chelsea Clinton criticized Bands role within the familys network of interests, The Hill reports. In the unique roles in which we have had the opportunity to serve, we have been able to help balance the multiplicity of activities that demand Bill Clintons time and engagement to best fulfill his personal, political, business, official former President, and Foundation/nonprofit goals, Band writes. According to The Hill, Teneos overlapping responsibilities worried some in the Clintons inner circle, and in one email published by WikiLeaks, Chelsea Clinton raised serious concerns with Teneos liberal use of the Clinton name to court clients. Band lashed out, calling the former first daughter a meddlesome spoiled brat in one hacked email released by WikiLeaks. We appreciate the unorthodox nature of our roles, and the goal of seeking ways to ensure we are implementing best practices to protect the tax exempt status of the Foundation, Band wrote in his memo to justify his role and bat back criticism, The Hill reports. Band cofounded Teneo with former State Department employee Declan Kelly while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state  and paid Bill Clinton as an adviser through 2012, The Hill reports. Bands memo lists several Teneo clients that he and Kelly leveraged into major donors for the foundation, and also details the personal introductions the two principals made between the Clintons and the prospective donors, The Hill reports. One that Kelly cultivated was CocaCola CEO Muhtar Kent, which led to sevenfigure donations beginning in 2009.

"Email It appears Bill and Hillary Clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event Donald Trump wins this election. Reports are circulating that the Clintons have transferred 1.8 Billion dollars from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank via a facilitation/abatement of JP Morgan Chase  Company for reasons not revealed. This move of such a large sum of money to the country of Qatar says in itself Hillary Clinton knows she is going to lose the election, and she doesnt plan to allow her or Bill to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a Trump Administration. The country of Qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice. Donald Trump has said many times during his campaign and at the Presidential debates that once he gets into office he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal email server to gunrunning to terrorist groups in Syria resulting in the deaths of 4 Americans in Benghazi. Apparently, Hillary is not the only person in Washington who has made plans to escape justice under a Trump Administration, John Kerry has quietly been selling his property in the US for millions of dollars of late, with an announcement of the sale of his 25 million Nantucket mansion in June 2016 as well as the sale of his yacht for 3.9 million in July 2016. President Barack H Obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a 4.9 million seaside mansion in Dubai in January 2016, another non extradition country. Snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of Obamas purchase of the mansion and the firing of Rear Admiral Rick Williams, however over the last several months these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned, when in fact the information is true. Snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed, but the truth has a way of coming out on its own, as it always has. The Bush family has been quietly buying property as well with the purchase of 100,000 acres in Paraguay in 2006, yet another country good for the Bush family, since it does not allow extradition to any country if the death penalty is a possibility for the crime. If the corruption is found to go as far back as both of the Bush Administrations with any connections to them being the perpetrators of the events on 911, the death penalty would surely be a stipulation of any extradition request. Apparently, if things get going with prosecuting the corrupt and treasonous, the Bushs plan on getting out of the country as well. Interestingly, the Bush familys Nazi connections dating back to WWII seem to have played a part in the Paraguay purchase since most Nazis fled to South America after WWII. Since George H. W. Bushs father Senator Prescott Bush was director and shareholder in companies that were connected with institutions financially backing the Nazis, the Bush family has a long history of being associated with Nazis. With the movement of huge amounts of funds, selling millions of dollars in real estate, and the purchase of millions in real estate overseas, we are seeing the plans of the corrupt in Washington who have been ripping of our country in the trillions, murdering US citizens in the thousands, and citizens in foreign countries by the millions since 911 finally realizing their crimes against humanity is about to be exposed. We are also witnessing the change from what amounts to nothing more than a Nazi Dictatorship in Washington to an actual Presidential Administration who not only will look to the Constitution as the basis of all laws, but one who is going to prosecute the criminals in our government and return it to being a government by the people, for the people, and of the people of the USA. Not the Dictatorship over the people, to the people and who disregards the people as we now have in power.",conspiracy

The cozy relationship with the Clintons put the Baltimorebased Laureate at highprofile events with international players who could help it expand its reach around the globe. The Band memo also includes a section about ForProfit Activity of President Clinton i.e., Bill Clinton Inc.. Some of the speeches secured by Teneo include two 450,000 addresses delivered to UBS in 2011 and 2012, as well as a commitment for three additional paid speeches, if he chose to give them. Another secured event was a 1 million fee for Clinton to speak at two onehour sessions during an event in Hong Kong. The fee included 400,000 for a private plane. Since 2001, President Clintons business arrangements have yielded more than 30 million for him personally, with 66 million to be paid out over the next nine years should he choose to continue with the current engagements, the memo reads. The relationship between Band and the donors was criticized harshly by daughter Chelsea Clinton in another email. Chelsea specifically called out Band and Teneo for hustling business opportunities out of the foundation. I continue to want  and to try  to disintermediate myself from this muddle, edify the corporate audit and existential process we are in  while also being a responsible board member, daughter and person, Chelsea wrote in the 2011 email. The relationship between foundation donors and Hillary Clintons State Department was raised through emails obtained by Citizens United in which top Hillary aide Huma Abedin appeared to vet donors access to the Clintons based on their links to the CGI. In a December 2012 email in which a CGI official asks for Band and a few others to meet with Hillary during a trip to Ireland, Abedin writes to Band, Are these legit cgi people",conspiracy

If we just put all the women back to work, if they were able to afford childcare, we would increase the GDP in America by close to eight tenths of one percent, he said. Thats trillions of dollars over the next decade. Biden made his remarks during a campaign event for Hillary Clinton at Chatham University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Tuesday. The state of our economy could be characterized by a single word pitiful, he argued. Were still battling recession, I dont care what the official stats are saying, America is still in recession. And were not doing anything about it. He added that it was lazy American women who brought about the downfall of the economy, because they sit around on their behinds, doing nothing and squandering their days away when they could be improving the country that has given so much to them. Im not sure how exactly we got to this point, but were here and we need to move. Like, yesterday, he said. Mark my words and mark them well, he addressed the crowd. Hillary Clinton is the only one who can force American women to go to work. This is true because of a number of reasons. First, shes a woman herself and not just any woman shes a selfmade woman. So you better believe what shes saying is true and has been tried and tested in practice plenty of times. Second, Hillary Clinton understands how difficult it can be to give up the status of a freeloader when your husband is the breadwinner of the household and the wife is expected to tend to the house, the children, make sure dinner is served and always be in the mood for marital duties. Shes been all that and shes learned how to break free from it, the hard way, I might add, Biden continued. Todays women are pampered and arent used to rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done on their own, the vice president said. Theyre too dependent, too weak and too lazy to contribute to the economy. The reason for that is theyve learned how to manipulate men by employing one of the most fundamental laws of economics when a soughtafter commodity becomes short in supply, the demand for it rises even higher. Now, thats all fine and dandy when it comes to their personal interests, but if you look at the big picture, its the economy thats missing out on valuable workforce. And thats why we need to get them off their lazy behinds and get them into their workplaces. And like I said, Hillary Clinton is the only one who can do it, which is what makes her the ideal candidate for the next President of the United States.

"Email Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arranged a 12 million donation from Moroccan King Mohammed VI to her familys charity in 2014 in return for the Clinton Global Initiative hosting its international meeting in the North African Muslim nation, according to an email made public Thursday by Wikileaks. The Moroccan monarchs funds went to the Clinton Foundations endowment and to CGI. The Jan. 18, 2015, email was included in Wikileaks latest batch of communications to and from Clintons presidential campaign chairman, John Podesta. The email from Huma Abedin, Clintons Deputy Chief of Staff at the State Department, was addressed to Podesta and campaign manager Robby Mook. Hillary Clinton was a director of the foundation at the time. Singapore and Hong Kong officials reportedly were also vying to convene the CGI meeting in their countries, but the North African nation ultimately hosted it in a fivestar hotel in Marrakesh, Morocco, in 2015. Abedin told Podesta and Mook that Morocco was not CGIs first choice. The actual meeting was paid for by OCP, the Moroccangovernmentowned mining company that has been accused of serious human rights violations. Clinton vigorously supported the Moroccan King when she was Secretary of State and the U.S.financed ExportImport Bank gave OCP a 92 million loan guarantee during her tenure as Secretary of State. The mining company also contributed between 5 million to 10 million to the Clinton Foundation, according to the charitys web site.Abedin described the arrangement in the email as having been organized by her boss. Hillary Clinton created this mess and she knows it, she told Podesta and Mook.She said the Moroccan deal was entirely dreamed up by her boss. This was HRCs idea, our office approached the Moroccans and they 100 percent believe they are doing this at her request. The King has personally committed approx. 12 million both for the endowment and to support the meeting. HRC stands for Hillary Rodham Clinton. Abedin said Clintons attendance at the CGI event was a condition of the 12 million contribution. Just to give you some context, the condition upon which the Moroccans agreed to host the meeting was her participation. If hrc was not part if it, meeting was a nonstarter, Abedin said. Politico in 2015 reported that Clinton was seen by Rabat as among its most ardent supporters in the Obama administration. Rabat is the capital of Morocco. The Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice charged OCP with serious human rights violations, including exploitation of workers by not adequately compensating the impoverished people who live there. Mohamed Yeslem Beisat, the Washington envoy for the Polisaro Front, as reported by ALMonitor, a Middle East news site in 2015 that OCP is the first beneficiary of the war and the first beneficiary of the occupation  it is the one that is cashing in on the misery of thousands of refugees and hundreds of political detainees for the past 40 years. Polisaro claims to lead a Moroccan governmentinexile based in Tindouf, Algeria. Theyre doing this because they know Hillary has some chances of being president of the United States. And they want her to support their brutal occupation of Western Sahara, Beisat charged. The Moroccan firm mines phosphates. Human rights critics have called OCPs mining product blood phosphates, appropriating the term blood diamonds for gems mined in operations that kill and injure local workers OCP is not the only mining company linked to human rights violations that has donated to the Clinton Foundation. The foundation accepted a 100 million pledge from Lukas Lundin, who owns mining and oil drilling operations in North Africa and in the Congo. RELATED Clinton Foundation Got 100M From Blood Minerals Firm OCP retained the law firm of Covington  Burling, one of Washingtons lobbying giants, paying the firm 1.4 million in fees from 2012 to 2015. Stuart Eizenstat, a former White House domestic policy chief under President Carter and an influential Democratic Party insider, was the main lobbyist for the mining firm. He was also President Bill Clintons ambassador to the European Union, a Deputy Secretary of the Treasury and Under Secretary at the Department of Commerce. Eizenstat specialized in foreign trade issues at Commerce where he worked in the International Trade Administration.

The two also met in New York in December 2013 where it was believed the two discussed Moroccos bid to host the CGI meeting and the Kings 12 million donation. The Moroccan World News described the meeting as showing renewed friendship between the royal family and the Clinton family, as well as Hillary Clintons esteem for Morocco and its people. Abedin warned both campaign executives that if CGI decided to renege on the agreement, it would hurt Clintons relationship with the King. It will break a lot of china to back out now, she wrote. Ultimately, Clinton did not attend the meeting because it was close to the launch of her presidential campaign, but the former president and daughter Chelsea were present and during the conference were guests at one of the Moroccan Kings palaces.",conspiracy
"Email Donald Trump warned in an interview Tuesday that Hillary Clintons policies as president to address the Syrian conflict would lead to World War III, arguing the Democratic nominee would draw the US into armed confrontation with Russia, Syria and Iran. What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria, Trump told Reuters on Tuesday morning at his resort in Doral, Florida. Youre going to end up in World War III over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton. The Republican nominee, who has called for a rapprochement with Russia in order to jointly combat ISIS, argued that his Democratic rivals calls for taking a more aggressive posture in Syria to bring the conflict there to an end and combat ISIS will only draw the US into a larger war. Trumps remarks come as he trails Clinton in most national and key battleground state polls just two weeks from Election Day. Youre not fighting Syria anymore, youre fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk, he said. Trump Id love to fight Biden Trump has not laid out a clear strategy for combating ISIS or addressing the globally destabilizing conflict in Syria, which has killed hundreds of thousands and pushed millions more to flee their homes. He has suggested the US should allow ISIS, antigovernment rebels and the Syrian government to fight it out and more recently has focused on joining forces with Russia  which has aided the Syrian regime in the bombing of civilians and USallied rebels  to combat ISIS. Assad is secondary, to me, to ISIS, Trump told Reuters of the Syrian President Bashar alAssad, whom US officials have argued must step down. Clinton has called for establishing a nofly zone over Syria to help bring the fiveyear civil war to an end, a proposal top Republicans in Congress have championed, which President Barack Obama and others have opposed due to the risk of entering into conflict with Russia. A USenforced nofly zone would mean the US could shoot down a Russian jet should it enter Syrian airspace. Clinton addressed those concerns in the final presidential debate, arguing that it would save lives and hasten the end of the conflict, while cautioning that this would not be done just on the first day. This would take a lot of negotiation and it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose is to provide safe zones on the ground, Clinton said during the debate earlier this month. I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and Syrians that this was something that we believe the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria. It would help us in the fight against ISIS. Trump has additionally called for establishing safe zones in Syria to protect civilians  as has Clinton  which could also put the US in conflict with the Syrian government or Russia should they oppose the policy. The Clinton campaign later Tuesday pushed back against Trumps rhetoric. National security experts on both sides of the aisle have denounced Donald Trump as dangerously illprepared and temperamentally unfit to serve as commanderinchief, Clinton spokesman Jesse Lehrich said. Once again, he is parroting Putins talking points and playing to Americans fears, all while refusing to lay out any plans of his own for defeating ISIS or alleviating humanitarian suffering in Syria. Moreover, this incendiary attack is aimed at a policy that his own running mate, Mike Pence, strongly supports. Poll Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead While Clinton has accused Trump of being Putins puppet, Trump knocked Clinton for her criticism of the Russian strongman, asking, How she is going to go back and negotiate with this man who she has made to be so evil. And just two days after he tied the successful enactment of his agenda as president to the election of Republican majorities in Congress, Trump also returned to his more typical complaints of a lack of Republican unity weighing down his candidacy. If we had party unity, we couldnt lose this election to Hillary Clinton, he told Reuters. That complaint didnt put Trump in more of a bipartisan mood, though, as the Republican nominee also told Reuters he would not consider putting any Democrats in his cabinet  a departure from recent presidents, who have sought to post at least one member of their rival party in a top administration post.",conspiracy

Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day, Trump tweeted Monday morning. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on So naive Its a charge that even other Republicans have been quick to refute. Critics have called such talk potentially dangerous and detrimental to trust in the US democratic process. States, backed by tens of thousands of GOP and DEM volunteers, ensure integrity of electoral process, Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who is often sharply critical of Trump, tweeted Sunday. Elections are not rigged. Jon Husted, the secretary of state of Ohio and the top election official in the key battleground state, also said Monday that he could assure Trump the election would not be rigged. Trumps most recent claims coincided with a plunge by him in the polls. Before now, Trump most recently made similar claims when his polls numbers were taking a dive in early August. And Im telling you, November 8, wed better be careful, because that election is going to be rigged, the New York billionaire told Fox News host Sean Hannity in August. And I hope the Republicans are watching closely or its going to be taken away from us. Multiple Republicans told Business Insider at the time that Trumps assertion was both ludicrous and dangerous, as Trump would be the first US presidential candidate in modern times, possibly ever, to blame an election loss on voter fraud or a rigged election. Allen Raymond, a former GOP operative who was involved in the 2002 New Hampshire Senate election phonejamming scandal, called Trumps continued insistence that the election would be rigged detrimental to the Republic. The idea that its rigged, I dont know what hes talking about, he said in August. I know someone that rigged elections. I mean, you know, the fact of the matter is Hillary Clinton doesnt need to rig this election. Trumps going to win Alabama and thats it. She doesnt have to do anything. Its painful to watch. Raymond wrote How to Rig an Election Confessions of a Republican Operative as a tellall about the attempt to rig the 2002 New Hampshire Senate election between thenGov. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, and Republican US Rep. John E. Sununu. Raymond said that attempted rigging was centered on jamming the phone lines at the New Hampshire Democrats office in Manchester  a task his phone bank was hired to carry out. Sununu went on to win the election by roughly 20,000 votes. Shaheen defeated Sununu in a rematch in 2008. The operative served a brief prison sentence for his involvement.He said any attempts to rig an election would look similar to that  not what Trumps talking about. The Manhattan billionaire told The Washington Post in August that a lack of voteridentification laws would let people just keep voting and voting and voting and suggested fraud occurred in 2012 against Republican nominee Mitt Romney because there were precincts where there were practically nobody voting for the Republican. I dont even know what hes talking about, Raymond said. But this idea that its 1950 or 1960 and the party bosses are going to roll into Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and are going to rig the ballot box and rig the machines  thats nonsense. An election rigging these days means something totally different than what hes talking about. Now its stupid stuff like what I did in New Hampshire. He said the lack of voterID laws Trump was trying to use as proof of fraud this fall was also bogus. These voterID laws, whats the intention of that The clear intention is disenfranchisement, he said, echoing a common complaint in liberal circles that voterID laws are put in place to prevent minority voting blocks from being able to cast ballots. You know, theres a reason we dont have a poll tax anymore. Because its unconstitutional. People dont vote 10 times, he continued. There might be one bad actor every once in a while who tries to vote a couple of times, but hes talking about an institutional effort. Its a total myth. He said Trumps statements were an attempt to basically sideline Hillary Clintons first four years in office. The idea of a rigged election came to the forefront after the Democratic National Committee had its emails hacked and leaked, though both Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Clintons main opponent in the Democratic primary, had claimed the electoral system was rigged earlier in the primary season. The emails showed that the organization, which was supposed to remain neutral throughout the primary, favored Clinton. Trump said the email leak proved that the primary election was rigged against Sanders in his earlyAugust interview with Hannity, in addition to such claims he perpetuated along the campaign trail. He used the leak as further evidence that the fall election would be rigged against him as well.",conspiracy

We should never have gotten out the way we got out, he said. We unleashed terrible fury all over the Middle East. Instead of allowing some small forces behind to maybe, just maybe, keep it under control, we pulled it out, he continued. Daesh terrorists, many of whom were initially trained by the CIA in Jordan in 2012 to destabilize the Syrian government, still control parts of Iraq and Syria. They have been engaged in crimes against humanity in areas under their control. They have been carrying out horrific acts of violence such as public decapitations and crucifixions against all communities, including Shia and Sunni Muslims, Kurds, and Christians. In a statement last week, Mike Pence, Trumps vice presidential candidate, also said that the policies of Obama and Clinton led to the rise of Daesh. He blamed Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for the disastrous decisions that led to the death of Captain Humayun Khan in Iraq. On July 28, Captain Khans father, Khizr Khan, addressed the Democratic National Convention, denouncing Trump as unpatriotic and selfish over his statements against immigrants and Muslims.",conspiracy
"Email Donald Trumps campaign debuted a dark new attack ad on Tuesday, looking to further its portrayal of Hillary Clinton as a corrupt politician and doubling down on allegations that she grew wealthy through paytoplay politics.The TV spot hits Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, on controversies related to her familys foundation, stating that staggering amounts of cash poured into the Clinton Foundation from criminals, dictators, countries that hate America and that Hillary cut deals for donors. Clintons charitable foundation has faced intense scrutiny this election over concerns about possible conflicts of interest because it took in money from corporations and foreign governments. Clinton has repeatedly denied, however, that her work as secretary of state was compromised by the foundations work or that she gave any special privileges to its donors.The Clintons have also said that the foundation, which contributes to AIDS relief abroad, among other charitable causes, will cease taking money from corporations and foreign governments if she is elected president.Still, the ad from the Republican nominee claims that Clinton sold out American workers, exploited Haitians in need, she even gave American uranium rights to the Russians.Hillary Clinton only cares about power, money and herself, its voice over concludes.The advertisement is another instance of Trump, an embattled candidate in an already divisive race, going on the offensive as the presidential campaign enters its final weeks. As Trump trails in the polls and highprofile Republicans abandon him, he has attacked Clinton and her husbands character, going so far as to bring women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct to watch the second debate in St. Louis last weekend.Some Republicans had called for him to drop out of the race after a 2005 recording emerged showing him bragging about sexual assault last week. But, attacking even Republican establishment figures like Speaker Paul Ryan and Arizona Sen. John McCain, Trump has promised to plow forward, and some observers suggest he has little to lose.It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to, he tweeted on Tuesday.",conspiracy
"Email The second presidential debate flew off the rails on Sunday night when Donald Trump invoked accusations of sexual misconduct against Bill Clinton and suggested that Hillary Clinton could be in jail if hes elected in November, threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to look into her private email server. ABCs Martha Raddatz, one of the debate moderators, asked Trump whether his behavior exposed in the shocking 2005 video released Friday, in which he bragged about groping and kissing women without permission, was consistent with his current behavior. As I told you, that was lockerroom talk, Trump said. I am not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for people of this country, and Im not proud of it. Trump then said if you look at the history of politics in this country, no one had been so abusive of women as former President Bill Clinton, the husband of the Democratic nominee, whom Trump suggested intimidated those women. Three women who had previously accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct held a press conference with Trump earlier Sunday, and each was seated in the front row at the debate. Mine were words  his were actions, Trump said. So, dont tell me about words, he continued. I am absolutely, I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. Bill Clinton. He was impeached. He was no longer allowed to practice law. He had to pay an 850,000 fine to one of the women, Paula Jones, who is here tonight. That when Hillary brings up a point like that, brings up words I say 11 years ago, I think its disgraceful. And I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth. Donald Trump If I win, Im going to instruct my attorney general to investigate Clinton https//t.co/raPU4ICkl6 https//t.co/IWGVUleEtr  CNN Politics @CNNPolitics October 10, 2016The former secretary of state responded by saying that so much of what he just said is not right but that he was doing it because of his floundering campaign. I am reminded of what my friend Michelle Obama advised us all, she said. When they go low, you go high. And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what hes saying tonight would be understandable, she said. But everyone can come to their own conclusions about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes to anyone for anything. She mentioned that Trump had not apologized to the Khans, a couple who lost a son, a Muslim US soldier, during the Iraq War. Trump engaged in a lengthy backandforth with the Khans after they appeared at the Democratic National Convention in July. Clinton also said Trump had not apologized to a reporter whose disability he mocked in front of a camera, a federal judge who Trump said couldnt do his job fairly because he was of Mexican descent, and President Barack Obama, whose birthplace Trump tried to discredit in a multiyear campaign. He owes the president an apology, he needs to apologize to our country, and he needs to take responsibility, she said. Trump responded by repeating the false claim that the Clinton campaign started the rumors casting doubt on Obamas birthplace in 2008. He added that she owed an apology for the 33,000 emails you deleted. If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, Trump said. Because there have never been so many lies, so much deception. And were going to have a special prosecutor. Clinton said everything Trump said was absolutely false but she was not surprised. Oh really Trump interjected. Clinton then mentioned the difficulty in factchecking Trump, to which he capped off the exchange by saying youd be in jail during his potential administration.",conspiracy
"Email Hillary Clinton declared during NBC Newss CommanderinChief forum that no lives were lost in Libya when she made the move to take out dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Even so, the former secretary of state did not mention the fact that 11 months later four Americans  including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens  were killed in a terrorist attack in Benghazi that arose from the instability that the overthrow created. That was one of the few situations in American foreign policy decision making processes where everybody came together to make sure we dont make the wrong move, and the operation was a success, even Donald Trump supported it, Clinton argued. As with any operation of such magnitude, we had a few hiccups, but it was nothing out of the ordinary. As Ive said, the operation was a success. She continued, So much so, in fact, that Im proud to say that no important people were lost through it all, and when I say that, I say it with the utmost respect for all those who had to give their lives on both sides so that Libyans could be freed from the iron fist of Gaddafi. It would have been unrealistic to expect 0 casualties however, the overall toll did not exceed expectations, with the greater amount of damage being on the side of the enemy. Politics can be a cruel line of work. That being said, I stand before you here, today, and I am proud to say that giving democracy to a people that have not had any contact with it for generations is a wonderful thing that makes all of the sacrifices worth it. And while were on the subject of sacrifices, thank God they did not include anyone important from the American delegation, including yours truly, she said jokingly, causing the auditorium to laugh. She said, But all jokes aside, I have to pay homage to the CIA, who has once again performed outstandingly and saved the day. Its agents work in the field is an immeasurable contribution and an asset that we would be wise to treasure for generations to come. If it hadnt been for them, we would not have been able to perform the operation so cleanly and with such little impact to the surrounding nations. I am proud that the United States of America has an intelligence agency such as the CIA. Im sure many here among you disagree with my position that one embassy is a small price to pay, a bargain, if you will, when it comes to ridding the world of another dictator and a terrorist. I would also like to remind everyone here that that price would have gone up immeasurably if we had sat idly by and allowed Gaddafi to rage on and cause death and destruction throughout the region. For better of worse, we acted and I am convinced no other dictator will ever again think about cheating the CIA out of a deal. Because, in the words of a personal friend of mine, who is a former CIA spook  shutting down arms dealers is easy finding trustworthy partners among nation heads is the hard part, she concluded.",conspiracy

"Email An email published by WikiLeaks on Friday reveals the extent to which Democrats and their allies manipulate polls to serve their ends. The 2008 email appears shows Democratic operatives plotting to intentionally oversample seniors in a poll in order to get their desired results. FYI We are going to try to do an oversample of seniors on the poll. Sample too small otherwise, operative Tom Matzzie wrote to Clinton adviser Paul Begala, campaign Chairman John Podesta, Media Matters for America founder David Brock, and operative Susan McCue. Good, Begala responded. Trump and his supporters have claimed often that many polls showing a significant Hillary lead over Trump have been manipulated through selective sampling. There is ample evidence that this occurs in Democratfriendly newsrooms. Hillary Clinton has opened up a 7point lead over Donald Trump in an online poll that seems to reflect a bounce for the former secretary of state after she wrapped up the Democratic nomination last week, the Daily Mail reported in June. But the weekly tracking poll, from NBC News and the Surveymonkey company, included the opinions of 7 percent more selfidentified Democrats than Republicans  the same margin as the polls topline result, the article noted. The email released by WikiLeaks Friday proves that Democratic operatives themselves engage eagerly in such tactics. Polls are a powerful propaganda tool, and people exposed repeatedly to polls suggesting their candidates loss is a foregone conclusion will often be influenced to stay home on Election Day. I think sometimes polling is done to dampen election turnout, Rand Paul said in an interview on Wednesday on The Tom Roten Show out of West Virginia.

Participating in acts of civil disobedience. Doing what it takes to get our country back. Walshs rhetoric comes as Americans are already nervous about what will happen on and after Election Day. Trumps insistence that the election is rigged, and his statement at the last debate that he would keep America in suspense about whether or not he will accept the results, have left some in fear that violence could flare up if his supporters refuse to accept the outcome.

As it turns out, someone once close to the duo just came forward to share Bills revealing nickname for his wife  but the worse comes as their dirty bedroom habits were exposed. Its no mystery that Bill Clinton is a sexual deviant, but the most recent account given by the woman who had a 3decade affair with the man is damning, to say the least. According to an exclusive interview given to Mail Online, Dolly Kyle was behind the scenes long enough to not only know the twos darkest secrets but even their dirty sexual habits  and now, shes telling everyone. The connection between Dolly and Bill began when she was just 11yearsold. He was about 13yearsold at the time, but Dolly states that there was an immediate attraction, even then. As the years progressed, the two became romantically involved and stayed that way through several of their marriages over the next 30 years. The real affair began in 1974 just after Dolly divorced her first husband, and although Bill wasnt married yet, he would be within the year. Although she was never interested in sharing the intimate details of the relationship, she states that she snapped when she heard Hillary recently say that all sexual assault victims have the right to be believed. Knowing full well just what Hillary had done  between the threats and the lies  to the many women who either had an affair with or were sexually assaulted by her husband Bill, Dolly knew she had to do something about it. Unfortunately for Hillary, Dolly is now coming forward with the dirty 2word nickname Bill husband once called Hillary, among other things. According to Mail Online, Bill approached Dolly at their high schools 35year reunion to talk about  the warden  a.k.a. Hillary. Saying he was unhappy with his life and marriage, this was the least significant account Dolly had to share. In fact, Dolly recalls that Bill mentioned something about having a baby to her. Although she thought he was saying he wanted to have one with her, he was actually talking about Hillary. He wanted to put to bed the rumors that Hillary was a lesbian, even though everyone in their hometown already knew it to be true. Dolly states that the worst came when she met Hillary for the first time. In that moment I noticed that the woman emitted an overpowering body odor of perspiration and greasy hair. I hoped that I wouldnt gag when she got in my car, she said. The sandalshod woman with lank, smelly hair stood off to the side and glared at everyone.

This woman is corrupt and fake to the core. Lets just hope all of America wakes up to this reality before its too late and she can do any more damage than she already has. Bill and Hillary Clinton just cant stay out of the spotlight these days, and the most recent leak about them could be the most damaging yet. As it turns out, someone once close to the duo just came forward to share Bills revealing nickname for his wife  but the worse comes as their dirty bedroom habits were exposed. Its no mystery that Bill Clinton is a sexual deviant, but the most recent account given by the woman who had a 3decade affair with the man is damning, to say the least. According to an exclusive interview given to Mail Online, Dolly Kyle was behind the scenes long enough to not only know the twos darkest secrets but even their dirty sexual habits  and now, shes telling everyone. The connection between Dolly and Bill began when she was just 11yearsold. He was about 13yearsold at the time, but Dolly states that there was an immediate attraction, even then. As the years progressed, the two became romantically involved and stayed that way through several of their marriages over the next 30 years. The real affair began in 1974 just after Dolly divorced her first husband, and although Bill wasnt married yet, he would be within the year. Although she was never interested in sharing the intimate details of the relationship, she states that she snapped when she heard Hillary recently say that all sexual assault victims have the right to be believed. Knowing full well just what Hillary had done  between the threats and the lies  to the many women who either had an affair with or were sexually assaulted by her husband Bill, Dolly knew she had to do something about it. Unfortunately for Hillary, Dolly is now coming forward with the dirty 2word nickname Bill husband once called Hillary, among other things. According to Mail Online, Bill approached Dolly at their high schools 35year reunion to talk about  the warden  a.k.a. Hillary. Saying he was unhappy with his life and marriage, this was the least significant account Dolly had to share. In fact, Dolly recalls that Bill mentioned something about having a baby to her. Although she thought he was saying he wanted to have one with her, he was actually talking about Hillary. He wanted to put to bed the rumors that Hillary was a lesbian, even though everyone in their hometown already knew it to be true. Dolly states that the worst came when she met Hillary for the first time. In that moment I noticed that the woman emitted an overpowering body odor of perspiration and greasy hair. I hoped that I wouldnt gag when she got in my car, she said. The sandalshod woman with lank, smelly hair stood off to the side and glared at everyone. No wonder Bill went elsewhere to fulfill his sexual addiction, as Dolly referred to it. After all, what else can you do when youre married to a stinky woman who doesnt shower and isnt attracted to men anyways Although an affair is never justified, its easy to sympathize with Bill on this one.

"Email It appears Bill and Hillary Clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event Donald Trump wins this election. Reports are circulating that the Clintons have transferred 1.8 Billion dollars from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank, via a facilitation/abatement of JP Morgan Chase  Company for reasons not revealed. This move of such a large sum of money to the country of Qatar says in itself, Hillary Clinton knows she is going to lose the election, and she doesnt plan to allow herself to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a Trump Administration. The country of Qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice. Donald Trump has said many times during his campaign and at the Presidential debates that once he gets into office, he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal e mail server. All the way to gun running to terrorist groups in Syria resulting in the deaths of 4 Americans in Benghazi. Apparently, Hillary is not the only person in Washington who has made plans to escape justice under a Trump Administration. John Kerry has quietly been selling his property in the US for millions of dollars of late, with an announcement of the sale of his 25 million dollar Nantucket mansion in June 2016, as well as the sale of his yacht for 3.9 million in July 2016. President Barack H Obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a 4.9 million dollar seaside mansion in Dubai in January 2016, another non extradition country. Snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of Obamas purchase of the mansion and the firing of Rear Admiral Rick Williams. However, over the last several months, these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned, when in fact the information is true. Snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed, but the truth has a way of coming out on its own, as it always has.",conspiracy

"Email An email published by WikiLeaks on Friday reveals the extent to which Democrats and their allies manipulate polls to serve their ends. The 2008 email appears shows Democratic operatives plotting to intentionally oversample seniors in a poll in order to get their desired results. FYI We are going to try to do an oversample of seniors on the poll. Sample too small otherwise, operative Tom Matzzie wrote to Clinton adviser Paul Begala, campaign Chairman John Podesta, Media Matters for America founder David Brock, and operative Susan McCue. Good, Begala responded. Trump and his supporters have claimed often that many polls showing a significant Hillary lead over Trump have been manipulated through selective sampling. There is ample evidence that this occurs in Democratfriendly newsrooms. Hillary Clinton has opened up a 7point lead over Donald Trump in an online poll that seems to reflect a bounce for the former secretary of state after she wrapped up the Democratic nomination last week, the Daily Mail reported in June. But the weekly tracking poll, from NBC News and the Surveymonkey company, included the opinions of 7 percent more selfidentified Democrats than Republicans  the same margin as the polls topline result, the article noted. The email released by WikiLeaks Friday proves that Democratic operatives themselves engage eagerly in such tactics. Polls are a powerful propaganda tool, and people exposed repeatedly to polls suggesting their candidates loss is a foregone conclusion will often be influenced to stay home on Election Day. I think sometimes polling is done to dampen election turnout, Rand Paul said in an interview on Wednesday on The Tom Roten Show out of West Virginia. When we say over and over someone cant win that is a form of rigging in the sense that it is designed to suppress turnout, he added.",conspiracy
"Email North Koreas Foreign Ministry slammed the shamelessness of Israel on Friday, calling the Jewish State a rogue group that poses a nuclear threat and commits terrorist attacks against neighboring countries. On Friday the Korean Central News Agency released a statement attributed to North Koreas Foreign Ministry that responded to comments Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made last week that were critical of the Hermit Kingdom. This is an unpardonable insult and provocation to the dignity and social system in the DPRK and the choice made by its people, the statement said of Netanyahus comments, referring to North Korea by its official name, the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea. The statement then took issue with Israels foreign policy in the Middle East, stating Israel not only represents dictatorial forces for aggression that trample down the legitimate right of the Palestinian people and indiscriminately kill them but also is a rogue group that poses a nuclear threat and makes terrorist attacks on its neighboring countries with lots of nuclear weapons. The statement was responding to comments Netanyahu made during a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last week, in which the Israeli leader repeatedly drew parallels between Iran and North Korea. And, Prime Minister Abe, we have something else in common, Netanyahu began. We are two peace loving democracies that face formidable threats from nearby rogue states. Both Iran and North Korea are governed by ruthless and extreme dictatorships, states that seek to bully and intimidate their neighbors, and in our case, to actually eradicate us from the face of the earth. Noting that Iran and North Korea have aggressive military nuclear programs, Netanyahu repeated his plea to not allow Iran to use diplomacy to advance its nuclear program as he alleges North Korea did with the 1994 Agreed Framework. Iran cannot be allowed to travel the road taken by North Korea. Its not the first time that North Korea has slammed Israel or even Netanyahu publicly. After Netanyahu criticized Pyongyang during a trip to Japan last year, the North Korean Foreign Ministry released a similar statement, which called Israel a cancer to peace in the Middle East. It also accused Netanyahu of trying to use North Korea to divert international criticism of Israel caused by its settlement activity and breakdown in the Middle East peace talks. Similarly, in last weeks statement, North Koreas Foreign Ministry said, Everybody knows about the shamelessness of Israel telling lies and making fabrications and pointing accusing fingers to others to justify its criminal acts and evade the censure and condemnation by the international community. Besides trading public insults, Israel has long been concerned about North Koreas support for Arab states that are hostile to Israel, as well as Iran. In fact, during the 1973 Yom Kippur War North Korea actually deployed a squadron of MiG21s to Egypt, which engaged in a firefight with Israeli F4s. Neither side sustained any damage. More recently, North Korea has been accused of proliferating ballistic missiles and nuclear technology to Syria and Iran.

On November 8th, Im voting for Trump, Walsh tweeted.

Participating in acts of civil disobedience. Doing what it takes to get our country back. Walshs rhetoric comes as Americans are already nervous about what will happen on and after Election Day. Trumps insistence that the election is rigged, and his statement at the last debate that he would keep America in suspense about whether or not he will accept the results, have left some in fear that violence could flare up if his supporters refuse to accept the outcome. More than half of Americans expressed concern about violence on election day according to a USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll released Wednesday. Walsh dismissed another Twitter users concern that his call to arms could draw the attention of the Secret Service saying, They understand that a musket hasnt been used in battle in almost 200 years. Im serious, Walsh tweeted later. I dont think a musket would do much good these days, but its time for civil disobedience on the right. Walsh repeated his defense that he was only speaking of civil disobedience to NBCs Chicago affiliate. Were talking about a musket, Walsh said, according to NBC 5 Chicago. I couldve said grab your slingshot and lets go. Metaphorically, I meant grab your muskets, if Trump loses, man, were going to do what we have to do. Were going to protest and boycott and practice civil disobedience. We may start a third party. This wasnt the first time Walsh, who served one term before being defeated by Rep. Tammy Duckworth in 2012, drew criticism for an incendiary tweet. In July he got national attention for telling President Obama to watch out after five police officers were killed by a shooter in Dallas. 3 Dallas Cops killed, 7 wounded, Walsh tweeted in a post that has since been deleted.

"Email Queen Elizabeth II is not like you and me. Did you know she is immune from prosecution That she has her own personal poet, paid in Sherry wine Or that she holds dominion over British swans and can fire the entire Australian government Its true that her role as the British head of state is largely ceremonial, and the Monarch no longer holds any serious power from day to day. The historic prerogative powers of the Sovereign have been devolved largely to government ministers. But this still means that when the British government declares war, or regulates the civil service, or signs a treaty, it is doing so only on her authority. And she still wields some of these prerogative powers herself  as well as numerous other unique powers, ranging from the surprising to the utterly bizarre. Most famously, she owns all swans in the River Thames. Technically, all unmarked swans in open water belong to the Queen, though the Crown exercises her ownership only on certain stretches of the Thames and its surrounding tributaries, according to the official website of the Royal Family. Today this tradition is observed during the annual Swan Upping, in which swans in the River Thames are caught, ringed, and set free again as part of census of the swan population. Its a highly ceremonial affair, taking place over five days. Swan uppers wear traditional uniforms and row upriver in six skiffs accompanied by the Queens Swan Marker. The swans are also given a health check and ringed with individual identification numbers by The Queens Swan Warden, a Professor of Ornithology at the University of Oxfords Department of Zoology, according to the Royal Family website. Rule, Britannia, Britannia rules the waves, goes a classic British song  and this rule extends beneath the waves, too. The sovereign has dominion over a variety of aquatic animals in British waters. The Queen still technically owns all the sturgeons, whales, and dolphins in the waters around England and Wales, in a rule that dates back to a statute from 1324, during the reign of King Edward II, according to Time. According to the article This statute is still valid today, and sturgeons, porpoises, whales, and dolphins are recognised as fishes royal when they are captured within 3 miles about 5 km of UK shores or wash ashore, they may be claimed on behalf of the Crown. Generally, when brought into port, a sturgeon is sold in the usual way, and the purchaser, as a gesture of loyalty, requests the honour of its being accepted by Elizabeth. The law is still observed In 2004, a Welsh fisherman was investigated by the police after catching a 10foot sturgeon, the BBC reported at the time. The Scottish government also issued guidance on the law in 2007, writing that the right to claim Royal Fish in Scotland allows the Scottish Government on behalf of the Crown to claim stranded whales which are too large to be drawn to land by a wain pulled by six oxen. The Queen can drive without a licence. Driving licenses are issued in the Queens name, yet she is the only person in the United Kingdom who doesnt legally need a license to drive or a number plate on her cars, according to Time. Despite not being required to have a license, the Queen is comfortable behind the wheel, having learned to drive during World War II when she operated a firstaid truck for the Womens Auxillary Territorial Service. As a result of the Queens training, she can also change a spark plug, Time notes. Queen Elizabeth II isnt afraid to show off her driving skills, either. In 1998, she surprised King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia then still a prince by driving him around in her country seat of Balmoral. Former British Ambassador Sherard CowperColes recounted the meeting in the Sunday Times As instructed, the crown prince climbed into the front seat of the front Land Rover, with his interpreter in the seat behind. To his surprise, the Queen climbed into the driving seat, turned the ignition and drove off. Women are not  yet  allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia, and Abdullah was not used to being driven by a woman, let alone a queen. CowperColes continued His nervousness only increased as the Queen, an army driver in wartime, accelerated the Land Rover along the narrow Scottish estate roads, talking all the time. Through his interpreter, the crown prince implored the Queen to slow down and concentrate on the road ahead. Unlike other members of the Royal family, the Queen does not require a passport, as they are issued in her name. Despite this lack of travel documents, she has been abroad many times. She has two birthdays. When youre the British head of state, one birthday just isnt enough. The Queens official birthday is celebrated on a Saturday in June, though her actual birthday is on April 21. Official celebrations to mark a sovereigns birthday have often been held on a day other than the actual birthday, particularly when the actual birthday has not been in the summer, according to the Royal Mint. Both birthdays are celebrated in suitable style, too. Her actual birthday is marked publicly by gun salutes in central London at midday, according to the official website of the British Monarchy. This includes a 41gun salute in Hyde Park, a 21gun salute in Windsor Great Park, and a 62gun salute at the Tower of London. In 2006, Her Majesty celebrated her 80th Birthday in 2006 with a walkabout in the streets outside of Windsor Castle to meet wellwishers. For her official birthday celebrations, meanwhile, she is joined by other members of the Royal Family at the spectacular Trooping the Colour parade, which moves between Buckingham Palace, The Mall, and Horseguards Parade. She has her own private cash machine. Less a power and more a perk of the job, a private cash machine for use by the royal family is installed in the basement of Buckingham Palace. Its provided by Coutts, one of Britains most prestigious  and exclusive  banks. The Queen has her own personal poet. The poet laureate is an honorary position in British society appointed by the Monarch to a poet whose work is of national significance, according to the official website of the British Monarchy. When first the role was introduced, the appointee was paid 200 per year plus a butt of canary wine. Today the poet laureate is given a barrel of Sherry. Carol Ann Duffy will hold the position until 2019. She has to sign laws. The Queens consent is necessary to turn any bill into an actual law. Once a proposed law has passed both houses of Parliament, it makes its way to the Palace for approval, which is called Royal Assent. The most recent British Monarch to refuse to provide Royal Assent was Queen Anne, back in 1708. Royal Assent is different than Queens consent, in which the Queen must consent to any law being debated in Parliament that affects the Monarchys interests such as reforming the prerogative or tax laws that might affect the Duchy of Cornwall, for example. Without consent, the bill cannot be debated in Parliament. Queens consent is exercised only on the advice of ministers, but its existence provides the government with a tool for blocking debate on certain subjects if bills are tabled by backbench rebels or the opposition. It has been exercised at least 39 times, according to documents released under the Freedom of Information act, including one instance in which the Queen completely vetoed the Military Actions Against Iraq Bill in 1999, a private members bill that sought to transfer the power to authorise military strikes against Iraq from the monarch to parliament, The Guardian reported in 2013. She can create Lords. The Queen has the power to appoint Lords, who can then sit in Parliament, the upper house in Britains legislative system. Like many other powers, this is exercised only on the advice of elected government ministers. She doesnt have to pay tax but she does anyway. The Queen does not have to pay tax, but she has been voluntarily paying income tax and capital gains tax since 1992. The Queen has the power to form governments. Unlike the Queen, Prime Minister David Cameron doesnt literally sit on a throne. Rob Stothard/Getty Images/HBO/BI The Queen previously wielded the power to dissolve Parliament and call a general election, but the FixedTerm Parliaments Act put an end to that in 2011. Now a twothirds vote in the commons is required to dissolve Parliament before a fiveyear fixedterm is up. She does still play a part after an election, however, when she calls on the MP most able to form a government to do so. This caused some worry ahead of this years General Election. It once looked as if the Conservatives might not have a majority but would be the largest party and would try to form a government. Meanwhile, it was feasible that Labour could form a majority, despite having fewer seats, by entering into a coalition with multiple other parties. In this situation, the Queen would have been stuck between a rock and a hard place. Every year, she opens Parliament with the Queens speech, which lays out the governments plans. But to give David Camerons speech would arguably be to tacitly endorse his government  while staying away would send the opposite message. At one point, The Times was told by sources that she planned to stay away if Cameron failed to secure enough MPs, but the Palace later had an aboutface. Royal sources confirmed she would lead proceedings, even if there was a risk the speech would be overthrown the following week because the Tories had failed to muster enough backing from smaller parties, The Times subsequently reported. She has knights. Sure, they no longer ride around on horseback wooing maidens with their tales of valour, but Britain still retains knights. Like Lords, they are appointed by the Queen  and she knights them personally. Knighthoods are typically given to figures who have made a particular contribution to British society  whether in business, the arts, the military, or elsewhere. After Terry Pratchett was knighted, the legendary fantasy author forged himself a special sword using pieces of a meteorite. The individuals knighted are decided by ministers, the BBC reports, who present her with a list of nominees each year for her approval. She is exempt from Freedom Of Information requests. All information about the royal family is exempt from Freedom of Information requests. The exemption was made after a legal battle between The Guardian and the government to have letters from Prince Charles sent to Whitehall ministers made public. The socalled black spider memos were recently released, but the change means the same cant happen in the future. She can ignore or overrule ministerial advice in grave constitutional crisis. While the overwhelming majority of the Queens prerogative powers are devolved to her ministers, there is one exception that allows her to wield power herself. Only in grave constitutional crisis, the Sovereign can act contrary to or without Ministerial advice. With no precedent in modern times, its not clear what would actually constitute this, but the possibility remains. The Queen holds the ability to fire the entire Australian government. As the head of state in Australia, the Queen has certain powers over the government. In 1975, for example, the Queens representative in the country at the time, Gov. Gen. Sir John Kerr, fired the prime minister in response to a government shutdown. Kerr appointed a replacement, who immediately passed the spending bill to fund the government, Max Fisher wrote in The Washington Post. Three hours later, Kerr dismissed the rest of Parliament. Then Australia held elections to restart from scratch. And they havent had another shutdown since. In addition to the UK and Australia, the Queen is also the head of state in Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu. All the above are Commonwealth Realms, or former British colonies. The British sovereign retains the position she holds in the United Kingdom, that of head of state. As in Britain, this is largely a ceremonial role from day to day. Shes the head of a religion. Queen Elizabeth II is the head of the Church of England, Britains state religion first established after King Henry VIII split away from the Catholic Church in Rome in the 16th century. Her formal title is defender of the faith and supreme governor of the Church of England, and she also has the power to appoint Bishops and Archbishops. As with many of her other powers, however, this is exercised only on the advice of the prime minister, who himself takes advice from a Church Commission. An interesting side effect of this is that the Sovereign must be a confirmed member of Church of England. Catholics and those of other religions may not ascend to the British throne. If Prince Charles converted to Islam, for example, he would be unable to become king after Queen Elizabeth II dies. She gets to give away special money to the elderly. Maundy money is a special kind of silver coin the Queen gives away to pensioners every year at a UK cathedral every Easter in a special ceremony. The number of recipients corresponds with the Sovereigns age. This year, for example, she will be 89 when Easter rolls around, so she will give maundy money away to 89 pensioners. The coins are technically legal tender, despite coming in unconventional 3pence and 4pence denominations. But given the coins rare status, they tend not to enter general circulation. Shes also immune from prosecution. All prosecutions are carried out in the name of the Sovereign, and she is both immune from prosecution and cannot be compelled to give evidence in court. In theory, the Sovereign is incapable of thinking or doing wrong, legal scholar John Kirkhope told Business Insider. However, barrister Baroness Helena Kennedy QC told the BBC in 2002 that nowadays, that immunity is questionable. Although civil and criminal proceedings cannot be taken against the Sovereign as a person under UK law, the Queen is careful to ensure that all her activities in her personal capacity are carried out in strict accordance with the law, according to official site of the Monarchy. If the monarch did commit a grievance offence, he or she would almost certainly be forced to abdicate. There is at least one precedent of the Courts prosecuting the Sovereign. In the 17th Century, King Charles I was tried for treason following the English Civil War. He said no earthly power can justly call me who am your King in question as a delinquent. The Court disagreed and had him executed. The Queen has the right to be consulted, to encourage, and to warn her ministers. Assuming no grave constitutional crisis, the Queens input into the legislative process is supposed to be limited in real terms to the right to be consulted, to encourage, and to warn her ministers  advice delivered via meetings with the prime minister. The Queen also has certain historic rights and privileges. John Kirkhope, a lawyer who successfully campaigned to have details of Queens consent made public, provided Business Insider with a list of some of the stranger rights the Queen still holds. Hungerford has to present a red rose to the Sovereign in exchange for its fishing and grazing rights.The Duke of Atholl must pay by way of a rose whenever the Sovereign calls. This most recently happened during the reign of Queen Victoria, so its unclear whether the rose has to be any particular colour.If the Sovereign passes near Kidwelly Castle in Wales, the tenant has to provide a bodyguard in full armour. This is complicated slightly by the fact the castle is a ruin.The Marquis of Ailesbury owns Savernake Forest and is required to produce a blast on a hunting horn should the Sovereign pass through the Forest. This last happened in 1943.Similarly, the owner of Dunlambert Castle in Northern Ireland has to produce a blast on an ancient bugle.And lastly, many landowners must also pay a quitrent  a kind of tax on their property paid to the Monarch. Some are pretty unusual. The owner of Sauchlemuir Castle must set out three glasses of port on New Years Eve for the grandmother of James IV of Scotland. For reference, James IV served from 1474 to 1513.The owner of Fowlis must deliver  when required  a snowball in midsummer.The City of Gloucester pays for its holdings of Crown Lands by providing an enormous eel pie.Great Yarmouth must provide a hundred herrings baked in 24 pasties to the Sheriff, who then sends them to the Lord of the Manor  who then sends them to the Sovereign.The Duke of Marlborough has to present a small satin flag with a Fleur de Lys on August 13, the anniversary of the Battle of Blenheim.The Duke of Wellington has to present a French Tricolour flag before noon on June 19  the anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo.",conspiracy
"/ south africa Issues surrounding a minimum wage bill, education and services are being utilized in attempts to overthrow the African National Congress South African President Jacob Zuma has come out publically to state that there are efforts underway by the West to undermine the African National Congress ANC government which has held power for over 22 years. A myriad of challenges are facing the South African ruling party including an economic recession, the bringing of several allegations about corruption within the office of the presidency, a declining stock market and national currency along with increasingly worsening relations with the United States. In Africa there are numerous examples from the postcolonial period of the last five decades where the intelligence and military apparatuses of the imperialist states have sought to reverse the forward progress of the masses of workers, farmers, youth and their leadership. In the recent period in the South American state of Brazil, the first woman President Dilma Rousseff of the Workers Party, was forcefully removed from office in a political coup. In addition to the decline in the South African economy largely due to the overall world crisis which has driven down commodity prices and systematically disinvested from the emerging states, there has been a fracturing of the national democratic movement and the workers organizations over contentious debates surrounding a way forward. In an October report delivered at the World Federation of Trade Unions WFTU 17 th Congress in Durban, South Africa, Dr. Blade Nzimande, the Secretary General of the South African Communist Party SACP, placed these contradictions inside the national democratic revolution and the largest trade union federation, the Congress of South African Trade Unions COSATU, within a broader context of the desire by the imperialist states to reverse the advances of the liberation struggles. In a recent article published by the Agence France Press AFP, President Zuma emphasized that Western powers want to remove the ANC because they do not want the ANC to develop relations with those countries which helped the party in the antiapartheid struggle. This statement was made by President Zuma on Nov. 19 laid the blame directly on certain Western countries which do not wish the ruling African National Congress success. Zuma spoke to ANC supporters at a rally in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga Province that the imperialist states were utilizing some ANC members to further their agenda, adding that some party members had been won over to the views of Western countries. The president said that those ANC members calling for his resignation were in fact serving the interests of the Western states. The Political Economy of Destabilization Since 1994 there have been substantial reforms initiated under the ANC government. There has been the construction of housing for the poor and working class, the expansion of healthcare, the breaking down of racial barriers in public facilities, along with access to household utilities and clean drinking water. However, the fundamental relations and ownership of production remains under the control of the capitalist class. As a manifestation of modernday capitalism, high unemployment, rising costs of living including education fees as well as problems associated with service delivery, have continued. In all other countries, the majority controls everything from politics, economy and defense . . . Its only in this country South Africa where we dont have economic freedom. Its controlled by the minority and those who oppressed us, Zuma stressed. AFP, Nov. 21 The president went on to say That is why they are scared that we will take away this economy. They want to take away the strength of the ANC because they know the ANC is the only organization trying to balance the scales. Zuma said that his government would not break ties with longtime friends internationally in order to win the approval of the imperialist governments. The president had also spoke at the WFTU 17 th Congress noting that the capitalist system would not relinquish concessions to the working class without demands based upon mass struggle. Recounting the history of the national liberation movement in South Africa, Zuma said Socialist countries like Russia and China helped the ANC, giving it military training and aid during the antiapartheid struggle. The socialist countries came to our aid. It was Russia who trained us and helped us with the tools to fight. China and other socialist countries helped us. In addition Zuma said the Western states are retaliating against the ANC government due its affiliation with the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa BRICS Summit. The advent of such blocs among the emerging states was a threat to Western hegemony of the world economy. They are fighting us because we joined BRICS. Some are in ANC gear but are in the company of the West. We are at war. We are going to protect the ANC, Zuma emphasized. In an article published by the South African Mail  Guardian in reference to the stock values of holdings traded on the local market, it noted Should South Africa avoid having its credit rating cut to junk in the next two weeks, it could just be staving off the inevitable. More than half of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg said SP Global Ratings will strip the nation of its investmentlevel rating. The median probability of South Africa retaining its current assessment in December is 45, falling to only 20 in 2017, the survey shows. The economy faces a cut to junk on its foreigncurrency credit rating as output is forecast to expand at the slowest pace this year since a 2009 recession, delaying the governments plans to narrow the shortfall on the budget and rein in debt. Nov. 18 Debate Surrounds a National Minimum Wage Amid Allegation of Regime Change Agenda The ANC government has proposed the adoption of a national monthly minimum wage of 3,500 rand which is approximately 242 U.S. dollars. 47 percent of the working population earns less than this proposed amount. BBC, Nov. 21 Despite the possible introduction of such legislation, it falls far short of what is actually needed to maintain a basic household. Prof. Chris Malikane of the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg suggested that 12,000 rand per month was essential in maintaining a decent home. BBC, Nov. 21 This issue is controversial among the business interests which claim that any significant governmentmandated increase in the minimum wage would create further unemployment which stands officially at around 25 percent. Over the last few years there have been largescale job losses in the mining sector which is impacting economic recovery. Two years ago COSATU proposed a minimum wage of 4500 rand per month. With inflation since 2014 the amount would be at least 5000 today. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa said the 3,500 rand per month figure was decided by a panel of experts. Ramaphosa said We are now a step closer to finalizing discussions on the national minimum wage. All social partners will now decide what their take is. BBC, Nov. 21 The ANC must address the issues of joblessness, poverty and service delivery in order to win back its twothirds majority electoral base inside the country. Local governmental elections which were held in August saw a decline in support for the ruling party by approximately ten points although it remains by far the most popular party in South Africa winning 54 percent of the votes in the August poll. A commission report issued several weeks ago alleged that the government of President Zuma has been involved in corruption. Zuma has denied the charges and attempts to pass motions of noconfidence in parliament failed on numerous occasions. The current ANC leadership seems solidly committed to keeping Zuma in office until his term expires in 2019. The party maintains that Washington through its embassy in Pretoria is pursuing a regimechange agenda. Party spokesperson Zize Kodwa stated in March They have taken about 45 young people to America to train them as part of their leadership program. What we got from those young people is not what they expected they were trained on how to destabilize the country and regime change. Xinhua News Agency, March 16",conspiracy

"There May Be Another Planet in Our Solar System It could be responsible for tilting the sun Image Credits fotomanu93/Flickr . Earlier this year an announcement raised a tantalizing possibility a ninth planet lurking in the outer reaches of our solar system. The announcement turned the astronomy and planetary science world upside down. Caltech astronomer Michael Brown and theoretical astrophysicist Konstantin Batygin found evidence for a possible 10 Earth mass planet that may be tilting longorbiting dwarf planets on their sides and shepherding them into clusters far past the orbit of Neptune in highly eccentric orbits. In the last several months, more and more papers have been published about the possible planet and how it might prove an explanation for other strange things happening in our solar system. At a press conference held this afternoon, at the AAS Division of Planetary Sciences annual meeting in Pasadena Ca, another announcement was made about Planet Nines effects on the spinaxis tilt of our Sun.

"Getting 10 Minutes of Sunlight Per Day Can Stop Depression Vitamin D is one of the most important vitamins your body needs Image Credits Michael Pollak/Flickr . Vitamin D is one of the most important vitamins you can give your body. This vitamin can affect nearly 2,000 genes in your body, and the best part of it is that you dont even need a supplement to get your full recommended amount of vitamin D  you only need to get out in the sun for a few minutes a day. Vitamin D is beneficial for staving off depression. Without the required amount of vitamin D in your diet or the necessary amount of time spent in the sun, you can experience and excessively low mood and other signs of depression. And one of the most wellknown and important benefits of vitamin D is the effect it has an calcium absorption and building healthy bones. This is especially important for children, as the vitamin helps with bone growth as well as developing strong teeth. Those who do not have enough vitamin D may find themselves at risk for fractures or soft bones. Thus, vitamin D is not only important for children, but also women who can be susceptible to brittle bones as they age. The vitamin may also play a crucial role in helping your body ward off disease. Studies suggest that getting in enough vitamin D can help ward off multiple sclerosis, heart disease and help your body steer clear of the dreaded flu. If you dont get enough vitamin D, you may find yourself feeling tired or experiencing general aches and pains. If the deficiency is severe enough, you may also find yourself developing stress fractures. So how do you get enough vitamin D in your diet You can always purchase supplements, most of which contain enough, or in some cases, more than enough of your daily recommended allowance. It is also naturally found in salmon, sardines, egg yolk and shrimp. Milk, cereal, yogurt and orange juice are often fortified with vitamin D to ensure that you get the recommended amount. For those who live in a sunny climate, spending 10 minutes outside per day can actually give you the required amount of vitamin D. Although it is not advisable to spend too long outside without protection from the sun in the form of sun block or extra layers of clothing, it is recommended that you do get outside for at least a small part of the day to soak up those rays. You can, however, get all of the benefits of vitamin D in your diet or by taking supplements during the winter months when the sun takes a rest, or if you happen to live in a colder climate.

"The War Against Payday Lending Apple uses similar tactics with iPhone Jonathan Lee  Mises.org  October 26, 2016 Comments Image Credits flickr, khrawlings . In June of 2016, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB put forward a proposal to regulate the shortterm loan industry. The Small Dollar Lending Rule seeks to alleviate and solve for the apparent weaknesses of the current rates and shortterm lenders by requiring lenders to assess and verify a borrowers income, housing costs, and credit and legal obligations. The intention of the proposal is to protect lowincome families from being caught in an endless cycle where many are forced to take out another loan to make ends meet. At first glance, it seems that the rule would solve problems in an industry known for its dirtiness. Except policymakers are thinking with their hearts while sitting in their airconditioned offices, away from the facts and any form of interaction with the real world of shortterm loans. Just the fact that they see the shortterm loan industry as dirty supplies sufficient reason to believe that either these policymakers are ignorantly prejudiced or plainly manipulative. Instead of pointing fingers and name calling at the shortterm lending industry, they should be applying simple economics to their proposals to see if they hold water. In Understanding the CFPB Proposal for Payday and Other Small Loans, a paper released by the CFPB and PEW Charitable Trusts, the Bureau aimed to make several arguments in favor of new legislation. The first of its arguments is that, with payday and vehicle title loan markets, lenders and borrowers interests are not aligned because profitability for lenders depends on loans being unaffordable for customers. But doesnt this argument stand for any industry that sells a product For example, are the interests of iPhone sellers and buyers aligned in the manner acceptable to the CFPB Each additional iPhone 6 is said to cost 200.10 to produce and is sold for 699 dollars. That is 3 times its cost to make. To borrow a phrase from the left, thats pricegouging to the tune of 300 percent. Yet there is no noise from policymakers claiming to call Apple a company that cheats its customers. So why should shortterm lenders be held accountable in any way that is different than Apple Shouldnt shortterm lenders be able to charge interest rates that makeup for the huge risk they incur in lending money out to lowincome borrowers Studies show these lenders charge on average 15 percent, or 15 for every 100 loaned  a profit margin that is significantly less than the price percentage difference of products in other markets. The second of the CFPBs arguments is that to solve for balloon payments, or the cycle of continued borrowing to pay off loans, the CFPB would require that most products become installment loans with smaller, manageable payments. The problem with this statement is that the Bureau completely ignores the reason why shortterm loans are so available to borrowers  its because shortterm loan companies can offset risk by requiring borrowers to weigh their own risk against their need to borrow. Simply put, the short payment periods are put in place to deter those who definitely should not borrow. Additionally, making the periods longer and the payments smaller defeats the business model, making shortterm lenders irrelevant because their models are defined by their expediency. The third of the CFPBs arguments is that their proposal would solve the problems related to price gouge lending by requiring lenders to evaluate borrowers financial condition, by forcing borrowers to submit written statements on income, housing expenses, all outstanding debt, and child support. Meanwhile, the lender is required to obtain a national credit report, and then deliver that data to all proposed credit tracking agencies. Remember all of these governmentimposed requirements cost the shortterm lenders money. The cost of finding out this data would eliminate any ability that firms have to loan small amounts of cash at current interest rates. The result would either lead shortterm loan companies to shut down or further hurt borrowers by requiring that they borrow larger sums of money to qualify for loans. Lastly, the CFPB heralds that their redesign is prompted by a study by The Pew Charitable Trusts survey research that the vast majority of borrowers want  most products to become installment loans with smaller, manageable payments. At first glance, it seems that borrowers in need are hurting and want to find a way out of a difficult situation. Although there are those who are caught in the inability to pay back loans because they got caught in bad finance due to the risk of shortterm loans, many of those surveyed actually sent in raving reviews in support of shortterm loans. In fact, more than 98 percent of the 12,308 submissions to the Bureaus  Tell Your Story  program  where people sent in their experiences regarding shortterm loans  were positive and excessively thankful for these loans. These responses ranged from, there are no other avenues out there that can lend money like this, to a simple thank you. This study was personally conducted by the CFPB. Unsatisfied with the results, they hid it from the publics view until a Freedom of Information Act request forced them to release it. This holding back of information demonstrates that the Bureau is not truly searching to help the people it says it wants to help. Rather, they have a keen eye for policy symbolism, and the flash of fighting for the underdog when in fact they are irreversibly harming them while sticking a knife in their back. Policymakers continue the belief that shortterm loans are as bad as they seem comes either because they did not attend their economics classes in college, or they simply want to be perceived as someone who cares. But we cannot let policymakers make decisions because their hearts lead them to make uneducated proposals. We cannot let legislators sway our hearts because we hear about the extreme situations where people are hurt. Instead, we need to look at the coldhard facts the numbers that the CFPB uses to defend their arguments are manipulative and outright false. The Small Dollar Lending Rule must not be allowed to pass and the proposal must be removed and taken back  it will only hurt the people it claims it will help. Let Americans make decisions for themselves  theyre smarter and more riskaverse than Washington insiders give them credit for. Jonathan Lee is a filmmaker and freelance economics journalist.

"Levers of Power Flushing the Vote Down the Memory Hole Electronic election fraud exposed David Knight  Infowars.com  October 26, 2016 Comments Establishment politicians and press are outraged that Trump would question the integrity of their system. They say it undermines public trust in political institutions. Yet to see who is truly undermining public trust we need look no further than the people running the elections, who are shutting down election audit procedures, who stonewall and eject certified election monitors and who make any recording of malfunctioning voting machines a felony. One such person is Texas Director of Elections, Keith Ingram. This story is specific to Texas, but the same tactics are used nationwide by both parties to exploit vulnerabilities inherent in electronic voting. I went to the Texas Secretary of State offices to ask Mr. Ingram about specific procedural changes he has made in his 4 year tenure and the changes he attempted to make in August that would have gone into effect this November. With camera  mic in hand, we told the reception desk that we were with the press and would like to talk to the Director about the election. We were told to wait in the lobby and Mr. Ingram would be down. You can see for yourself what happened when he saw the mic flag showing we were with Infowars. The man running the election bureaucracy runs from questions. So much for transparency and candor. This unelected bureaucrat is tasked with ensuring that counties adhere to election law. What follows are the specific actions taken by his office that waive requirements and undermine election integrity in Texas. But before we get to specifics about his actions  his connection to the Rose Law firm in Arkansas, there are some general questions that should concern voters nationwide  Why would standards required by our elected lawmakers for election integrity be bent to the capabilities of vendors rather than require vendors to perform to the standard  Why would election procedures be waived and honesty and transparency sacrificed for the convenience of election workers  officials Burning The Paper Trail In August 2016, Ingram, Texas Director of Elections, attempted to make last minute rule changes for the upcoming November 8 election that would eliminate crucial paper backup records for electronic voting. His office issued new rules that would Eliminate printing of paper audit logs that poll watchers are entitled to monitor at main tabulation computers. Eliminate printing of Early Voting Results tapes. Eliminate printing of ballot images for recounts. Fortunately activists and some elected representatives got the proposed rule changes postponed, with a formal public hearing scheduled after the November election. State Senator Don Huffines said The states chief election officers must reconsider and redraft their proposed election rules to pursue more realtime paper records and backups, not fewerThe comfort  convenience of election administrators should not take priority over voters confidence and election integrity. But even though these procedures have been postponed, Ingrams previous rule changes are still a cause for concern in the November election and have caused repercussions in two election cases currently being litigated. Here are some of the problems 1 Waiver of laws requiring a Partial Manual Recount audit Ingram waived the requirement to conduct a manual count in 1 of the election precincts or 3 election precincts, whichever is greater. This was waived in all 254 counties the day after the March 2016 Primary. The timing is significant because during the primary there were 1,743 move votes than voters in Hill County in the Republican Primary. The margin of victory was 225 in Texas House District 8 that contains Hill County. In calling for a criminal investigation, Ingram noted that it appears 6 or 7 voters voted more than once in the election and one voter voted as many as four times. Yet he waived the partial manual recount audit requirement statewide and he has waived other audit and monitoring procedures. 2 Waiver of laws requiring printing of paper backup results tapes Ingrams waivers issued in 2014, 2015, and 2016, appear to be in direct contradiction of state election laws 65.004, 65.014, 66.022, 66.023, 66.024 and the Judges Handbook. These rules require   Three original tally lists shall be maintained at the polling place to record the number of votes received for the candidates  On completion of the vote count, the presiding judge shall prepare the returns of the election for the precinct with total number of voters, total number of votes with the presiding judge signing each of the 3 copies to certify. Ingram also issued waivers for requirements that a zero tape be printed from the machines at the beginning of election day and a tally tape printed at the close of election. His letter states that the process of printing of the zero tape and tally tape at each countywide precinct location could take hours in both the morning and the evening of election day. So expediency for election workers takes precedent over requirements enacted by the legislature for integrity of elections. And if a favored vendor cant perform to the law, the law is waived. If proper procedures had been followed to ensure that the machine was at a zero state, instead of waived by Ingram, the Hill County issue of 1,743 more voters than votes would not have happened. The vendor in Hill County, ESS eventually identified the source of the extra votes saying An audit of the log report from the central paper ballot scanner showed that the hard drive had not been properly cleared of all ballots cast before scanning Early Voting or Election Day ballotsThere are established election protocols which should be followed to prevent this type of reporting error. But the Director of Elections is waiving those established election protocols. Ingrams waver of legal requirements  his improvised solution of printing a zero tape at the county warehouse prior to election day opens the door for error and fraud. 3 Ignoring laws requiring printing of legally sufficient ballot images for recounts The Secretary of State Election Division claims that cast vote records are equivalent to ballot images. As you can see, the cast vote records are very different from ballots and are not uniquely numbered. The Texas Constitution, Article 6  Suffrage, Section 4 says In all elections by the people, the vote shall be by ballot, and the Legislature shall provide for the numbering of tickets and make such other regulations as may be necessary to detect and punish fraud and preserve the purity of the ballot box. Yet the machines by vendors Hart InterCivic and ESS, certified by Ingram, do not provide uniquely numbered ballots per state recount laws and dont provide other components of a legal Texas ballot. 4 Ignoring laws that allow poll watchers to monitor all election activities such as the printing of paper audit logs for computerized result tabultion Texas Election Code, Sec 33.056 says a watcher is entitled to observe any activity conducted at the location at which the watcher is serving. Affidavits from two official poll watchers for a candidate in Dallas County with official Poll Watcher signed forms detail how they were repeatedly obstructed from monitoring multiple election activities at the Dallas County Central Counting Station such as ballot scanning, vote transfer, ballot transfer, computer activities, ballot tabulation, and viewing the elections computer line printer. They state that they were repeatedly treated disrespectfully, obstructed and blatantly ignored by the election officials, and voting machine vendor before being thrown out after the officials spoke with the Texas Secretary of State Elections office. Hostility to election monitors, like Ingrams refusal to answer our questions, destroy the publics confidence in the honesty of the process  and rightfully so. Ingrams Connections To Arkansas, Kutak Rock, Rose Law Firm  Hillary Clinton According to a public information request of Ingrams Secretary of State personnel file, Ingram left private practice and moved to Little Rock Arkansas, taking a job with the law firm, Kutak Rock, LL. At Kutak Rock, he worked under the managing partner, Gordon Miller Wilbourn who had been a partner with Hillary Clinton, Vince Foster and Webster Hubbell at the Rose Law Firm in Arkansas in the 1990s. The Wilbourn family is a large donor to the Clinton Foundation and the Hillary Clinton campaign. Ingram left Kutak Rock to return to Texas when he was hired by Gov. Rick Perrys appointment office in 2008 to oversee statewide political appointments for various courts, boards  commissions. Ingramss career moves are interesting. In just 10 months, his journey from private practice in Texas through Arkansas Clintoncronies and back to Texas government resulted in pay cuts with each move and his salary being cut in half. In 2012, Ingram, was promoted to Director of the Election Division in the Texas Secretary of States Office where his salary was still 40 less than private practice. Ingrams determination to remove paper trails and auditing procedures for electronic voting is even more troubling when we look at his connections to big Clinton donors. Establishment Of Both Parties Dont Appear To Want Election Integrity In one lawsuit contesting election results for Austin City Council, the County could not produce ANY ballot images as required by law to conduct a recount. Computer logs had multiple corruption/invalid errors. During discovery it was learned that the computer counted more votes than registered voters in 10 of the 12 precincts forming the district. One precinct had 100 voter turnout, another was just 2 registered voters shy of 100 in spite of only 32 and 17 countywide turnout in the general and runoff elections. The County Democrat Party has financed legal opposition to the lawsuit and a Republican judge claimed there was no evidence for election irregularities. There are some positive developments, however. The Republican judge has now been voted off the bench of the solidly Republican County and state legislators have taken up the question of election integrity that has so far been ignored by Governor Abbotts office. State Senator Bob Hall said, Due to an increasing number of complaints, it is time for the Texas Elections Division Office to take immediate and decisive action to rescind all waivers issued by that officeand instruct all Texas counties using electronic voting systems to consistently adhere to all election laws Voters, regardless of political affiliation, should reject policies and personnel that compromise honest, transparent elections. For example, Chambers County in Texas recently announced electronic voting would be suspended until the glitches affecting voting machines could be corrected. Its time to remove Keith Ingram as Texas Director of Elections and replace easily hacked electronic voting machines with paper ballots.  ",conspiracy

"Kurds Worried Turkey Will Stab Them in the Back as They Fight ISIS Turkey publicly opposes ISIS while supporting them behind the scenes Image Credits Kurdish YPG fighters Kurdishstruggle . Two months after being purged from the border town of Jarablus in northern Syria by a Turkishled force  and just days after being targeted by Turkish airstrikes near alBab  Syrian Kurds now fear a stab in the back from Turkeys military as plans for a U.S.led push to clear ISIS fighters from Raqqa are carried out. It is very important Raqqa is liberated, a chief political leader of the main Syrian Kurdish party, the PYD, told Reuters . But one point which is bothering us is that, if we go toward Raqqa, we will be stabbed from the back. At the end of August, Turkish forces took part in a U.S.led operation to eject ISIS from the northern border of Syria. Once inside Syria, however, Turkish forces  leading Free Syrian Army FSA rebels  took aim at Kurdish fighters in the town of Jarablus, which sent them scurrying across the Euphrates River in retreat. The issue here is that the U.S. claims to find the Kurds useful in the fight against ISIS. The Kurds, in fact, make up a significant portion of one of the primary U.S.supplied rebel forces in the region. As Reuters explains  Kurdish militia have played a big role in the past year in the Syrian Democratic Forces SDF, a U.S.backed umbrella group, as it has seized large areas of territory from Islamic State, laying the ground for an assault on Raqqa. However, Turkeys intervention in Syria in August in support of rebel groups fighting under the Free Syrian Army FSA banner has complicated that equation, leading to clashes between them and Kurdish groups allied to the SDF. The problem is one of trust. Turkey believes the Kurdish militants are aligned with the Kurdish PYD party, which the Turks believe is allied with Kurds within Turkey whove been waging a religious insurgency for over three decades. So regardless of whether the U.S. finds the Kurds useful, Turkey has made it clear it intends to sleep with one eye open for the foreseeable future. In fact, its taking a much more proactive stance than that. Last Thursday, in a campaign of airstrikes that were the heaviest against the YPG since Turkey launched a military incursion into Syria, Turkey targeted three Kurdishcontrolled villages along the northern Syrian border. The Turkish military later confirmed it had carried out 26 strikes on areas recently taken by the Kurdish YPG militia and had killed between 160 and 200 combatants. Turkeys major concern is that Kurdishcontrolled enclaves will physically unite, thereby creating a de facto Kurdish ministate along the Turkish border. As such, Turkey has warned Kurds to keep out of towns like Manjib, which is just northeast of the heaviest fighting in Aleppo. This tangled web of strained alliances and old feuds will likely only grow more confusing as the U.S.led operation to purge ISIS from Raqqa draws nearer. In any case, Turkish President Erdogan seems to have discovered a newfound independence , and the days of him obediently  even if somewhat grudgingly  bending to the U.S. will appear to be fading, as well. From now on we will now wait for problems to come knocking on our door, we will not wait until the blade is against our bone and skin, we will not wait for terrorist organizations to come and attack us, Erdogan said from his palace last week. Let them go wherever until we find and destroy them. I am saying this very clearly they will not have a single place to find peace abroad.

"Store US Government Acknowledges That alQaeda Is Not A Priority In Syria One might ask, then if alQaeda in Syria is not a priority for the war on terror, what is Darius Shahtahmasebi  Anti Media  October 26, 2016 Comments Last week, the U.S. State Department acknowledged that alQaedalinked terror group Jabhat alNusra is not a priority for the United States efforts in Syria. One might ask, then if alQaeda in Syria is not a priority for the war on terror, what is State Department spokesman John Kirby provided some useful insight into this dilemma, stating The only thing that stands between where we are now and a permanent and enduring ceasefire in Syria is Bashar alAssad and his supporters . We recognize AlNusra as a spoiler, we have concerns about comingling, Ive talked about this ad nauseam. Largely missing from the American narrative of the Syrian conflict is that alNusra is shelling residential areas in Aleppo, where the government holds control of the majority of Aleppos citizens. In other parts of the world, these alQaedalinked extremists are seen as the enemy, whereas in Syria, Western media will often refer to them as mere rebel groups. The United States first officially used the term war on terror on September 20, 2011, to refer to the military campaigns that followed the attacks of September 11. The stated aim at the time was to defeat Islamiclinked terrorist organizations and dismantle regimes the U.S. government accused of supporting terrorism. In 2013, Obama stated   We must define our effort not as a boundless Global War on Terror, but rather as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America. The fact that a terror group  one linked to the organization that allegedly launched an act of war against the United States on American soil  is not a priority of the United States State Department should tell you something about how farcical and ineffective the war on terror actually is. This change in rhetoric, which is ultimately designed to push ulterior economic agendas in the Middle East, is an insult to the thousands of soldiers who sacrificed their lives under the false pretense that they were going to protect their families from alQaedalinked terrorists.

TO MANY WHO conduct work or research related to digital security, the legislation meant to protect against computer crimes has morphed into something harmful. The 1986 law, the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, has been repeatedly described as vague and ineffectual  allowing overzealous prosecutors to saddle hacktivists and lowlevel criminals with excessive sentences.

First Look Media, the publisher of The Intercept, is a plaintiff in the case. The Department of Justice acknowledges that laws addressing the misuse of computers have not kept pace uniformly with developments in technology and criminal schemes though it maintains that the law remains important in prosecuting cybercrimes. Some of the prosecutions under the CFAA have proved controversial.

"Obama Admin Targets Soldiers Bonuses, Lets Bad VA Employees Keep Theirs Pentagon asks troops to repay bonuses, VA rewards employees after widespread problems Morgan Chalfant  Free Beacon  October 26, 2016 Comments The federal government is trying to recoup enlistment bonuses given erroneously to thousands of California soldiers despite routinely allowing poorperforming VA employees to keep their bonus checks. The Los Angeles Times reported last week that the Pentagon demanded that thousands of California soldiers repay bonuses they were given to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Defense Department asked the soldiers to repay the bonuses, which amounted to 15,000 or more each, after audits revealed they were overpaid by the California National Guard. But the practice stands in contrast with that of the Obama administrations Department of Veterans Affairs, which has failed to take back hundreds of thousands of dollars paid to highranking bureaucrats who have been scrutinized for bad behavior or poor management. For instance, the VA said last year it would not collect over 400,000 in bonuses paid to two senior executives who manipulated the agencys hiring system to take new jobs with less responsibility and receive relocation benefits.

"California National Guard Members wont have to Pay Back Bonuses Pentagon had been seeking repayment of enlistment bonuses paid to California Guardsmen USA Today  October 26, 2016 Comments Defense Secretary Ash Carter ordered the Pentagon on Wednesday to stop clawing back excessive recruiting bonuses paid to California National Guardsmen. The move came after news broke over the weekend that the Pentagon had been seeking repayment of enlistment bonuses paid to California Guardsmen. Some of the payments were made by mistake, others were taken fraudulently. While some soldiers knew or should have known they were ineligible for benefits they were claiming, many others did not, Carter said in a statement. About 2,000 have been asked, in keeping with the law, to repay erroneous payments. As first reported by the Los Angeles Times , the Pentagon sought repayment of the excess bonuses from almost 10,000 California Guard soldiers. The paper reported that many of the soldiers affected had served multiple combat deployments and had been ordered to repay bonuses plus interest. Some had had their wages garnished and tax liens slapped on them when they refused to pay. The bonus scandal was revealed after audits showed widespread overpayments.",conspiracy
"Obamacare Architect Gruber Demands Larger Mandate Penalty Bureaucrat who said stupidity of Americans helped get law passed doubles down Paul Joseph Watson  October 26, 2016 Comments Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber  the bureaucrat who once bragged that the stupidity of the American people was crucial for passing the health care law in the first place  told CNN that the fix for Obamacare was to impose a larger mandate penalty. CNNs CAROL COSTELLO So lets talk about how exactly you can fix Obamacare. I just need you to be specific because I think people really want answers. So Hillary Clinton says she can fix Obamacare. So what would one fix that would drive premiums down JONATHAN GRUBER Look, once again, theres no sense it has to be fixed. The law is working as designed. However, it could work better. And I think, probably the most important things experts would agree on is we need a larger mandate penalty Grubers arrogance is incredible. Even after the Obama administration acknowledged that premiums are set to skyrocket next year, Gruber thinks that the answer is to financially punish Americans to an even greater degree. Gruber is essentially admitting that Obamacare is designed to make Americans destitute. ObamaCare was never designed not to overwhelm you with the shifting of massive costs. ObamaCare was designed to crush you in costs, points out the Conservative Treehouse blog . His comments shouldnt come as much of a surprise given what Gruber thinks of the American people. A series of videos that emerged in 2014 featured Gruber admitting that Obamacare was deceptively crafted in order to fool stupid Americans into not realizing that it would mean massive price hikes and that the laws lack of transparency was a huge political advantage in selling it.

"Will China Trigger the Next Global Recession Current debt level causes grave concern Jing Jin  Mises.org   Chinas debt growth rate has become the focus of some discussions and, fair enough, from comparing the outright levels, it may seem that China can collapse at any moment. Daniel Fernandez suggested this in his article  Has China Reached Its Debt Limit  in Mises Wire . In response to the governments monetary expansion stimulus plan after the 2008 financial crisis, Chinas corporate sector did indeed leverage up quickly, followed by an equally fast pace of leveraging in the household sector. However, in order to avoid comparing apples with oranges, we need to take a closer look by putting these numbers into perspective. Using the same data source as used by Fernandez, we find that Chinas total debt as a percentage of GDP was 254 percent by the end of 2015. DebttoGDP ratio of corporate, government, and household sectors stood at 170 percent, 44 percent, and 40 percent respectively. For government and household sectors, both started from considerably low levels until the last administration kicked in a fourtrillion yuan RMB stimulus plan in 2009. Government debttoGDP ratio, which was kept in the mid 30s in the first decade of this millennium, now stood at 44 percent by the end of 2015. Households debttoGDP ratio was at 11 percent in 2006 and almost doubled to 19 percent in 2007 and then doubled again to 40 percent by the end of 2015. The leveraging up of households happened exactly as the Chinese society was undergoing rapid urbanization as well as when the government launched its 2009 stimulus. Apart from the demand for urban housing, Chinese households, with their high savings rate and extra cash in hands, invested in in real estate as a hedge against future inflation. Furthermore, as the stimulus package allowed for easier lending, household debt increased dramatically. However, we must note that although the debt growth rate was high, the absolute debt level of household is still considerably low versus global peers. The most disturbing trend is found in the corporate sector, with the debttoGDP ratio increased from approximately 110 percent prior to 2009 to 170 percent by the end of 2015. First of all, the level of corporate debt mostly in the form of bank loans was high to start with, but is by no means out of the norm for a financial system dominated by the banking sector, whose funding source is mostly deposits. Two figures from Jonathan Andersons How To Think About China series provide some insights 1 An international comparison of assets of banking system vs. domestic saving rate Breakdown of assets of Chinas financial system This point can be further demonstrated by comparing financial asset structures, for example, between the US and China. Obviously bank loans are the dominant funding source of the corporate sector in China, whereas in the US the role of bank loans is far from prominent in comparison with its enormous capital markets, where the corporates can raise both equities and bond financing easily. Financial asset structure US vs. China 2015 Data source The World Bank, Federal Reserve Bank, Shanghai Stock Exchange, Shenzhen Stock Exchange, China Central Deposit and Clearing, Co. Ltd. CCDC, SIFMA It is, therefore, not surprising that the leveraging up as a response to governments stimulus plan manifested itself mostly in the credit extension through the banking system. Chinas Flat Yield Curve The large role of the banks can also be seen in Chinas bond market yields, and one manifestation of this is a flat yield curve . The reason for this is simple deposits. When banks have more deposits to manage than they can lend out, they invest these deposits into the bond market and usually on the long end to boost yields. This investment strategy or assetliability management scheme bids up the bond prices on the long end, hence pushing down the longterm yields. In addition, between allocating deposits to these two types of assets bonds vs. loans, banks sometimes have incentives to invest in bonds, rather than lending, due to the balancing considerations of corporate demand, credit risks, market liquidity, and yields that are also subject to interest rate controls that are at final stage of liberalization and the lending rate was completely liberalized only in early 2016. So the yield spread, at current stage, reflects more of the combination of Chinas financial structure and capital flows rather than being a good indicator of economic fundamentals. As the government flooded the market with four trillion RMB from the stimulus plan in 2009, bond yields faced downward pressure, more so at the longterm end. Please see the yields of Chinese government treasury bonds at maturity 10 years vs. 1 year and the spread thereof in the below figure. Wealth management products channel a considerable amount of deposits out of the banking system to capture higher yields outside of bankingsector supervision in form of trusts, for example, but the amount is still not pivotal enough to change the above explained pattern in a fundamental manner. Data source WIND, CCDC China didnt open up to the outside world until the very late 1970s. Now China provides half of the manufacturing goods and close to half of electronic products in the world and the economy is still growing at around 6 percent. Obviously a good part of Chinas production structure has been configured to export, mostly to the developed economies, which are dominated by the service sector. As the global demand in the developed economies lost its momentum, China faces the necessity of reconfiguring its economic structure to better serve its domestic consumers which stands at 4 times the number of US consumers. This reconfiguration process is surely painful as demonstrated by the empty factories in the traditional export production oriented cities. But to me, this is more of a textbook case of Austrian economics at work. Capital and labor have to be freed up for those productions currently being demanded by the market. And this takes time. Moreover, quick capital formation in the past three decades lifted labor productivity, with which the manufacturing sector needs to be upgraded and the tertiary sector needs to be expanded to serve a more affluent society comparing with more than 30 years ago, so that Chinese consumers dont have to go to Japan to buy hitech toilet lids . A Healthier Skepticism of Stimulus Needless to say, the current debt level causes concern and the deeper concern is whether debt growth trajectory will continue. Ultimately, whether or not the debt will grow at the rate of post 2008 stimulus phase is a function of how fast the Chinese government runs the money printing press. A recent article on the Peoples Daily  the mouthpiece of China Communist Party CCP  quoted the diagnosis from an authoritative figure on the Chinese economy and its cure. This authoritative figure suggested there should be no more money printing to stimulate the economy and that the Chinese should be prepared for a lower growth rate comparing with its own historical average of 10 percent. Anyone with an understanding of Chinas political messaging system would not be mistake it for anything but an opinion handed down from the very top of Chinese leadership. This can be considered a concluding remark on the policy swings for the past several years. The Xinhua News Agency, the mainstream media group, recently followed with a commentary suggesting resistance to the use of stimulus plans in the face of slowing growth. Xinhua also warned of a disastrous result if its advice is not followed. Messages like these are refreshing to hear nowadays among the mantra of the stimulus chorus around the world. How Chinas policy direction is to be implemented remains to be seen, but at least the insidious effects of stimulus is well recognized by those at the top of the regime and openly represented by mainstream media. In addition, a series of measures to lower tax burdens for corporate and households alike are also being introduced, and the central government is pushing hard for businessfriendly deregulations and increasing economic freedom. China has its problems tons of them. China may or may not be the first to blow up in the coming wave of crises, as many people say. No matter whichever the case, I am more convinced that China will be among the first ones to revive  because it has high savings to invest, it has a welltrained labor force with one of the most vibrant, if not the most complete, manufacturing chain, and the manufacturing sector still contributes to over 40 percent of its GDP. It is still in the middle of a rapid urbanization process. It is not yet a welfare state. Chinese people are fully aware of the fact that their safety net is the result of their own frugality rather than government promises. China has the biggest potential market of 1.3 billion people with a rising middleclass that is still increasing in numbers and share in population. Serving them well is one of the biggest business opportunities in the 21st century. Jing Jin is Associate Dean at the China Economics and Management Academy in Beijing.

"Get Ready For Civil Unrest Survey Finds That Most Americans Are Concerned About Election Violence Time is rapidly slipping away and November 8th will be here before we know it Michael Snyder  Economic Collapse  October 27, 2016 Comments Could we see violence no matter who wins on November 8th Lets hope that it doesnt happen, but as you will see below, antiTrump violence is already sweeping the nation. If Trump were to actually win the election, that would likely send the radical left into a violent postelection temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before. Alternatively, there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by Hillary Clinton. And as I showed yesterday, it appears that voting machines in Texas are already switching votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . If Hillary Clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances, that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country. At this moment there is less than two weeks to go until November 8th, and a brand new survey has found that a majority of Americans are concerned about the possibility of violence on election day A 51 majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day one in five are very concerned. Three of four say they have confidence that the United States will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked American democracy for more than 200 years, but just 40 say they are very confident about that. More than four in 10 of Trump supporters say they wont recognize the legitimacy of Clinton as president, if she prevails, because they say she wouldnt have won fair and square. But many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence. On Wednesday, Donald Trumps star on the Walk of Fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pickax Donald Trump took a lot of hits today, and not just in the Presidential race. With less than two weeks to go before America decides if the ex Apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over Hillary Clinton, Trumps star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was destroyed early Wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pickax in what looks to be a Tinseltown first. And there were two other instances earlier this year when Donald Trumps star was also vandalized. One came in January, and the other happened in June  This is of course not the first time the GOP candidates star has been attacked or defaced since Trump announced his White House bid in summer 2015. The most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at 6801 Hollywood Blvd in late January. In June this summer, a mute sign was painted on Trumps star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused Trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign. In both cases, Trumps star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day. We have seen antiTrump violence on the east coast as well. Earlier this month, someone decided to firebomb the Republican Party headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina. On the building next to the headquarters, someone spraypainted Nazi Republicans get out of town or else along with a swastika. There have also been other disturbing incidents of antiTrump violence all over the nation in recent days. A recent Lifezette article put together quite a long list, and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece On Oct. 15 in Bangor, Maine, vandals spraypainted about 20 parked cars outside a Trump rally. Trump supporter Paul Foster, whose van was hit with white paint, told reporters, Why cant they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars, all of this, to make their statement Around Oct. 3, a couple of Trump supporters were assaulted in Zeitgeist, a San Francisco bar, after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Trump, GotNews reports. The two Trump supporters were attacked, punched, and chased into the street by some thugs that a barmaid called out from the back. Lilian Kim of ABC 7 Bay Area tweeted a photo of the men, in which one was wearing a Trump Tshirt and the other was wearing a Blue Lives Matter shirt. On Sept. 28 in El Cajon, California, an angry mob at a Black Lives Matter protest beat 21yearold Trump supporter Feras Jabro for wearing a Make America Great Again baseball cap. The assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app Periscope. There is a move to get Trump supporters to wear red on election day, but in many parts of America that might just turn his supporters into easy targets. Lets certainly hope that we dont see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating. Of course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad, and a Hillary Clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge. For example, this week former Congressman Joe Walsh said that he is grabbing my musket if Donald Trump loses the election Former Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. Walsh, a former tea party congressman from Illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host, tweeted, On November 8th, Im voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, Im grabbing my musket. You in And without a doubt, many ordinary Americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case Hillary Clinton is victorious. The following comes from USA Today  Since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards Hillary Clinton, Ive been buying a lot more ammunition, says Rick Darling, 69, an engineer from Harrison Township, in Michigans Detroit suburbs. In a followup phone interview after being surveyed, the Trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to declare martial law and take our guns away after the election. Today America is more divided than I have ever seen it before, and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another. Ironically, Donald Trump has been working very hard to bring America together. In fact, he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any Republican presidential candidate since 1960 . If Hillary Clinton and the Democrats win on November 8th, things will not go well for Hillary Clintons political enemies. The Clintons used the power of the White House to go after their enemies the first time around, and Hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then. And the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are. This is something that I discussed on national television earlier this month  As I write this, it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a Hillary Clinton presidency would be. But at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome . Out of all the candidates that we could have chosen, the American people are about to put the most evil one by far into the White House. Perhaps Donald Trump can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate, but time is rapidly slipping away and November 8th will be here before we know it. NEWSLETTER SIGN UP  ",conspiracy

Her brother was a police officer in the unit that was the basis for the television show The Wire and is now a law student, and she is related by marriage to Congressman and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. Earlier this month, Ryan said that he would no longer defend or campaign for Donald Trump. A poll released this week found that nearly two thirds of Republicans trust Donald Trump more than Ryan to lead the GOP. Many Trump supporters speculated that Ryan was involved in the leaking of the infamous Billy Bush tape, in which Trump made lewd comments about women, as part of a plot to sabotage the Republican nominees campaign. Could the fact that one of his relatives is being touted as a likely Clinton Supreme Court pick be another reason as to why Ryan  who has been accused by many of being in bed with the Washington establishment  has abandoned his support for Donald Trump SUBSCRIBE on YouTube",conspiracy
"Video Rude CNN Reporter Asks Trump Why Hes Taking Time Off To Open A Hotel Meanwhile Hillary Clinton is at home sleeping Steve Watson  Infowars.com   GOP nominee Donald Trump took time out of a relentless campaign schedule Wednesday to spend around an hour opening a new hotel, prompting one CNN reporter to accuse Trump of taking time out of swing states. Meanwhile Hillary Clinton is again nowhere to be seen. CNNs Dana Bash suggested that Trump should be more concerned with campaigning in swing states, yet Trump had three campaign stops scheduled for the same day. Dana Bash Is your DC hotel opening free advertisingDonald Trump No, not at all https//t.co/6OZtrfIwim https//t.co/9HHqooom8r  CNN Politics @CNNPolitics October 26, 2016 So to people who say youre taking time out of swing states to go do this, you say Bash asked. I say the following You have been covering me for the last  long time. I did yesterday eight stops and three major speeches, and Ive been doing this for weeks straight, Trump responded. For you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps. And yet youll ask me that question. I think thats a very rude question, to be honest with you. Trump exclaimed. Trump added that the opening of the hotel also served to prove a point that he can get things built under budget and ahead of schedule, suggesting that the country needs to be able to follow suit. While CNN has continuously run defense for Hillary Clinton amid a myriad of scandals, and even rigged its own polls to suggest she won the debates, the network has been forced to admit that Hillary is running an extremely light campaign schedule. Last month, for example, Hillary went six days without an event except for a short speech she gave in Orlando, Florida. And in August, Hillary took seven of the first 14 days of the month off and even went four days without a single campaign appearance. Her speeches are so short  they dont last long, theyre like 10 minutes and lets get out of here, Donald Trump said about her schedule. Go back home and go to sleep.

"Trump Warns Of Vote Flipping On Machines People are not happy. BIG lines.

A lot of callins about vote flipping at the voting booths in Texas, Trump tweeted. People are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on A lot of callins about vote flipping at the voting booths in Texas. People are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on  Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump October 27, 2016 As Infowars has highlighted , there have already been numerous reports of early voters in Texas seeing their ballots flipped from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. While election officials have dismissed the reports, suggesting user error is to blame, tech experts have long warned that the machines can become less accurate over time. Larry Norden, a voting technology expert, told NPR that the reports usually arise where outdated technology is being employed. Over time, as people vote, that calibration becomes less and less accurate, Norden noted. During elections over the past decade and more there have been reports of voting machines flipping. Indeed, the reports were so widespread that even entertainment shows such as The Simpsons drew attention to it Meanwhile, The Washington Post has admitted that the press is engaging in voter suppression, bizarrely claiming it is a legitimate way of countering Trumps rigged election claims. Callum Borchers, author at the Washington Post blog The Fix writes Since the final presidential debate last week, many news outlets have been delivering an unvarnished message to Donald Trump supporters Your candidate is virtually certain to lose the election Nov. 8. A day later, the Timess Upshot blog increased Clintons chances of winning to 93 percent , an alltime high. On Monday, Politicos Ben Schreckinger wrote that  Donald Trumps path to an election night win is almost entirely closed . Here at The Fix, Chris Cillizza and Aaron Blake wrote that  Donald Trumps chances of winning are approaching zero . These are accurate, statistically sound statements. But they are something else, too. Declarations that Trump is highly unlikely to win also serve as counters to the Republican nominees warning that the rigged election could be  stolen from us . The latest polls, which Trump insists are rigged due to oversampling, show Clinton with a double digit lead. However, Hillary Clintons campaign manager Robby Mook has warned that Trumps suggestions that the polls are wrong and he can still win are absolutely right. Weve seen polls tighten since the third debate and we expect things to get even closer before Election Day. Mook said, urging Clinton supporters to vote. Make no mistake. With only 10 percent of votes cast, Donald Trump could win this election, Mook said. NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news  specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew.

"Store Exclusive Christs Burial Place Exposed for First Time in Centuries Restorers working in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Israel uncover stone slab venerated as the resting place of Jesus Christ Image Credits Wiki Commons . For the first time in centuries, scientists have exposed the original surface of what is traditionally considered the tomb of Jesus Christ. Located in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Old City of Jerusalem, the tomb has been covered by marble cladding since at least 1555 A.D., and most likely centuries earlier. The marble covering of the tomb has been pulled back, and we were surprised by the amount of fill material beneath it, said Fredrik Hiebert, archaeologistinresidence at the National Geographic Society, a partner in the restoration project. It will be a long scientific analysis, but we will finally be able to see the original rock surface on which, according to tradition, the body of Christ was laid. According to Christian tradition, the body of Jesus Christ was laid on a shelf or burial bed hewn from the side of a limestone cave following his crucifixion by the Romans in A.D. 30 or possibly 33. Christian belief says Christ was resurrected after death, and women who came to anoint his body three days after the burial reported that no remains were present.",conspiracy
"Three Quarters Of Americans Oppose Gun Control Record numbers say no to proposed handgun ban Steve Watson  Infowars.com  October 27, 2016 Comments A new poll released by Gallup has found that a record amount of Americans are opposed to gun control measures . The survey found that 76 percent of respondents, over three quarters, believe that a ban on civilian ownership of handguns should not be made law. The findings represent a fourpoint increase on the same survey from last year, in addition to an alltime high for the past three decades. The poll also found that almost two thirds, 61 percent, are against a ban on semiautomatic rifles, or assault weaponsas the corporate media refers to them. That figure represents a full tenpoint increase on previous findings, and is an all time record high since polling began on the issue 20 years ago. Just 27 percent, less than a third, say they support a ban on handgun ownership, while only 36 percent, support a semiautomatic ban. an eightpoint decline on previous findings. In addition, gun sales have been hitting record highs for months on end. In a summary of the new poll, Gallup seemed surprised, by the findings, describing waning support for a gun ban as a paradox Perhaps paradoxically, opposition toward a ban has increased against a backdrop of multiple mass shootings and terrorist attacks in which the perpetrators used assault rifles. These guns were used in highprofile incidents, including the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, California, and Orlando, and the mass shootings in Aurora, Colorado, and Newtown, Connecticut. The findings reveal just how out of step Hillary Clintons position on gun control is with the majority of Americans. Hillary is a staunch gun control proponent. Wikileaks releases have revealed that Hillary plans to implement strict gun control measures by executive order. Clinton purportedly plans to open gun manufacturers to lawsuits by crime victims, a move that critics say would do nothing to reduce crime, but would bankruptand eventually endgun manufacturing in the United States.

"Wikileaks Email Clinton Operative Thinks Black Voters Are Stupid David Brock accused of elitist racism Paul Joseph Watson  October 27, 2016 Comments A new email released as part of the Wikileaks Podesta dump features Clinton ally Brent Budowsky accusing Hillary operative David Brock of having a plan that relied upon black voters being stupid. The email , sent to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and another Clinton ally CEO Roy Spence, centers around a discussion of a Bernie Sanders campaign ad which featured many black faces. Back in January, Clinton operative David Brock caused consternation within the campaign when he publicly claimed that Bernie Sanders didnt care about black people. Budowsky is not impressed with Brocks outburst, writing in the email, Brock makes the cardinal mistake of those who bring politics into disrepute with voters. He tells a lie that people will know is a lie, and insults the intelligence of black voters with a kind of elitist racism that Bill and Hillary Clinton should not be seen with. I guess Brocks plan is that black voters are stupid and will not watch the ad and believe his lie, writes Budowsky. I cannot think of anything more desperate, more stupid and more selfdestructive than David Brock lying about the Bernie ad and playing a seamy brand of the politics of race using the tactic of deceit on her behalf, adds the The Hill and Huffington Post columnist, before offering to write a campaign ad for HIllary to counter the Bernie Sanders ad. The email once again underscores the Clinton camps paranoia about not being able to authentically connect with AfricanAmerican voters in a way that Bernie Sanders could. Some black voters have been reluctant to support Clinton as a result of her support for a 1994 crime bill that resulted in the mass incarceration of young black Americans, whom Hilary referred to at the time as super predators.

"Chinese University Sells HIV Testing Kits in Vending Machine China has a 43 yearoveryear increase of the disease Image Credits David Pursehouse/Flickr . China has experienced such a growth rate of HIV in the past several years that one university has taken steps to allow students to test themselves by placing an HIV testing kit in a vending machine next to regular fare like snacks. China has seen a 43 yearoveryear increase in infection rates, which likely prompted Southwest Petroleum University in Nanchong City in Sichuan Province to install the test kits . Sichuan Province is one of the top three provinces in China with a disproportionately high rate of HIV/AIDS. Together, with the other two provinces that have high rates of the disease, the three account for over half of the cases of HIV/AIDS in the entire country. 80 of new HIV cases occur due to homosexual activity. The kits retail for 4.40 and can be taken as a urine test to determine whether or not students need to seek medical attention. Those who purchase the test will collect their urine and send it to a laboratory, and then access the results online. This can all be done completely anonymously. Similar kits can be purchased online, but they retail for around 45. The cheaper vending machine tests are just as accurate and are partially subsidized by a charity to allow the test to be more accessible. Reports state that the Chinese have limited sex education and very little is discussed about HIV or AIDS. Many students who suspect they may have the disease do not seek medical help because of its link to homosexuality. Those who do have HIV are often thought to be pariahs by their families and friends because of its connection with samesex encounters. The disease is mostly spreading amongst young homosexual men, but as with anywhere else, women who do not use proper protection are also susceptible to becoming infected. Doctors have stated that most young people who have become infected with HIV/AIDS in China lacked proper education and did not take appropriate precautions for prevention. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS UNAIDS states that there are currently about half a million people in China living with HIV or AIDS, however this figure may be inaccurate due to underreporting.

"Public Faith in Elections Falls as the State Grows Outofcontrol state power Ryan McMaken  Mises.org  October 27, 2016 Comments In the wake of the final presidential election debate last week, the mainstream media was appalled that Donald Trump would not preemptively agree to not contest the outcome of the election . Trumps position reflects a growing faction of Americans who doubt the integrity and honesty of the American electoral system. In response, mainstream media sources have responded by vehemently insisting that rigged elections are  a myth . While rarely stated explicitly, the way American electoral politics is supposed to work is this the population spends several months listening to the candidates accuse each other of terrible crimes, horrible ideas, and gross incompetence. Each candidate lists the ways he or she will use the power of government to force the winners policy preferences on the losers. Then, once the votes are cast, everyone is supposed to quickly accept the results, ignore everything that was said during the campaign, and immediately accept the winner as having an indisputable mandate to rule over everyone, including the sizable minority  or even the majority, in many cases  who either voted against the winner, or abstained. If there appears to be any irregularities in the vote, well, those should just be ignored because it would tear the country apart to drag out the election. If half the country feels its been cheated, well, tough luck and better luck next time. Democracy Breaks Down As Perceived Interventionism Increases This model can only work indefinitely under certain specific conditions. It can be workable when there is a perception that government is limited in its power, and extensive or abrupt change to government institutions are thought to be rare. It can also work in a small, culturally uniform society where there is a relatively small divide between socioeconomic and ethnic groups. In the case of the United States, however, it appears that neither of these conditions apply. In the age of presidential executive orders, militarized police, uncountable federal laws, and a myriad of spy agencies empowered to watch Americans every move, gone is the perception that a loss in an electoral contest should simply be accepted without question. The president says he can issue laws with  a pen and  a phone  without any need to consult Congress. The Libya war proved presidents can invade any country without so much as a debate in Congress. Meanwhile, the untouchable Supreme Court hands down decisions that are equivalent to Constitutional amendments, some of which can have enormous effects on the daily lives of ordinary citizens. In other words, the stakes are now reaching the point where an attitude of better luck next time doesnt cut it. Whether or not these fears are at times overstated is irrelevant. The fact is the perception of democratic lawlessness is growing. This situation is further complicated by the fact that the United States is an enormous conglomeration of different cultural and socioeconomic groups spread out over a vast and varied geography. Many of these different groups distrust each other, and in a country where the president and the judiciary now rule largely by proclamation, there is reason to be fearful when the other guys candidate wins and yours loses. Democracy Can Work When the Stakes Are Low Contrary to the naive musings of some nostalgic conservatives, the United States was never united into a single cultural, linguistic, or socioeconomic group. Those differences may have reached a low point during the twentieth century, but they were far larger in the 19th century than they are today. When you have a diverse population, however, the problem of who controls the government becomes far more important, and this concern grows as the state becomes more powerful. Writing on the topic of immigration and nationalism in Australia , Ludwig von Mises noted how powerful states exacerbate the problem of cultural divides. Could a laissezfaire regime be guaranteed to all residents of Australia, Mises notes, it would not matter at all if there were cultural mistrust between Englishdescended Australians and Asian newcomers. However, since laissezfaire liberalism has not been embraced, a familiar problem presented itself The present inhabitants of Australia fear that some day they could be reduced to a minority in their own country and that they would then have to suffer all the horrors of national persecution to which, for instance, the Germans are today i.e., the early 1920s exposed in Czechoslovakia, Italy, and Poland. It cannot be denied that these fears are justified. Because of the enormous power that today stands at the command of the state, a national minority must expect the worst from a majority of a different nationality. As long as the state is granted the vast powers which it has today and which public opinion considers to be its right, the thought of having to live in a state whose government is in the hands of members of a foreign nationality is positively terrifying. It is frightful to live in a state in which at every turn one is exposed to persecution  masquerading under the guise of justice  by a ruling majority. It is dreadful to be handicapped even as a child in school on account of ones nationality and to be in the wrong before every judicial and administrative authority because one belongs to a national minority It is clear that no solution of the problem of immigration is possible if one adheres to the ideal of the interventionist state, which meddles in every field of human activity, or to that of the socialist state. Only the adoption of the liberal program could make the problem of immigration, which today seems insoluble, completely disappear. In an Australia governed according to liberal principles, what difficulties could arise from the fact that in some parts of the continent Japanese and in other parts Englishmen were in the majority These same principles can be applied outside the subject of immigration as well. The existence of an interventionist state means any country composed of diverse ethnic and socioeconomic groups faces the same problem of one group being exploited by another group, with the help of state power. Change the term nationality to political party or interest groups, and one has a fair approximation of the problem of democracy in any interventionist state. In the presence of a relatively weak government, however, these concerns are often overstated. At the turn of the 20th century in the US, for example, the fact that Spanishspeakers were in the majority in New Mexico and many areas of the American West was irrelevant to the lives of the vast majority of Americans. The fact that Japanese immigrants and their descendant were outcompeting white businessmen in California was simply not a matter of national importance. The fact that Oregon attempted to outlaw Catholic Schools was not a matter for presidential executive orders. Thanks to widespread suspicion of federal power at the time, the lack of a strong federal judiciary and a relatively weak presidency meant these issues remained largely local while public policy was haphazard. Voters have always feared losses in elections, but now more than ever, the voters may be justified in refusing to simply accept the outcomes of elections under an interventionist state, which meddles in every field of human activity. When that is the case, elections are not something to be taken lightly. Trumps remarks about rigged elections  and public fears over the outcome  are to be expected from voters with an immense fear of outofcontrol state power. In response to all of this, the pundits and government class will tell us that everyone must double down on democracy, and that elections  specifically federal ones are sacred rituals never to be questioned. There will be a double standard, of course. A Trump victory will be questioned by the media and powerful politicians. But, in that case it will be the fault of the Russians , and not anything wrong with the system itself. The solution for the feds, of course, will be a federal takeover of the election system. If Clinton wins, then no questioning of the system will be tolerated at all. To question the outcome or the wisdom of these presidential contests will be denounced as scarcely less than sacrilege. The true solution to the problem remains far more practical, however. To paraphrase Mises, it is clear that no solution of the problem of elections is possible if one adheres to the ideal of the interventionist state. So long as elections are increasingly perceived to be referenda on which side shall use the power of the state to crush the other side, faith in the electoral system will erode, and the potential for real violence will increase.

"WHO Cancer Agency Under Fire for withholding carcinogenic glyphosate Documents IARC urged its scientists not to publish research documents on its 2015 weedkiller glyphosate review RT.com  October 27, 2016 Comments The International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC, facing criticism over its classification of carcinogens, has reportedly been advising its scientific experts not to publish internal research data on its 2015 report on probably carcinogenic glyphosate. The IARC urged its scientists not to publish research documents on its 2015 weedkiller glyphosate review, according to Reuters. The agency told Reuters on Tuesday that it tried to protect the study from external interference, as well as protect its intellectual rights, since it was the sole owner of such materials. The scientists had been asked earlier to release all the documentation on the 2015 report under US freedom of information laws. The groundbreaking review, published in March 2015 by the IARC  a semiautonomous agency of the World Health Organization WHO  labeled the glyphosate herbicide as probably carcinogenic to humans. Glyphosate is a key ingredient of Monsantos flagship weedkiller wellknown under the trade name Roundup. It is one of the most heavily used herbicides in the world and is designed to go along with geneticallymodified Roundup Ready crops, also produced by Monsanto. The IARCs report caused problems for both the notorious agrochemical giant and the agency itself. The report sparked a heated debate around the use of Roundup, and caused several EU countries  including France, Sweden, and the Netherlands  to object to the renewal of the glyphosates EU license. The vote on prolonging the glyphosate license for 15 years failed several times in June 2016, but the license was temporarily extended for 18 months during last hours before its expiration. The controversial report has seemingly made the IARC a target for attacks from multiple directions, and raised scientific, legal, and financial questions. Various critics, including those in the chemical industry, said the IARCs evaluations are fuel for unnecessary health scares, since the IARC allegedly studies the potentially harmful substance itself, and not a typical human exposure to it. It remained unclear whether the critics urged a WHO body to test the potentially carcinogenic chemical on humans. The critics also brought up other controversial statements from the IARC, over whether such things as mobile phones, coffee, red meat, and processed meat could cause cancer. The agency defended its methods as scientifically sound and widely respected for their scientific rigor, standardized and transparent process andfreedom from conflicts of interest. Numerous freedom of information requests by the Energy  Environment Legal Institute EE Legal, a US conservative advocacy group, have since been turned down with this reasoning. EE Legal told Reuters that it is pushing a legal challenge over whether the documents in question belong to the IARC or to the US federal and state institutions where some of the experts work. Basically, its being decided whether the IARC, as part of the WHO, is truly independent and free from conflicts of interest. According to Reuters, officials from the US National Institutes of Health NIH will be questioned by a congressional committee about why American taxpayers fund the cancer agency, which faces much criticism over its allegedly faulty classification of carcinogens. IARCs standards and determinations for classifying substances as carcinogenic, and therefore cancercausing, appear inconsistent with other scientific research, and have generated much controversy and alarm, a letter from US Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz to NIH director Francis Collins states, as quoted by Reuters. The Oversight Committee demanded a full disclosure of NIH funding of the IARC, and even money spent in relation to the cancer agencys activities. IARC opponents from scientific circles vowed to provide their data on the matter. The European Food Safety Authority EFSA, which believes glyphosate is unlikely pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans, promised to release its raw data on the subject as part of its commitment to open risk assessment. The food safety watchdog made this statement in late September, and still has to deliver the promised information.

The research also confirms that Gatan Dugas, a FrenchCanadian flight attendant, was not the first person in the US to be infected, despite being dubbed Patient zero in a study of gay men with Aids in 1984.

"Vitamin D Deficiency, Dirty Air Doubles Your Risk of Dementia 1 in 4 Americans will struggle with Alzheimers by 2050 Image Credits geralt/Pixabay . Dementia is one of the most common and debilitating illnesses that older Americans face today. However, recent studies have suggested that air pollution may be one of the top causes for the contribution of the diseases growth. By 2050, 1 in 4 Americans will suffer from Alzheimers. Alzheimers is the most potent form of dementia, and often ends in the patient unable to remember how to do daily and necessary tasks like eating or using the restroom. This will rival the current diabetes and obesity crises seen today. Recent studies have confirmed that a variety of environmental factors are at play when it comes to dementia. Doctors have noted that those who are deficient in vitamin D are 125 more likely to develop dementia than those who get in the necessary amount. A vitamin D deficiency can also be associated with brittle or soft bones as well as depression. It is recommended that everyone gets at least 10 minutes of sunlight per day in order to ensure they have enough vitamin D, as well as eat fortified dairy products or salmon, liver and red meat. Vitamin D can also be obtained through supplementation or fish oil. However, doctors have found that the biggest environmental risk for dementia lies in air pollution. In fact, the problem is so great that those who live in a city with high pollution can double their risk of develop dementia within 1 or 2 months living there. Recent studies have also shown that postmortem examinations of the brains of those who have lived in highly polluted areas contain traces of magnetite. This chemical compound may be partially responsible for the memory impairments associated with dementia. The risk of developing dementia if you are exposed to air pollution increases exponentially if you are obese. Researchers say that those concerned about the epidemic can combat it by living somewhere with as little pollution as possible, maintaining a health intake of vitamin D and exercising. According to research, exercise is imperitive when it comes to staving off the illness. Dr. Laura Baker, who ran a study on dementia and exercise stated These findings are important because they strongly suggest a potent lifestyle intervention such as aerobic exercise can impact Alzheimersrelated changes in the brain. No currently approved medication can rival these effects. NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news  specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew. Related Articles",conspiracy

Alas, the media, whose collusion with the Clinton campaign is laid out in many of the emails, will not have a bar of reporting them in a professional, ethical fashion.

"Assange claims crazed Clinton campaign tried to hack WikiLeaks The whistleblowing website has been releasing emails from Clintons campaign chair RT  October 27, 2016 Comments Julian Assange has claimed the Hillary Clinton campaign has attacked the servers being used by WikiLeaks. Despite the Ecuadorian embassy shutting down his internet until the US election is over, the website will continue publishing, according to Assange. Everyday that you publish is a day that you have the initiative in the conflict, Assange said via telephone at a conference in Argentina on Wednesday. The whistleblowing website has been releasing emails from Clintons campaign chair, John Podesta, on a daily basis since early October. Assange claimed the release whipped up a crazed hornets nest atmosphere in the Hillary Clinton campaign leading them to attack WikiLeaks.  They attacked our servers and attempted hacking attacks and there is an amazing ongoing campaign where state documents were put in the UN and British courts to accuse me of being both a Russian spy and a pedophile, he added. Ecuadors decision to shut down his internet was described by Assange as a strategic position so that its policy of nonintervention cant be misinterpreted by actors in the US and even domestically in Ecuador. He said he was sympathetic with Ecuador, insisting they face the dilemma of having the US interfere with their elections next year if they appear to interfere with the US elections next month. Assange, who claimed the embassy will be without internet until the election is over to avoid accusations of interference, said he did not agree with Ecuadors decision but did understand it. WikiLeaks will not be affected by the decision as they do not publish from Ecuador, he said. He did, however, reject the idea that WikiLeaks is interfering with the US election, claiming, this is not the interference of electoral process, this is the definition of electoral process  for media organizations and, in fact, everyone to publish the truth and their opinion about what is occurring. It cannot be a free and informed election unless people are free to inform. He also attacked US TV networks, many of whom he accused of being controlled by Clinton supporters. The Podesta emails will make no difference to the election result, according to Assange. I dont think theres any chance of Donald Trump winning the election, even with the amazing material we are publishing, because most of the media organizations are strongly aligned with Hillary Clinton, he said. Assange said journalists and people who work in the media are predominantly middle class and view Trump as representing what in their mind is white trash.

"Exclusive Dem Senators Private Email Hacked DCLeaks obtains emails of Colorado Democratic Senator Andy Kerr Mikael Thalen  October 27, 2016 Comments Infowars has exclusively learned that the email account of Colorado Democratic Senator Andy Kerr has been hacked. The emails, shown to Infowars by the website DCLeaks, include hundreds of discussions from March 2015 to July 2016  with one email concerning 2015 marijuana legislation oddly claiming to be from December of 2000. Taken from Kerrs Gmail account, the emails, which are currently password protected, mostly surround requests and comments by Kerrs constituents on a wide range of political topics. Speaking with Infowars, David Pourshoushtari, communications director for the Colorado State Senate Democrats, said Kerr was unaware of the hack but that the senator declined to provide an official statement until the situation could be assessed. While the exact reasoning behind the hack is currently unknown, Kerr may have been targeted as part of the same hacking campaign that compromised the emails of other political figures including Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta. It is also unclear whether Kerr, like Podesta, fell victim to a phishing attack that would have resulted in the senator putting his email password into a fake Google login page. Earlier this month the former Chief of Protocol of the United States, Capricia Marshall, who was one of Clintons insiders at the State Department, similarly had her emails appear on DCLeaks. The website also made headlines in August after publishing hundreds of documents connected to billionaire donor George Soros. According to the U.S. government and many in the cybersecurity community , Russian state hackers are responsible for the recent spate of election season hacks. DCLeaks has similarly been accused of being a publishing front for the Russian government. NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news  specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew.

"ABC Poll Oversamples Dems by 9, Claims Hillary Leading Mainstream media oversampling Democrats to create fake Hillary lead Kit Daniels  October 27, 2016 Comments In another example of poll rigging, an ABC presidential poll surveyed 9 more Democrats than Republicans and showed Hillary Clinton leading by 12  with a 3 sampling error ABC claims its a 12point race with Clinton ahead after polling a random national sample of 1,155 likely voters, but the polls methodology reveals the poll was heavily biased in favor of Hillary. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3 points, including the design effect. Partisan divisions are 362731 percent, DemocratsRepublicansindependents, ABC said near the bottom of the poll. Of course Hillary will be ahead in polls dominated by Democrats, but ABC and other mainstream media outlets are betting that voters wont bother to look at a polls methodology to find the bias. Even if theres more registered Democrats than Republicans nationally, they dont outnumber them by nearly 10 because otherwise Republicans wouldnt be winning national races. These kind of misleading polls really strike at their credibility as pollsters, wrote media analyst Aaron Rossiter. They seem to want the big Hillary lead, probably to throw off the poll averages and suppress Republican voter turnout. And if the fact that mainstream polls are adjusted to manufacture a Hillary lead still sounds doubtful to you, just read this leaked email from Democratic consultant Tom Matzzie I also want to get your Atlas folks to recommend oversamples for our polling before we start in February.

"Bill Clintons Son Danney Williams has Youtube Channel Restored Youtube had deactivated channel hosting popular documentary linking Williams to Bill Clinton Infowars.com  October 27, 2016 Comments Youtube has decided to reverse its ban on a channel registered by a man who claims to be Bill Clintons longlost son. Your YouTube account was suspended due to repeated or severe violations of our Terms and our Community Guidelines, and as such cannot be restored, the company wrote earlier this week to Danney Williams after he filed an appeal to restore his channel. For decades, Williams has been on a mission to reunite with the person he believes to be his biological father, the 42nd President of the United States, William Jefferson Clinton. The most popular video on the channel , a nineminute minidocumentary posted two weeks ago produced by filmmaker Joel Gilbert, features the 30yearold Williams recounting memories from his childhood which prompted the search for his father. Arguing the channel had absolutely zero violations of any kind, Gilbert places blame for the suspension squarely at Google and the Clinton campaigns feet. Its obvious to me that the fix is in Gilbert wrote in a statement. The only possible explanation is that the Clinton campaign requested YouTube/Google to silence Danny, to run him off the plantation as Danny said Hillary Clinton did to him and his aunt when he was a small child and they were chased off the grounds of the Arkansas Governors mansion in 1990. Youtube later restored Williams channel early Thursday morning claiming a review confirmed it was not in violation of its Terms of Service. Last week, Danney went to Las Vegas  the site of the third US presidential debate  where he held a press conference alongside his lawyers announcing his intention to seek a DNA sample from Bill Clinton in order to settle the paternity dispute. Danney and his lawyers claim a previous DNA test carried out by the tabloid Star Magazine failed to obtain a blood sample from Clinton, an assertion confirmed by one of Stars former editors to World Net Daily . I dont remember ever seeing any laboratory test that was done on Clintons DNA, former Star Magazine editor Phil Bunton stated to WND.

"Most Top Retailers Sell Food Produced With BeeKilling Pesticides Only Aldi, Costco, and Whole Foods got passing grades Julie Fidler  Infowars.com  October 27, 2016 Comments A new scorecard report gives a failing grade to 17 out of 20 major food retailers in the United States, based on their policies and practices regarding pollinator protection, organic options, and pesticide reduction. 1 Source Friends of the Earth Tiffany FinckHaynes, food futures campaigner with Friends of the Earth, said U.S. food retailers must take responsibility for how the products they sell are contributing to the bee crisis. The majority of the food sold at top U.S. food retailers is produced with pollinatortoxic pesticides. We urge all major retailers to work with their suppliers to eliminate pollinatortoxic pesticides and to expand domestic organic offerings that protect pollinators, people and the planet. 1 Organic Offerings And Transparency Are Lacking The report Swarming the Aisles Rating Top Retailers on BeeFriendly and Organic Food is the work of a coalition led by Friends of the Earth and more than 50 farmer, beekeeper, farmworker, environmental, and public interest organizations. 1 The coalition sent a letter urging food retailers to eliminate pesticides that are toxic to bees and other pollinators , and increase U.S. Department of Agriculture USDA certified organic food and beverages to 15 of overall offerings by 2025. The group would like to see retailers prioritize domestic, regional, and local producers. Friends of the Earth and its allies have been successful in the past at convincing more than 65 garden retailers, including Lowes and Home Depot, to commit to eliminate pollinatortoxic neonicotinoid neonic pesticides. According to Haynes, the demand for organic foods has grown by doubledigits , but grocers arent keeping up. She said A lot of the major food retailers have started to increase their organic offerings, but few of them have really adopted clear goals or metrics to continue to significantly increase their organic food offerings in the future. 2 As evidenced by the groups research, its difficult for the public to know where retailers stand concerning pesticide use and organic food. Eleven of the 20 retailers websites examined by Friends of the Earth dont provide basic information concerning their policies on organic food, pollinators, and/or pesticides , Haynes said, adding Theres a lot that retailers could do by adopting creative programs with their supply chain to help farmers grow their organic offerings, and then be able to sell that in their stores. Americans Are Ready For Change A YouGov poll released 25 October 2016 by Friends of the Earth and SumOfUs reveals that 80 of Americans believe neonics should not be used in agriculture , and 65 of those who do the grocery shopping for their household would be more likely to shop at a store that has made a formal commitment to eliminate neonicotinoids. 1 Additionally, the poll shows that 59 of respondents believe its important for supermarkets to sell organic food. Another 43 said theyd likely spend more time at a different grocery store if it sold more organic food than the store they currently frequent. Said Angus Wong, lead campaign strategist at SumOfUs, a consumer watchdog with ten million members Over 750,000 SumOfUs members have spoken out advocating that U.S. Hardware stores take action to protect our pollinators. And after years of pressure, Home Depot and Lowes have finally enacted more beefriendly policies. And the findings of this poll show that a vast majority of consumers want to eliminate neonicotinoids from their grocery stores too. This is why food retailers must commit policies that protect our bees immediately. Only four of the nations top food retailers  Albertsons, Costco, Target, and Whole Foods  have adopted and made public a companywide commitment to increase offerings of certified organic food . They are also the only retailers to disclose data on the current percentage of organic food they offer, or organic sales. Aldi, Food Lion, part of the Delhaize Group, and Kroger disclosed data on the current percentage of organic offerings or organic sales. None of the retailers that the group looked at have publicly committed to sourcing organic food from American farmers . Retailer Apathy Is Killing Pollinators Of the top 20 food retailers surveyed by Friends of the Earth, a shocking 16 were predominantly unresponsive to Friends of the Earths requests for information via surveys, calls, and letters. The group was forced to turn to publicly available information, including company websites, company annual reports, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings, corporate social responsibility and sustainability reports, press coverage, and industry analyses, for their data. We have bees to thank for every 1 in 3 bites of food we take  and without bees, stores would run low on everything from strawberries to almonds. Source Bee Cause Science increasingly points to neonicotinoid pesticides as a leading cause of pollinator decline. Glyphosate, the main ingredient in Monsantos blockbuster herbicide, Roundup, has been shown to play a significant role in monarch butterfly declines . Several U.S. cities have banned neonics, including Boulder City, Colorado , and Portland, Oregon . This past spring, Maryland became the first state to ban the pesticides .

"Store When CIA and NSA Workers Blow the Whistle, Congress Plays Deaf Its pretty clear that those intelligence agencies  not the elected representatives of the people  are running the show in Washington Patrick G.

My own experience in 199596 is illustrative. Over a twoyear period working with my wife, Robin who was a CIA detailee to a Senate committee at the time, we discovered that, contrary to the public statements by thenChairman of the Joint Chiefs Colin Powell and other senior George H. W. Bush administration officials including CIA Director John Deutch, American troops had in fact been exposed to chemical agents during and after the 1991 war with Saddam Hussein. While the Senate Banking Committee under thenChairman Don Riegle, DMich., was trying to uncover the truth of this, officials at the Pentagon and CIA were working to bury it. At the CIA, I objected internally  and was immediately placed under investigation by the CIAs Office of Security. That became clear just days after we delivered the first of our several internal briefings to increasingly senior officials at the CIA and other intelligence agencies. In February 1995, I received a phone call from CIA Security asking whether Id had any contacts with the media. I had not, but I had mentioned to CIA officials wed met with that I knew that the CBS newsmagazine 60 Minutes was working on a piece about the Gulf War chemical coverup. This call would not be the last Id receive from CIA Security about the matter, nor the only action the agency would take against us. In the spring of 1995, a former manager of Robins discreetly pulled her aside and said that CIA Security agents were asking questions about us, talking to every single person with or for whom either of us had worked. I seemed to be the special focus of their attention, and the last question they asked our friends, colleagues, and former managers was, Do you believe Pat Eddington would allow his conscience to override the secrecy agreement he signed",conspiracy

"Statistical Tie Latest Breitbart/Gravis Poll Shows Donald Trump Closes the Gap with Less Than Two Weeks Left Clinton, at 46 percent, leads Trump at 45 percent by just one point Breitbart  October 28, 2016 Comments NEW YORK CITY, New York  Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has closed the gap with his Democratic opponent Hillary Rodham Clinton with just a couple weeks left in the election, the latest national Breitbart News Network/Gravis Marketing poll shows. Clinton, at 46 percent, leads Trump at 45 percent by just one pointinside the surveys 2.3 percent margin of error. Libertarian Gary Johnson gets just 3 percent and the Green Partys Dr. Jill Stein just 1 percent, while 4 percent are unsure. The survey was conducted from Oct. 25 to Oct. 26, sampling 1,824 registered voters across the United States. The poll was conducted using a combination of interactive voice response polling and an internet panel of cell phone users. Something has happened since the third debate, Doug Kaplan, the managing partner of Gravis Marketing, said of the poll. Conventional wisdom was after Trump said he wouldnt promise to accept the results of the election and made the nasty woman comment, many thought Hillary would gainbut Trump seems to be closing the gap. In every election in the last 30 years, this happens where the person behind closes the gap. Hillary still has a clear electoral advantage and many paths to victory. However, Trump is not out of it but Hillary is still the favorite. This is a big story because it shows Trump really closing, importantly, as the other close polls are showing, Democratic pollster Pat Caddell, who worked for President Jimmy Carter and is working with Breitbart News and Gravis Marketing on these polls, added. He is closing with his favorability and unfavorability as well. Caddell said he thinks Obamacares failures, where premiums are skyrocketing, is one of many reasons why Trump is surging. Among other things, that is contributing to Trumps rise in the polls, Caddell said. When we are looking down the road at other things that may be influential, we are seeing the possibility of again on the immigration issuethat thing about concern on the border seems to be increasing as is opposition to Hillary and their plans to expand immigration and refugees, which is another big issue. But more importantly, at the end of the survey, we see both candidates have problems on their ability to unite the country and on whether or not they can have the moral leadership to lead. Theyre basically about the same, which I consider a real improvement for Trump now that hes that close.",conspiracy
"Schools All Over America Are Closing On Election Day Due To Fears Of Violence All it is going to take is a single incident to change everything Image Credits flickr, cali4beach . Will this be the most chaotic election day in modern American history All across the nation, schools are being closed on election day due to safety fears. Traditionally, schools have been very popular as voting locations because they can accommodate a lot of people, they usually have lots of parking, and everyone in the community knows where they are and can usually get to them fairly easily. But now there is a big movement to remove voting from schools or to shut schools down on election day so that children are not present when voting takes place. According to Fox News , voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere. Just a couple days ago , I shared with you a survey that found that 51 percent of all Americans are concerned about violence happening on election day, and all of these schools closing is just another sign of how on edge much of the population is as we approach November 8th. Many officials are being very honest about the fact that schools are being shut down on election day because they are afraid of election violence. The following comes from Fox News  Several schools across the nation have decided to close on Election Day over fears of possible violence in the hallways stemming from the fallout from the heated rhetoric that consumed the campaign trail. The fear is the ugliness of the election season could escalate into confrontations and even violence in the school hallways, endangering students. If anybody can sit there and say they dont think this is a contentious election, then they arent paying much attention, Ed Tolan, the Falmouth, Maine police chief, said Tuesday. His community has already called off classes on Nov. 8 and an increased police presence will be felt around town. And without a doubt, voting locations are soft targets that often have little or no security. We have been blessed to have had such peaceful elections in the past, but we also need to realize that times have changed. I believe that there is wisdom in what Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp told reporters  There is a concern, just like at a concert, sporting event or other public gathering that we didnt have 15 or 20 years ago, said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, cochairman of the National Association of Secretaries of State election committee.  What if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something If that happens at a school, then thats certainly concerning. All it is going to take is a single incident to change everything. Let us hope that it is not this election day when we see something like that. Another reason why polling locations are under increased scrutiny this election season is because of concerns about election fraud. This is something that Donald Trump has alluded to repeatedly on the campaign trail. For instance, just consider what he told a rally in Pennsylvania  We dont want to lose an election because you know what Im talking about, Trump told an overwhelmingly white crowd in Manheim, Pa., earlier this month. Because you know what Thats a big, big problem, and nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody has the guts to talk about it. So go and watch these polling places . And of course reports are already pouring in from around the country of big problems with the voting machines. In Illinois this week, one candidate personally experienced a machine switching his votes from Republicans to Democrats Early voting in Illinois got off to a rocky start Monday, as votes being cast for Republican candidates were transformed into votes for Democrats. Republican state representative candidate Jim Moynihan went to vote Monday at the Schaumburg Public Library. I tried to cast a vote for myself and instead it cast the vote for my opponent, Moynihan said. You could imagine my surprise as the same thing happened with a number of races when I tried to vote for a Republican and the machine registered a vote for a Democrat. In addition, if you keep up with my work on The Economic Collapse Blog , then you already know that a number of voters down in Texas have reported that their votes were switched from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . Well, it turns out that those voting machines appear to have a link to the Clinton Foundation  According to OpenSecrets, the company who provided the alleged glitching voting machines is a subsidiary of The McCarthy Group. The McCarthy group is a major donor to the Clinton Foundation  apparently donating 200,000 dollars in 2007  when it was the largest owner of United States voting machines. Or perhaps the 200,000 dollars went to paying Bill Clinton for speeches Either way, it doesnt look good. After everything that we saw in 2012 , I am convinced that there is good reason to be concerned about the integrity of our voting machines. But Democrats dont like poll observers, because they think that having too many poll observers will intimidate their voters Its unAmerican, but at the same time we have a long history of doing things like that , Ari Berman, author of the 2016 book  Give Us the Ballot The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America , previously told The Christian Science Monitor. Voting was very, very dangerous. I dont think anyones suggesting that were at the same place today. I just think the loss of the official poll observers is going to be really problematic. Without a doubt, this has been the craziest election season that we have seen in decades, and I have a feeling that it is about to get even crazier. But will the end result be the election of the most corrupt politician in the history of our country  If that is the outcome after all that we have been through, it will be exceedingly depressing indeed.

CNN anchor Hala Gorani wasnt expecting her network to be called the Clinton News Network by British firebrand conservative columnist Katie Hopkins from The Daily Mail and watching the ensuing implosion is a mustsee. Hopkins first offense was daring to believe Donald Trump is going to win the election  never a good way to start on CNN I think hes going to win. I think you guys are in for a big surprise, which Im quite excited about. I think weve seen a very similar think here in the UK with Brexit. We saw a lot of the liberal press, kind of, sneering at Brexiteers. We saw a lot of the sneering that we see from the Clinton News Network. Thats CNN. Youre calling us the Clinton News Network Gorani said in shock. Youre exactly correct, Hopkins said. The two argued over how the media are obsessed with polls, especially the ones showing Hillary Clinton in the lead. Hopkins destroyed Gorani saying, Having sat in the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and watched your news network, it is entirely biased, I think, in coverage. Gorani refused to believe and said over her 18year career at CNN, shes only seen nothing but balance at the network. Oddly enough, as the sparring match continued, Gorani repeatedly cut Hopkins off when she criticized the Clintons. So, there goes that theory.

"Germany Students Forced to Chant Allahu Akbar, Punished for Refusing Trip to Mosque Intolerance will not be tolerated Chris Menahan  Information Liberation  October 28, 2016 Comments Islamic indoctrination is now mandatory in German schools. From The Daily Express  PUPILS at a primary school were forced to chant Allahu Akhbar and there is no God but Allah, an appalled father has claimed. The father of the pupil at the girls primary school in German ski resort GarmischPartenkirchen discovered that his daughter had been forced to learn the Islamic prayer when he discovered a handout she had been given. He claimed she had been forced by teachers to memorise the Islamic chants and forwarded the handout to Austrian news service unsertirol24. The handout read Oh Allah, how perfect you are and praise be to you. Blessed is your name, and exalted is your majesty. There is no God but you. It had been given to the girl during a lesson in ethics at the Bavarian school. What are they going to teach, the ethics of conquest and slavery Heres another story from yesterday in RT  Parents of a German teenager may face a trial and fine for truancy after refusing to allow their son to go to a local mosque on a school field trip out of fear that it would lead to his indoctrination by Islamic radicals. The story broke in midJune, when parents of a 13yearold student opposed the idea of their son visiting a mosque in the northern German town of Rendsburg, reportedly organized as part of a geography class. In a letter to the class teacher quoted by the NDR, the teens father argued that his son would be indoctrinated in the mosque. He went on to say that for years we have been hearing reports about religiouslymotivated violence connected with Islamic people. A local education authority subsequently fined the couple a total of 300 328, referring to school regulations and regional laws which include penalties for truancy.  Alexandra Witt @AlexiaStellar October 23, 2016 When the parents opposed the fine, their case was forwarded to Peter MuellerRakow, a local prosecutor, who will decide whether or not to proceed with a court trial, Spiegel reported on Wednesday. The parents lawyer, Alexander Heumann, argues that they refused the school trip out of fear for their sons bodily safety. Denying any faithbased motives, he emphasized that the couple do not belong to any religious group, and are of the opinion that nobody shall be forced into a sacred place against his good will. School principal Renate Fritzsche  told NDR that the field trip to the mosque was meant to promote tolerance and diversity. We also have Muslim children with us and Muslim parents also know that there are no exceptions, she said, adding that swimming lessons and sex education are compulsory for Muslim children as well. It is not the responsibility of the parents to say My child will attend such or such class, Fritzsche asserted.

"Wikileaks Email Hillary Campaign Struggles to Reach Fking Dumb Young People Thats the crap that young people pay attention to Paul Joseph Watson  October 28, 2016 Comments A new email released by Wikileaks as part of the Podesta dump features Hillary ally Wendy Bronfein advising Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta on how to reach fking dumb young people. Marketing executive Bronfein tells Podesta that Clinton may not be the best face to attract younger voters and that she needs to utilize trending figures as par of an infusion to pull younger voters because thats the crap that young people pay attention to. Bronfein goes on to state, Its fking dumb but being cool counts for more than it maybe should. She references Bill Clintons saxophone playing as an example of this before asserting, I hate to generalize a generation but by social media nature, they follow. So if someone they identify as cool endorses  they will likely fall in line with that candidate. Bronfein is introduced to John Podesta in another email as someone who could be immensely helpful in improving HRCs connection to millennials. The email is yet another example of the disdain that Hillary insiders have for Clintons own voters. Yesterday, we highlighted how Clinton ally Brent Budowsky accused Hillary operative David Brock of having a plan that relied upon black voters being stupid. In an audio recording leaked earlier this month, Hillary Clinton was caught on tape saying Bernie Sanders supporters are living in their parents basement and had bought into a false promise. In another email , Clinton operative Bill Ivey spoke of the need to maintain political power by producing an unaware and compliant citizenry. SUBSCRIBE on YouTube",conspiracy
"Maryland Trump Supporter They Switched My Vote to Hillary Yet another report of vote flipping A woman in Hollywood, Maryland is the latest in a number of early voters to claim that her ballot was switched to Hillary Clinton after she had tried to vote for Donald Trump. Maryland Trump Supporter They Switched My Vote to Hillary  https//t.co/FkNiEUOZHH pic.twitter.com/dalY9KBWtj  Paul Joseph Watson @PrisonPlanet October 28, 2016 Noting that she had seen reports on the news of votes being flipped, the woman said, I went in and voted a straight Republican ticket and thank God I went back and checked and they had switched my vote from Trump to Hillary. She said that she had to get the vote changed back by alerting election officials, who simply told her to vote for a second time. I went back the second time and made sure they didnt change it, she concluded. As we reported earlier this week, voters in numerous areas of Texas have made a series of complaints that votes are being switched from Trump to Clinton. One election official responded by claiming the problems were caused by voters not understanding how to use the machines properly. Typically, weve found its voter error with the equipment, Frank Phillips, Tarrant Countys election administrator, told WFAA . Sometimes they vote straight party and then click on other candidates  or do something with the wheel.There is not an issue with the equipment. However, Trump supporters continue to point to the reports as evidence that vote fraud may be taking place. SUBSCRIBE on YouTube",conspiracy

"Clinton Insider Rigging Only Way Hillary Can Win Shes going to lose and she knows it, he said Jamie White  Infowars.com  October 28, 2016 Comments Hillary Clinton and the Democrats have begun stealing the election using every underhanded tactic because its the only way she can win, says Clinton insider Larry Nichols. Shes going to lose and she knows it, Nichols said on The Alex Jones Show Thursday. Unless she can amass and pull off the biggest amount of voter fraud in the history of this country. Nichols explained that the establishment is already doing what it can to prevent an open and transparent election. The DNC filed a lawsuit to try to force the removal of poll watchers at the polls, he said. Why would they do that if they know theres no cheating going on Why would they fight the voter ID if they dont plan to have massive voter fraud The mainstream media and the Clinton campaign are also doing everything they can up until Election Day to make everybody believe that the election is already over in Hillarys favor, Nichols said. Folks, do not believe it, he said. The polling is a part of this game plan to destroy your confidence in your ability to win. I believe Donald Trump is winning, Nichols added. Youre winning. Youve just got to stay the course. Nichols warned that voters must take extra steps to ensure their vote isnt being altered. Youve got to make people at the precinct prove that your vote was recorded properly, he said. If they cant show you proof, then demand a paper ballot. The damning videos provided by Project Veritas exposing highlevel Democrat operatives discussing how they steal elections illustrate that worries about voter fraud arent unfounded, with even the New York Times acknowledging a recent survey showing that most voters fear their ballot wont count because they believe the political process is so dominated by corporate interests.

"Study Finds Women Now Drinking as Much as Men Once a male problem, heavy drinking is now rampant in both sexes Image Credits jarmoluk/Pixabay . A new study found that women have caught up with men as the heavy drinkers over the past 100 years. BMJ Open released their journal that came to the conclusion that women are drinking more alcohol than men and it is having health ramifications. The study, which looked at over 4 million people over a period of over a century, suggested that this is a result from successful marketing campaigns and sweeter alcoholic products being designed for younger women. These results have implications for the framing and targeting of alcoholuse prevention and intervention programs. Alcohol use and alcoholuse disorders have historically been viewed as a male phenomenon. The present study calls this assumption into question and suggests that young women in particular should be the target of concerted efforts to reduce the impact of substance use and related harms, the researchers stated in the news release.",conspiracy

"Big Pharma Targets Profits in Rare Diseases All of the worlds most expensive drugs are used to treat uncommon conditions Image Credits StockSnap/Pixabay . One might think Big Pharma garners most of its profit peddling pills for more wellknown diseases, but new research shows that pharmaceutical companies are instead searching for the next big thing in rare diseases. Big Pharmas profit margins continue to rise considerably with rarer diseases, simply because they can charge more for the pills than they do for medication for more common ailments. The search for the next moneymaker within rare diseases has actually halted some of the advancements for more common ailments, which may explain why they still havent discovered a cure for some of the most common diseases affecting the worlds population. In 1983, the Orphan Drug Act started to incentivize the creation of drugs for rarer diseases to ensure that those suffering from uncommon conditions were not neglected in new scientific research simply because the drugs werent as profitable. Because of the incentives, which include reduced taxes and reduced or waived regulatory fees, over 500 new drugs for uncommon diseases have hit the market since the law was introduced. For common illnesses, Big Pharma can get still turnover big profits while not charging a fortune for the drug. For example, Liptior atorvastatin, which is used to regulate cholesterol, generates a sales profit of 131 billion with the prescription only costing patients around 2 per day. But with rare diseases, prices must be kept high in order to keep Big Pharma in business. This means that while those with uncommon illnesses may benefit healthwise from the new measures, their pocketbooks are in for a hit. For example, the cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco by Vertex costs individual patients 311,000. Gileads Sovaldi, used to treat Hepatitis C, cashes in at 84,000 for a paltry 12week course of medication. And Soliris, used to treat rare blood conditions, costs the patient a whopping 400,000 per year. The list of the 10 most expensive drugs that are currently manufactured are all created to treat orphan or uncommon illnesses. Thanks to these laws that allow Big Pharma to charge these insane amounts of money, they can use those who suffer from rare diseases as their cash cows. Drugs for rare diseases will account for 19 of pharmaceutical branded drug profits by the year 2020. NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news  specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew.

"Breaking FBI Reopens Investigation into Clinton Emails FBI looking into new developments after previously recommending no charges against Democrat candidate Image Credits Gage Skidmore / Flickr . The FBI on Friday announced it is reopening their investigation into Hillary Clintons private email server, another shocking October surprise for the Democrat candidate days from the presidential election. In a letter to committees and lawmakers relevant to the matter, FBI Director James Comey cited recent developments for the bureaus decision to look into new emails which may contain classified information and how they may relate to its previous investigation. In previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clintons personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony, Comey wrote in the letter obtained by CNBC . In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation. Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be signifcant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony, Comey stated. Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz, who led an Oversight Committee effort to pursue perjury charges against Hillary , tweeted about the FBIs announcement. FBI Dir just informed me, The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. Case reopened  Jason Chaffetz @jasoninthehouse October 28, 2016 Back in July, Comey announced the FBIs investigation into Clintons use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state would not result in a recommendation to the Justice Department to pursue charges. Although the Department of Justice makes final decisions on matters like this, we are expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case, the FBI director stated in a speech at the time. Trump I have great respect that the FBI and Department of Justice have the courage to right their horrible mistake pic.twitter.com/LeDNgWvqa2  Washington Examiner @dcexaminer October 28, 2016 Speaking at a campaign rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump jumped on the bureaus decision to reopen its case The FBI has just sent a letter to Congress informing them that they have discovered new emails pertaining to the former Secretary of State Hillary Clintons investigation. And they are reopening their case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States of America. Hillary Clintons corruption is on a scale we have never seen before. We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office. I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Dept. of Justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made. This was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understood and it is everybodys hope that it is about to be corrected. CNBC reports, Stocks turned negative after the report of the new probe, adding that Many analysts have said that markets were pricing in a Clinton victory in November.  ",conspiracy
"Is Deindustrialization a Natural Phenomenon of Developed Economies Increasing real revenues affect peoples lifestyle choices Jrg Guido Hlsmann  Mises.org   Let me first state my position and then add a few arguments to back it up. Economic growth typically entails a reallocation of labor away from industrial production, but it does not all by itself lead to falling industrial output. The decline of industrial production in the US and France in the past thirty years is to some extent due to capital exports, but especially to government interventionism in the form of mushrooming labor, business and financial regulations, education policies, social security funding, and taxation. This decline cannot be stopped through more interventions, even if they are designed with the good intention to reindustrialize the country. Now let me offer a few considerations in support of these contentions. The reallocation of labor in a growing economy results most notably from capital accumulation and from changing preferences of the workingage population. Further investments and extensions of the existing structure of production make it necessary to spend more time devising new methods, preparing industrial activity, coordinating and monitoring supply chains. Lowquality bluecollar labor diminishes, whereas there is some increase in highquality bluecollars, but especially an increase in whitecollars working in and around the supply chains. Increasing real revenues affect peoples lifestyle choices. Rather than laboring long hours that provide essentially a monetary reward, they increasingly prefer enjoyable activities that provide immediate psychological and emotional rewards. Thus the blossoming of artistic, intellectual, and scientific activities in developed countries, at the expense of traditional industrial pursuits. As a natural consequence of economic growth, therefore, industrial production declines relative to what it could be if it attracted even more people. But this does neither imply a shrinking physical industrial output, nor does it imply shrinking industrial revenues. Capital accumulation and technological progress make it possible that industry thrives even when less people have industrial employment. Germany provides an example. In the past thirty years, western capitalists have invested large amounts of capital in formerly communist countries of the East and Far East. This reallocation of capital, though beneficial from the overall point of view of the world economy, has been detrimental in the shortrun to the industrial development of those western countries where the capital would otherwise have been used. But capital investments in countries such as France and the US have declined even more as a result of mushrooming government interventions. Welfare checks diminish the incentive to accept lowpaying and nongratifying industrial jobs. Massive subsidies for secondary and higher education artificially prolong schooling reduce the supply of qualified manual labor and create an artificial bias among the workingage population for scientific, intellectual, and artistic activities. Panoply of regulations have, on the one hand, increased the costs of doing business and, on the other hand, stimulated rentseeking and manifold forms of evasion and regulatory arbitrage. Today they are feeding entire armies of lawyers, accountants, auditors, and financial advisors, all at the expense of ordinary business. These tendencies cannot be stopped through socalled reindustrialization policies, which boil down to even more government spending, premised on the spurious notion that irresponsible and often also inexperienced politicians know best how to use the available scarce resources. Such policies have utterly failed in the past Airbus included, and will fail in the future. Genuine reindustrialization requires more oxygen for industry. It requires nothing less than a rollback of the artificial obstacles for industrial development that government interventions have created in past generations.  ",conspiracy

"The Email That Got John Podesta Hacked Latest WikiLeaks dump reveals phishing email that compromised Podesta Mikael Thalen  October 28, 2016 Comments The email that lead to the hack of Clinton campaign chairman John Podestas Gmail account was published online Friday by WikiLeaks. The malicious March 2016 email, which claims to be from Google, asked Podesta to change his password due to unauthorized access from an IP address in the Ukraine. Clinton campaign staff members who viewed the email were convinced it was genuine. Clinton insider Sara Latham argued The gmail one is REAL while even Clinton campaign IT specialist Charles Delavan said This is a legitimate email. The first suspicious aspect of the email, unnoticed by the Clinton camp, was the bit.ly password reset link. Bitly, a website that shortens long web addresses, would not be found in an official email from Google. As first reported by Motherboard earlier this month, examination of the Bitly link that redirected Podesta to a fake Google webpage also contained several red flags. The Bitly link helped hide not only the fact that the landing page ended in .tk instead of .com but that the web page itself failed to use HTTPS encryption. Such links were also likely used to fool Googles spam filters. Prior analysis of the phishing link by cybersecurity group SecureWorks revealed the hackers also made a significant operation security mistake  they failed to make their two Bitly accounts private. The public accounts revealed the hackers had created 8,909 similar links to use against 3,907 Gmail accounts between October 2015 and May 2016. SecureWorks notes that the targets included individuals in Russia and the former Soviet states, current and former military and government personnel in the U.S. and Europe, individuals working in the defense and government supply chain, and authors and journalists. Accounts linked to the 2016 election were also in the hackers sights. Specific targets include staff working for or associated with Hillary Clintons presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee DNC, including individuals managing Clintons communications, travel, campaign finances, and advising her on policy. Thomas Rid, a professor at Kings college, displayed on Twitter how decoding the phishing links could reveal the specific emails being targeted. Click to enlarge Interestingly, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, whose emails were released by the website DCLeaks in September, was also targeted by the same hackers. Click to enlarge This connection suggests the hackers who provided WikiLeaks with the Podesta emails and DCLeaks with the Powell emails are likely one in the same. The Bitly accounts are also behind the malicious email sent to retired fourstar General Philip Mark Breedlove  whose emails appeared on DCLeaks in April. Numerous cybersecurity groups have accused the Russian government of being responsible not only for the above election season hacks but for creating DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0. to disseminate the data. The U.S. government also publicly blamed Russia on October 7 just one week before the CIA was tasked with preparing a possible retaliatory  cyber strike . Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied involvement, arguing that the contents of the hacks are far more important than who is responsible. Listen, does it even matter who hacked this data Putin said on September 1. The important thing is the content that was given to the public. Putin again dismissed US hysteria concerning the hacks on Thursday during an annual speech at the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi. Hysteria has been whipped up in the United States about the influence of Russia over the U.S. presidential election, he said. Its much simpler to distract people with socalled Russian hackers, spies, and agents of influence. Does anyone really think that Russia could influence the American peoples choice in any way Is America a banana republic or what America is a great power.

"Britain Should Embrace Unilateral Free Trade Right Now Unilateralism is not simply a utopian libertarian ideal Louis Rouanet  Mises.org   Image Credits Iker Merodio / Flickr . If we read the newspapers or listen to the experts, Britain faces two ways to negotiate its way out of the European Union without succumbing to the protectionists sirens. The first is a deal  la Norway not only with full access to the common market, but also with full implementation of EU law and a contribution to the EU budget as is the case for every member State. The second option would be a trade treaty such as the one negotiated between the EU and Canada. However, a viable third opportunity exists unilateral freetrade. Contrary to what is often assumed, unilateralism is not simply a utopian libertarian ideal which cannot be reached in todays world. Unilateral free trade is genuine freetrade. It is also the most pragmatic and efficient strategy to foster commerce and peace. Theresa May seems ready to conduct an interventionist industrial and economic policy which oddly resembles French planning as it existed in the 50s and 60s. But, the freemarket policy paradigm is more likely to transform postBrexit Britain into a flourishing economy. Unilateral Free Trade The British Tradition The tradition of unilateral free trade is tightly linked to the UK. With the victory of the liberals in the 1840s, Britain became strongly committed to unilateral free trade and from 1845 to at least 1914, free trade was politically unassailable. Trade treaties, however, were seen as inherently suspicious. Sir Robert Peel, when announcing the repeal of the Corn Laws in the House of Commons in 1846, brilliantly warned I trust the government  will not resume the policy which they and we have found most inconvenient, namely the haggling with foreign countries about reciprocal concessions, instead of taking that independent course which we believe to be conducive to our own interests.  Let us trust that our example, with the proof of practical benefits we derive from it, will at no remote period insure the adoption of the principles on which we have acted.  Let, therefore, our commerce be as free as our institutions. Let us proclaim commerce free, and nation after nation will follow our example. This repeal of the Corn Laws was the result of an intense political effort, especially by Cobden and the AntiCorn Law League, who made the case for unilateral free trade. Cobden in his later years explained We came to the conclusion that the less we attempted to persuade foreigners to adopt our trade principles, the better, for we discovered so much suspicion of the motives of England, that it was lending an argument to the protectionists abroad to incite the popular feeling against the freetraders.  To take away this pretense, we avowed our total indifference whether other nations became freetraders or not but we should abolish Protection for our own selves, and leave other countries to take whatever course they liked best. Some will argue that the UK soon departed from unilateral free trade with the CobdenChevalier treaty of 1860 which Cobden himself supported and negotiated. It is less known however that this treaty was primarily a way to avoid conflict. After Orsinis attempt to murder Napolon III in 1858, the emperor was convinced, by this same Orsini, to support the cause of Italian independence. This Italian question brought England to the edge of war with France. Being strongly antimilitarists, both Cobden and Chevalier looked at a trade treaty not primarily as a way to adopt free trade, but as a way to establish friendship between France and England. Gladstone, himself an ardent unilateralist, in retrospect held that there were only two alternatives, one of them the French treaty  the other war with France. And Cobden felt that the treaty was Gods own method to produce an entente cordiale. Commercially, the treaty was an incredible success mainly because it was not supervised by bureaucrats  as is the case today with trade treaties  but by two prominent free traders. As Cobden was aware of all the dangers for real free trade contained in the negotiations of trade treaties, he proceeded very carefully. Cobden wrote in a letter to the great British free trader John Bright, I will undertake that there is not a syllable on our side of the Treaty that is inconsistent with the soundest principles of Free Trade. Nonetheless, Bright remained a skeptic and remarked Governments seem as a rule to be standing conspiracies to rob and bamboozle people, and why should that of Louis Napoleon be an exception The more I see of the rulers of the world, the less of wisdom or greatness do I find necessary for the government of mankind. To convince Cobden of the benefits brought about by a treaty, Michel Chevalier showed that the unilateral reductions of tariffs that Bright asked for could constitute the British side of the bargain and could be extended to all other nations, thus avoiding a clear violation of British unilateralism. Free Trade With or Without You The unilateral free trade program is very simple the British Parliament declares the abolition of all tariffs. To avoid a race in nontariff barriers, the Parliament can pass a law declaring that every product which conforms to the EU norms and regulations can be sold freely in the UK. This should not be a problem since the UK still is a member of the EU. By Parliaments act, most of the nontariff barrier problem withers away without any need for regulatory harmonization. If the EU legislator considers it necessary to regulate the curvature of vegetables, so be it But, although EU producers will be free to sell their product in the UK, the British legislator may deem it unnecessary to regulate its producers in the same absurd way. The advantages of this approach are many. First, the UK can have free trade now instead of waiting through years of negotiations. No need to wait for bureaucrats to agree on which laws we burden consumers and producers with. The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement CETA, for example, between the EU and Canada contrasts the expediency of unilateralism with endless negotiations. Negotiations about CETA were started in October 2008 and finished in August 2014. But for the treaty to be effective, each EU member State still has to ratify it. Worse, in some European federal member States, the treaty must be agreed upon by the local federated States. This is why Wallonia recently vetoed CETA, thus threatening the work of a sixyearlong negotiation. In the case of the UK  and whether or not trade treaties are actually advancing free trade  the British economy cannot afford to wait that long for free trade. The second major advantage of unilateralism is the message you send to Brussels. You are signifying to the EU apparatus that with or without you, we will have free trade At this point, the EU will have no leverage left with the UK. The negotiation of a trade treaty, on the other hand is a hopelessly utopian solution, not only because of the obvious coordination problem between the 28 EU member States, but also because the EU has a vested interest in making sure Brexit fails. Eurocrats, starting from the contestable assumption that the UK has much more to lose than the EU, will try to concoct a deal as bad as possible for their fellow AngloSaxon neighbors. Free Trade First, Negotiations Later Still, it is possible that after having declared free trade unilaterally, the EU will decide to restrict the access of British corporations to the single market. This is a particularly valid concern in the financial sector were banks and other financial institutions need licenses to operate in the EU member States. The concern with unilateral free trade is that by respecting it, it will remove any leverage the British government has to negotiate a favorable access to other actual and potential commercial partners. Without a treaty, commercial partners, it is thought, will soon erect protectionist barriers. Unilateral free trade, however, does not mean the UK producers will be bullied without their government being able to respond. First, by declaring unilateral free trade, the maintained strength of commercial links made will make it much easier to negotiate with the EU. To antagonize a good client would be foolish. Lets not forget that this past decade, British exports to the EU grew much slower than exports to the rest of the world. At the same time, the UK is a major consumer of EU products and its balance of commerce with the EU was negative by about 62 billion in 2014. But how can a country committed to unilateralism make sure other countries will not close their markets Let us first remark that maintaining trade barriers to negotiate later with other nations is a selfdefeating strategy. Sir Robert Peel, whom we mentioned earlier, said in 1842 that in the case of wine and brandy he did not reduce the duty, because he hoped that they might employ these duties as instruments of negotiation, with a view of effecting a reduction in the duties imposed by other countries on the produce of our own country. Such a strategy was selfdefeating. Tariffs in view of a negotiation, by reducing the capacity of foreigners to produce for the British market, were destroying the very interests that wanted free trade. Peel finally admitted, in 1843, during a debate in the House of Commons, I am bound to say that it is our interest to buy cheap, whether other countries will buy cheap or no. There certainly is a more efficient policy than maintaining trade barriers or threatening to raise some in order to force trade partners to keep their markets open. Indeed, the British government can make it clear that if the EU unfairly penalizes British interests in some sectors, e.g., finance, then the British government will work to maintain the competitiveness of the industry in question by aggressively lowering their taxes. Imagine that the EU wants to damage Britains car manufacturers. Then the British government should not be afraid to create a loophole and to lower manufacturers corporate taxes  even to zero. In an economy which was never as globalized and competitive as today, the UK would have good chances of prevailing over the EU interests. Perhaps the EU will consider making trading conditions with the UK harder, but they would have way too much to lose if doing so means creating a fiscally ultraattractive market just next door. In the short run, unilateralism in trade can achieve what multilateralism cannot, a quick and radical liberalization of exchanges. In the long run, unilateralism can achieve what multilateralism cannot, genuine free trade.  ",conspiracy
"Image Credits flickr, 9731367@N02 . The following excerpt is adapted from Mendenhalls review of Deirdre McCloskeys book Bourgeois Equality the original review, which appeared in the Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics, is available here. If its true that Wayne Booth inspired Deirdre McCloskeys interest in the study of rhetoric, then its also true  happily, in my view  that McCloskey has refused to mimic Booths programmatic, formulaic methods and boorish insistence on prosaic succinctness. Bourgeois Equality is McCloskeys third volume in a monumental trilogy that began with The Bourgeois Virtues 2006 and Bourgeois Dignity 2010, each published by the University of Chicago Press. This latest volume is a Big Book, alike in kind but not in theme to Jacques Barzuns From Dawn to Decadence 2000, Camille Paglias Sexual Personae 1990, or Herald Bermans Law and Revolution 1983 and Law and Revolution II 2006. Its meandering and personal, blending scholarship with an essayistic style that recalls Montaigne or Emerson. McCloskeys elastic arguments are shaped by informal narrative and enlivened by her plain and playful voice. At times humorous, rambling, and deliberately erratic, she gives the distinct impression that shes simply telling a story, one that happens to validate a thesis. Shes having fun. Imagine Phillip Lopate articulating economic history. McCloskey is, in this regard, a latterday Edward Gibbon, adopting a mode and persona thats currently unfashionable among mainstream historians, except that shes more lighthearted than Gibbon, and unashamedly optimistic. McCloskeys elastic arguments are shaped by informal narrative and enlivened by her plain and playful voice. At times humorous, rambling, and deliberately erratic, she gives the distinct impression that shes simply telling a story, one that happens to validate a thesis. Shes having fun. Imagine Phillip Lopate articulating economic history. McCloskey is, in this regard, a latterday Edward Gibbon, adopting a mode and persona thats currently unfashionable among mainstream historians, except that shes more lighthearted than Gibbon, and unashamedly optimistic. Writing with an air of confidence, McCloskey submits, contra Thomas Piketty, that ideas and ideology  not capital accumulation or material resources  have caused widespread economic development. Since 1800, worldwide material wealth has increased and proliferated the quality of life in poor countries has risen  even if it remains unequal to that of more prosperous countries and the typical human being now enjoys access to the food, goods, services, medicine, and healthcare that, in earlier centuries, were available to only a select few in the richest parts of the globe. The transition from poverty to wealth was occasioned by shifting rhetoric that reflected an emerging ethical consensus. The rhetoricalethical change involved peoples attitudes toward other humans p. xxiii, namely, the recognition of shared experience and sympathy, as Adam Smith stated in The Theory of Moral Sentiments. Attributing human progress to ideas enables McCloskey to advocate the norms and principles that facilitated economic growth and social improvement e.g., class mobility and fluidity while generating extensive prosperity. Thus, her project is at once scholarly and tendentious a study of the conditions and principles that, in turn, she promotes. She argues that commercialism flourished in the eighteenth century under the influence of ideas  such as human equality of liberty in law and of dignity and esteem p. xxix  that were packaged in memorable rhetoric and aesthetics. Not matter, mainly, but ideas caused the Great Enrichment p. 643. In other words, the original and sustaining causes of the modern world  were ethical, not material, and they included the new and liberal economic idea of liberty for ordinary people and the new and democratic social idea of dignity for them p. xxxi. This thesis about liberty and dignity is clear and unmistakable if only because it is repetitive. McCloskey has a habit of reminding readersin case you missed her point the first, second, or fiftyseventh time aroundthat the causes of the Industrial Revolution and the Great Enrichment were ideas, not narrowly economic or political or legal changes p. 470. She maintains, to this end, that the Scottish Enlightenment succeeded in combining the concepts of liberty and dignity into a desirable form of equalitynot equality of outcomes, of course, but of opportunity and treatment under the law. And the Scottish model, to her mind, stands in contradistinction to the French example of centralized, topdown codification, command, planning, and design. A perennial villain lurks in the pages of her history the clerisy, which is an appendage of the bourgeoisie p. 597 and often dubbed the elite in regular parlance. McCloskey calls the clerisy the sons of bourgeois fathers p. xvii and neoaristocratic p. 440. The clerisy includes those artists, intellectuals, journalists, professionals, and bureaucrats who resent the commercial and bettering bourgeoisie p. xvi. The clerisy seeks, in different ways at different times, to extinguish unfettered competition with exclusive, illiberal, irrevocable grants and privileges that are odious to free society and offensive to the rights of average consumers. Early on, says McCloskey, referring to the period in Europe after the revolutionary year 1848, the clerisy began to declare that ordinary people are misled in trading, and so require expert protection and supervision p. 609. The clerisy since then has been characterized by paternalism and a sense of superiority. Because the clerisy is shapeshifting, assuming various forms from time to time and place to place, its a tough concept to pin down. The word clerisy does not appear in the books index to permit further scrutiny. By contrast, McCloskeys general arguments are easy to follow because the book is separated into parts with questions as their titles subparts consisting of onesentence headings answer those questions. In a massive tour de force such as this, readers are bound to take issue with certain interpretive claims. Historians will find McCloskeys summaries to be too breezy. Even libertarians will accuse her of overlooking manifest wrongs that occurred during the periods she surveys. My complaints are few but severe. For instance, McCloskey is, I believe, either careless or mistaken to announce that, during the nineteenth and early twentieth century, under the influence of a version of science, in a territory thats never specifically identified, the right seized upon social Darwinism and eugenics to devalue the liberty and dignity of ordinary people, and to elevate the nations mission above the mere individual person, recommending, for example, colonialism and compulsory sterilization and the cleansing power of war p. xviii. Lets hope that its innocent negligence rather than willful distortion that underlies this odd, unqualified, categorical assertion. Adam Cohens Imbeciles 2016 and Thomas C. Leonards Illiberal Reformers 2016 describe how, in the United States, social Darwinism and eugenics were adopted primarily, though not exclusively, by the Left, not the Right. These recent books come on the heels of several scholarly treatments of this subject Thomas M. Shapiros Population Control Politics 1985, Philip R. Reillys The Surgical Solution 1991, Joel Braslows Mental Ills and Bodily Cures 1997, Wendy Klines Building a Better Race 2001, Stefan Kuhls The Nazi Connection 2002, Nancy Ordovers American Eugenics 2003, Christine Rosens Preaching Eugenics 2004, Christina Cogdells Eugenic Design 2004, Gregory Michael Dorrs Segregations Science 2008, Paul A. Lombardos edition A Century of Eugenics in America 2011, and Alexander Minna Sterns Eugenic Nation 2016. These represent only a small sampling. Is McCloskey unware of these texts Probably not she reviewed Leonards book for Reason, although she did so after her own book reached press. At any rate, would she have us believe that Emma Goldman, George Bernard Shaw, Eugene Debs, Marie Stopes, Margaret Sanger, John Maynard Keynes, Lester Ward, and W. E. B. Du Bois were eugenicist agitators for the political Right If so, she should supply her definition of Right, since it would go against commonly accepted meanings. On the matter of colonialism and war, selfidentified members of the Old Right such as Albert Jay Nock, John Flynn, and Senator Robert Taft advocated precisely the opposite of what McCloskey characterizes as Right. These men opposed, among other things, military interventionism and adventurism. The trouble is that McCloskeys muddying of the signifiers Left and Right comes so early in the bookin the Exordium that readers may lose trust in her, question her credibility, and begin to suspect the labels and arguments in her later chapters. Other undefined terms only make matters worse, ensuring that McCloskey will alienate many academics, who, as a class, are already inclined to reject her libertarian premises. She throws around the term Romanticism as if its referent were eminently clear and uncontested a conservative and Romantic vision p. xviii science fiction and horror fiction are  offshoots of Romanticism p. 30 Jane Austen is not a Romantic novelist  because she does not take Art as a model for life, and does not elevate the Artist to a lonely pinnacle of heroism, or worship of the Middle Ages, or adopt any of the other, antibourgeois themes of Novalis, Franz Brentano, Sir Walter Scott, and later Romantics p. 170 Romanticism around 1800 revived talk of hope and faith and a love for Art or Nature or the Revolution as a necessary transcendent in peoples lives p. 171 Romantic candor p. 242 the late eighteenthcentury Romantic literary critics in England had no idea what John Milton was on about sic, because they had set aside the rigorously Calvinist theology that structured his poetry p. 334 the nationalist tradition of Romantic writing of history p. 353 Romantic  hostilities to  democratic rhetoric p. 510 in the eighteenth century  the idea of autonomy triumphed, at any rate among the progressive clerisy, and then became a leading Romantic idea,  la Victor Hugo p. 636 and the Romantic conservative Thomas Carlyle p. 643. To allege that the clerisy was thrilled by the Romantic radicalism of books like Mein Kampf or What Is to Be Done p. xviii is also recklessly to associate the philosophies of, say, Keats or Coleridge or Wordsworth with the exterminatory fantasies of Hitler and Lenin. McCloskey might have guarded against this misleading conflation by distinguishing German idealism or contextualizing Hegel or by being more vigilant with diction and definition. Her loose language will leave some experts I do not profess to be one scratching or shaking their heads and, more problematic, some nonexperts with misconceptions and misplaced targets of enmity. One imagines the overeager and wellmeaning undergraduate, having read Bourgeois Equality, setting out to demonize William Blake or destroy the reputation of Percy Shelly, about whom Paul Cantor has written judiciously.2 Wouldnt originality, imagination, creativity, and individualismwidely accepted markers of Romanticismappeal to McCloskey Yet her unconditionally derogatory treatment of Romanticismwhich she portrays as a fixed, monolithic, selfevident thingundermines aspects of that fluctuating movement, period, style, culture, and attitude that are, or seem to be, consistent with her Weltanschauung. But I protest too much. These complaints should not diminish what McCloskey has accomplished. Would that we had more grand studies that mapped ideas and traced influences across cultures, communities, and eras. McCloskey takes the long view, as we all should. Her focus on rhetoric is crucial to the future of liberty if, given the technological advances we have made, the work we do will be more and more about decisions and persuading others to agree, changing minds, and less and less about implementation by hand p. 498. Equally significant is her embrace of humanomicsdefined as the story of a complete human being, with her ethics and language and upbringing p. xxwhich materializes in casual references to Henrik Ibsens plays, challenges to the depiction of John Milton as a lonely poet in a garret writing merely to the starry heavens p. 393, analyses of Jane Austens novels, and portrayals of Elizabethan England. Her historical and narrative arc enables us to contextualize our own moment, with all of its troubles and possibilities. Best of all, her book is inspiring and exhilarating and brimming with rousing imperatives and moving calls to action. Let us, then, she says at one point, not reject the blessings of economic growth on account of planning or pessimism, the busybody if wellintentioned rationalism of some voices of the French Enlightenment or the adolescent if charming doubts of some voices of the German Romantic movement, fashionable though both attitudes have long been among the clerisy. As rational optimists, let us celebrate the Great Enrichment, and the rhetorical changes in freer societies that caused it p. 146. At another point she encourages her audience to guard against both cynicism and utopianism p. 540, and elsewhere to heed tradetested cooperation, competition, and conservation in the right mix p. 523. These little nudges lend her credibility insofar as they reveal her true colors, as it were, and demonstrate that she is not attemptingas is the academic wontto hide her prejudices and conceal her beliefs behind pretended objectivities. Poverty is relative and, hence, permanent and ineradicable, despite McCloskeys claim that we can end poverty p. 8. If, tomorrow, we woke up and the wealth of each living person were magically to multiply twentyfoldeven fiftyfoldthere would still be people at the bottom. The quality of life at the bottom, however, would be vastly improved. The current manifestation of global poverty shows how far we as a species have advanced in the last few centuries. McCloskey is right We should pursue the ideas that accelerated and achieved human flourishing, that demonstrably brought people out of distress and destitution. Hard sciences and mathematical models are insufficient in themselves to convey the magnitude and splendor of these ideas and their accomplishments. Hence we should welcome and produce more books like McCloskeys that undertake a rhetoricalethical Revaluation to both examine and celebrate a society of open inquiry, one which not only depends on rhetoric in its politics and in its science and in its economy, but which also yields intellectual creativity and political freedom p. 650. In McCloskeys approach, economics and the humanities are not mutually exclusive rather, they are mutually illuminating and, in fact, indispensably and inextricably tied. An economics that forsakes the dignity of the human person and his capacity for creativity and aesthetics does so at its own peril and to its own disgrace. All economics is, at its core, humanomics. We could do without the latter term if we understood the former. NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news  specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew. Related Articles",conspiracy
"Hillary To Be Indicted After Election Trump Responds To FBI Investigation Clinton scrambles following FBI announcement on new email evidence Infowars.com  October 28, 2016 Comments Alex Jones breaks down the FBIs Friday announcement on the reopening of the investigation into Hillary Clintons private email server as new evidence surfaces. The new data was reportedly uncovered during a separate investigation into Anthony Weiner  the husband of Clinton ally Huma Abedin. FBI Director James Comey cited recent developments for the bureaus decision in a letter to committees and lawmakers today. In previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clintons personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony, Comey wrote. In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation. These new revelations could undoubtedly spell trouble for Clinton as Trump has vowed to fully investigate her actions upon winning the election.

"3 Competing Theories On Why The FBI Reopened The Hillary Email Server Investigation The FBI normally avoids acting just before an election in order to avoid charges of political manipulation American Thinker   There is no question that reopening the FBI Investigation into Hillary Clintons email server is a big deal. The FBI normally avoids acting just before an election in order to avoid charges of political manipulation. NBC reports The FBI is reviewing a new batch of Hillary Clinton emails, bureau director James Comey said in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday. In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation  I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation, he wrote. The very first thing to note is that Comey made no mention of a grand jury. The emails whose existence he learned of may have been the result of a subpoena in another investigation. If that is the case, further subpoenas are quite possible, a tool that was left unused in the investigation to date. There are 3 competing theories as to why he might be doing this now that come to mind. He might be seeking to restore his badly damaged reputation, recognizing that the damage he has inflicted on the FBI is substantial. Three days ago, American Thinker published an open letter from a retired FBI Agent, Hugh Galyean, that laid out some of the damage Comey has inflicted on the institution he leads. There is little doubt that this reached many in the FBI family, putting in print what people have only whispered about. If those silenced voices start speaking out, Comey could face a serious loss of face. In this scenario, he is heading off a staff rebellion, possibly including mass resignations. Rush Limbaugh today discussed an alternative theory, that by announcing an FBI Investigation resuming, Comey is putting a lid on further attention to Wikileaks. I guess this means that Clinton forces will argue we must wait for the investigation to be complete after the election before speaking about what the evil Russians are planting into our politics. It is possible that something so dramatic came up in the pertinent emails that postponing a public reaction by not announcing the reopening of the investigation would, be regarded as political interference by covering up a smoking gun until after the election. In this scenario, Comey is assuming the evidence cannot be suppressed, and that he would be held accountable after it comes out. This scenario also indicates that we could be headed for a constitutional crisis, involving the possible indictment of a presidentelect before an election. Or the evidence being turned over to the House of Representatives for impeachment hearings. Well know more in the coming days, and I am sure there are other possible theories and motives. It is shame that we have to speculate, and that the oncerespected FBI director is now subject to analysis of his political gamesmanship.

"Store 2006 Audio Emerges of Hillary Clinton Proposing Rigging Palestine Election Unearthed tape We should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win Observer   On September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shooin reelection as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press. The tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Chomsky, his oldschool audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer. The tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the reelection battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clintons Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is rigged. Speaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority, Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas 74 seats over the U.S.preferred Fatah 45 seats.",conspiracy

This is what we have been informed, and we wanted to see whether there was any sort of comment that could be provided. If you wanted to steer us away and say that we are misinformed, then I would gladly accept that as well . But we have solid reason to believe this. Wed welcome any comment you can offer. Thanks very much. Eric Associated Press reporter says he knows its true, but will gladly print that its false Whats truly astonishing in this email is how AP reporter Eric Tucker says he will gladly LIE to cover for the Clintons . In plain English, he explains that he has solid reason to believe the report about the thumb drive, but he will gladly publish a false narrative via the Associated Press , and he even suggests what that false narrative should be If you wanted to steer us away and say that we are misinformed, then I would gladly accept that as well. In other words, hes not just corrupt, dishonest and fraudulent as a journalist, hes also SUGGESTING the false narrative the Clintons should use This is the exact same way the AP talks to the CDC about vaccines and measles, by the way. Essentially, the Associated Press reporters say, We are total media whores, we will bend over and grab our ankles while you shove your fake story down the throats of our readers who foolishly think were a credible news organization. You gotta love Eric Tucker for this. The guy takes the prize for finally spelling out in black and white what weve known for years the AP is a total joke when it comes to real journalism .

"YouTube censoring videos  on censorship share in Education , Google , Journalism YouTube has yet again censored another educational video from Prager University. The content of the banned video Criticism of censorship hopefully the irony of their choice to remove it isnt lost on YouTubes executives. The video, titled The Dark Art of Political Intimidation, was released last week and features Kimberly Strassel. Strassel is a Wall Street Journal columnist who explains tactics commonly used by the leftists to shut down free speech from the right. This included blackmail, harassment and intimidation. Back in 2010, the IRS started to target conservative nonprofit organizations intentionally. Groups were experiencing heavy delays when trying to aquire tax exempt nonprofit status. This was an attempt to curb their political involvement in the 2012 election, explained Strassel. A Democratic prosecutor in Wisconsin launched a shadow campaign of financial investigation against conservatives. Their houses were raided before sunrise, with accompanying gag orders to keep them quiet about the raids. The reason for all that was revenge for supporting the Republican Governor Scott Walker. Kimberly Strassel highlights even more examples in the fiveminute video showing censorship of political opponents. Youtube placed the video into restricted mode  which is a common filter used by schools, libraries and parents to shield their children from outrageously obscene and graphic content. NewsBusters reports Conservative radio host Dennis Pragers idea for PragerU is to give students alternative, nonprogressive takes on history, civics and other issues. theres no cursing, no violence or any kind of indecency in any of them. Prager Universitys videos including those that have been censored are all G rated. This leaves questions about why the popular video platform is placing restrictions on them. At least 21 additional videos produced by the conservative not for profit educational organization that is Prager University have been placed into restricted mode by Youtube. There is a petition circulating to stop the censorship, which has aquired over 76,000 signatures so far. Hopefully, YouTube will get its act together about restricting videos that pose no threat to children. Better yet, they should make some key changes to their algorithms to prevent this from happening in the future. A Youtube statement given to Wall Street Journal stated, Video restrictions are decided by an algorithm that factors in community flagging and sensitive content. Basically progressives tripped the algorithm in an attempt to limit free speech and political involvement from conservatives. YouTube has lifted the restriction on The Dark Art of Political Intimidation this past weekend, thanks to the Wall Street Journal giving them a very hard time over the censorship.

"The Rothschild Family has corrupted global banks, news media, oil and government share in Central banks , Currency  debt , Deception , Energy , Freedom The New World Order might seem a bit farfetched for many. A handful of powerful people acting as puppet masters for the human race is a thought that might not even cross the minds of many that have seamlessly adapted to the beliefs that were instilled in them from a young age. The thought that we are all being controlled and enslaved by the banks with the aid of the government is for conspiracy theorists. There is no doubt that there are negative connotations associated with being a conspiracy theorist. That belief has been reiterated many times, mostly from the mainstream media. There are people who see the world for what they are told it is, others see whats really going on behind the curtain. The stranglehold the global elite have on money and knowledge makes them very powerful. They either directly or indirectly control every aspect of our lives. Global megacorporations make up to billions of dollars on an annual basis. A select few at the top of the company make absurd amounts of money, while the employees making the difference and driving the company forward are barely paid enough money to stay afloat. If humans stay busy working 40 weekly hours for very little income, they wont have the time or the resources to realize they have been dealt a bad hand. The top 1 percent doesnt want Americans to be any more educated then to have the ability to help operate and patronize their business. The global elite have a system in place which allows them to grow their global banking empire. All of humanity are literally slaves to the economic system. Money is necessary for our survival in the real world today. Most people will spend the majority of their time working just to survive in the system. If money is the god of our time, that makes Rothschild his prophet. Public School programs worldwide are where the global elite first begin to shape our minds. They continue the shaping through the media. We are taught what they want us to know and nothing more. The rich continue to get richer by purchasing up many successful smaller businesses. When the top 1 percent owns the majority of banks, resources and even our governments, it means big problems for the people. The Rothschilds are worth over 500 trillion and they are just 1 of 13 families that pretty much collectively own the world. The Rothschilds alone could pay off the US national debt 26 times over. Unfortunately they would never do such a thing because they own the majority of the worlds central banks. The New World Orders agenda is slowly taking small steps toward complete and definitive enslavement through use of the monetary system and ownership of resources. Sources ",conspiracy
"Doctors prescribe deadly opioid for painrelated issues that arent even legal share in Big Pharma , FDA , Harmful medicine , Health , medical marijuana , Pharmaceutical Drug Addiction Corruption. Bribery. Death. All three are examined in various news reports on a little known specialty pharmaceutical company called Insys Theraputics. They are currently under legal fire for Subsys, a controversial sublingual spray that disperses fentanyl, a very fast acting opioid that is 80 times more potent than morphine. The under the tongue delivery allows the fentanyl to bypass the gastrointestinal system and deliver the opioid directly into the blood stream. The Federal Drug Administration FDA has ruled that Subsys can only be prescribed to help cancer patients gain relief from sudden spikes of excruciating pain. Sarah Fuller was a 32 year old woman who suffered from anxiety and fibromyalgia . She didnt have cancer. But that didnt stop her doctor from prescribing Subsys for her aches and pains. The fentanyl acted quickly with Sarahs already prescribed Xanax, a benzodiazepine. She died. Her family is suing the manufacturer. But why did Sarahs doctor prescribe a drug that wasnt approved Thats easy to answer. Just follow the money. As Stat reports, the sales of Subsys grew to 331 million precisely because physicians give it to patients that dont have cancer, like Sarah Fuller. Doctors get big dollars to simply talk about the drug over dinner, or lunch. Over 6 million dollars have been paid to doctors and health practitioners for this word of mouth activity. Take the example of nurse practitioner Heather Alfonso from Illinois. She was paid 83,000 to go to dinner with a few people, and in response, prescribed 1.6 million dollars of Subsys scripts to patients that werent suffering with cancer pain. She didnt contest the allegations against her. Getting paid to speak isnt automatically a bribe, but it appears to be a consistent theme when it comes to Susbys marketing methods. Alabama prosecutors built a case against Nancy Reed Perhacs, who used to be a sales representative for Insys Theraputics. Ms. Perhacs coordinated speaking fees for a doctor friend, provided he prescribed Subsys. Her take was 700,000. Other investigations about similar practices are ongoing in Kansas, Rhode Island, New York, Oregon, Michigan, Florida and New Hampshire. The chief executive, founder and chairman of Insys Theraputics is billionaire John Kapoor. Hes been around the block with other controversial pharmaceutical start ups. Kapoor thinks doctors are all ethical. His new FDA approved drug is a chemically created synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol THC called Syndros. As states legalize the real medicine in cannabis , THC and CBD oil , this is an important pharmaceutical to boycott. Sources ",conspiracy
"NYT credibility DESTROYED by 7 simple questions from Newt Gingrich share in Editorials , Journalism , Trump The New York Times publisher and executive editor have promised to rededicate the paper to its fundamental mission  to report America and the world honestly, without favors and fear. The paper claims they will strive to understand and reflect all political perspectives and life experiences in stories brought to the public. This announcement is almost considered an apology to its readers for providing a year and a half of unbalanced and unhinged coverage of the presidential race. Sean Hannity suggests that Trump must ignore the media and trust his gut instincts. He was sad to see the 165yearold paper destroy their credibility over the election season. It was obvious to dedicated readers that the Times had abandoned its old coverage standards. Stories were unrelentingly hostile towards Trump and his supporters. Reporters were including their personal opinions and political analysis in the news coverage. This allowed animosity toward Trump to be spread all over social media by political reporters. Front page stories on The New York Times were accusing Trump of lying, but the paper never published the same findings in reference to Hillary Clinton . The papers liberal readership has even gotten tired of reporting that resembles state controlled propaganda of totalitarian regimes. Newt Gingrich destroys the New York Times credibility with seven simple questions. The New York Times has struggled mightily to answer some serious questions posed by the former United States House of Representatives speaker. Gingrich, a Republican, has asked the times whether they have any reporters, editors or columnists that will say they voted for Trump. He elaborated to ask if they have since hired any Trump supporters to work those positions for the Times. The paper struggled to say whether or not it has hired any Republican reporters at all. Gingrich has also asked if the New York Times has changed its policies allowing journalists to express their opinions about events and people they are covering. The fourth question asked by Gingrich wondered if the Times reporters would surrender any Pulitzer Prizes awarded for news stories containing personal opinions. Here are the final questions that the Times struggled to address. Have its editors retracted misleading news headlines that expressed opinions  such as the papers coverage of Trumps tax returns Has it fired reporters who admitted to writing politically motivated news stories and encouraged interview subjects to talk to them so they could stop Trump Has it retracted its shameful electioneve frontpage story reporting on Trumps innermost thoughts and feelings, virtually every sentence of which is filled with reporters opinions and speculationsfeaturing claims like he is struggling to suppress his bottomless need for attention Sources ",conspiracy
" Reply #328 on August 24, 2015, 073518 PM  Didnt really think Putin was falsely fagging.. Oh well. The Assassination of Russia  FSB false flag bombings of 1999 https//youtu.be/y9cRoXgawVA In the fall of 1999, a wave of bloody apartment bombings swept through Russian cities, killing 293 people and causing widespread panic. Although blamed on the Chechen terrorists that the Russians were fighting in the Second Chechen War, FSB agents were caught planting the exact same type of bombs as in the other blasts later that month. The government claimed that the bomb was part of a security exercise and Vladimir Putin came to power as the next Russian President on the back of the terror wave later that year. http//www.historycommons.org/context.jspitema092299ryazanbomb#a092299ryazanbomb On the evening of September 22, 1999, several residents of an apartment block in Ryazan, a city about a hundred miles south of Moscow, observe three strangers at the entrance of their building. The two young men and a woman are carrying large sacks into the basement. The residents notice that the cars plate has been partially covered with paper, although they can still see a Moscow license plate number underneath. They decide to call the local police. After several bombings of apartment buildings in Moscow earlier in the month see September 9, 1999 and September 13, 1999, their vigilance is understandable. When the police arrive, around 900 p.m., they uncover what appears to be huge bomb three sacks of sugar filled with a granular powder, connected to a detonator and a timing device set for 530 a.m. The bomb squad uses a gas testing device to confirm that it is explosive material it appears to be hexagen, the military explosive that is believed to have been used to blow up two Moscow blocks. The residents are evacuated. Then the bomb carted away and turned over to the FSB. In an apparent oversight, the FSB fails to collect the detonator, which is photographed by the local police. The following morning, September 23, the government announces that a terrorist attack has been averted. They praise the vigilance of the local people and the Ryazan police. Police comb the city and find the suspects car. A telephone operator for longdistance calls reports that she overheard a suspicious conversation the caller said there were too many police to leave town undetected and was told, Split up and each of you make your own way out. To the polices astonishment, the number called belongs to the FSB. Later this day, the massive manhunt succeeds the suspects are arrested. But the police are again stunned when the suspects present FSB credentials. On Moscows orders, they are quietly released. On September 24, the government reverses itself and now says the bomb was a dummy and the whole operation an exercise to test local vigilance. The official announcement is met with disbelief and anger. Ryazan residents, thousands of whom have had to spend the previous night outdoors, are outraged local authorities protest that they were not informed. However, the suspicion of a government provocation is not widely expressed and press coverage fades after a few days. It is only several months later that an investigation by the independent weekly Novaya Gazeta reignites the controversy see February 20, 2000 and Fall 1999. The governments explanations will fail to convince skeptics see March 23, 2000. The Ryazan incident later becomes the main reason for suspecting the government of having orchestrated previous bombings. The controversy is then widely reported in the international press.

Source Terror99.ruA team of FSB officials, led by Alexander Zdanovich, agrees to a televised meeting with angry and suspicious residents of Ryazan, hoping to put down rumors of a government provocation and shore up the credibility of the official account. In September 1999 a bomb was found in the basement of a building in Ryazan and the people arrested for planting the bomb were discovered to be FSB agents. The government then claimed the incident was merely a training exercise, but residents suspect the FSB wanted to bomb the building to create a fake terrorist incident see September 2224, 1999. Zdavonich apologizes for the inconvenience suffered by Ryazan inhabitants but then suggests the renewed interest in the event is a campaign ploy For months, there was no interest and there were no publications. The theme was activated on the eve of the presidential election with the most fantastic details in order to accuse the FSB of planning a real explosion with the death of people. This is actively used in the political struggle. The presidential election is only one week away. A soldier named Alexei Pinyaev has claimed that he worked at a nearby base where hexogen was reportedly kept in sacks marked sugar see Fall 1999. The commander of the base denies that there was any soldier named Pinyaev, but the Novaya Gazeta reporter who had found Pinyaev then shows pictures of him and plays a recording of his interview. The FSB will not let its three agents appear in public or allow journalists to interview them. The broadcast does not allow any discussion of a possible connection between the Ryazan incident and the apartment bombings in Moscow earlier that month see September 9, 1999 and September 13, 1999. The FSB officials did not have good explanations for the fact that local authorities, including its own FSB office in Ryazan, were not informed of the supposed exercise, or for the lack of medical resources for the thousands of people forced to spend the night outdoors. According to David Satter, a longtime correspondent in Moscow for the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times who believes the Ryazan incident was a failed provocation, the broadcast only serves to increase the publics misgivings.

"Zero Hedge October 26, 2016 In the latest revelation sure to reignite accusations of collusion between the Clinton campaign and the DOJ, among the recent batch of hacked emails released by Wikileaks, we learn that the day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, John Podesta, Hillarys campaign chairman met for dinner with a small group of wellconnected friends, including Peter Kadzik , who is currently a top official at the US Justice Department serving as Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs. Peter Kadzik, with lobbyist Tony Podesta, brother of John Podesta . The postBenghazi dinner was attended by Podesta, Kadzik, superlobbyist Vincent Roberti and other wellplaced Beltway fixtures. The first mention of personal contact between Podesta and Kadzik in the Wikileaks dump is in an Oct. 23, 2015 email sent out by Vincent Roberti, a lobbyist who is close to Podesta and his superlobbyist brother, Tony Podesta. In it, Roberti refers to a dinner reservation at Posto, a Washington D.C. restaurant. The dinner was set for 730 that evening, just one day after Clinton gave 11 hours of testimony to the Benghazi Committee . Podesta and Kadzik met several months later for dinner at Podestas home, another email shows . Another email sent on May 5, 2015 , Kadziks son asked Podesta for a job on the Clinton campaign. As the Daily Caller notes , the dinner arrangement is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the Clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of states email practices. As one former U.S. Attorney tells told the DC, the exchanges are another example of the Clinton campaigns cozy relationship with the Obama Justice Department. The hacked emails confirm that Podesta and Kadzik were in frequent contact. In one email from January, Kadzik and Podesta, who were classmates at Georgetown Law School in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate Podestas birthday. And in another sent last May, Kadziks son emailed Podesta asking for a job on the Clinton campaign. A d v e r t i s e m e n t The political appointees in the Obama administration, especially in the Department of Justice, appear to be very partisan in nature and I dont think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server, says Matthew Whitaker, the executive director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a government watchdog group.  Its the kind of thing the American people are frustrated about is that the politically powerful have insider access and have these kind of relationships that ultimately appear to always break to the benefit of Hillary Clinton , he added, comparing the PodestaKadzik meetings to the revelation that Attorney General Loretta Lynch met in private with Bill Clinton at the airport in Phoenix days before the FBI and DOJ investigating Hillary Clinton. Kadziks role at the DOJ, where he started in 2013, is particularly notable Kadzik, as helped spearhead the effort to nominate Lynch, who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president. A Long, Friendly History Podesta and Kadzik have a long history, one which has surprisingly gone mostly unnoticed during the ongoing Clinton email scandal. As DC helps summarize, Kadzik represented Podesta during the Monica Lewinsky investigation. And in the waning days of the Bill Clinton administration, Kadzik lobbied Podesta on behalf of Marc Rich, the fugitive who Bill Clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office. That history is cited by Podesta in another email hacked from his Gmail account. In a Sept. 2008 email , which the Washington Free Beacon flagged last week, Podesta emailed an Obama campaign official to recommend Kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign. Podesta, who would later head up the Obama White House transition effort, wrote that Kadzik was a fantastic lawyer who  kept me out of jail. As the DC Chuck Ross notes, it is unclear to which case Podesta was referring and whether he was joking about prison. But Podesta was caught in a sticky situation in both the Lewinsky affair and the Rich pardon scandal. As deputy chief of staff to Clinton in 1996, Podesta asked thenUnited Nations ambassador Bill Richardson to hire the 23yearold Lewinsky . In April 1996, the White House transferred Lewinsky from her job as a White House intern to the Pentagon in order to keep her and Bill Clinton separate. But the Clinton team also wanted to keep Lewinsky happy so that she would not spill the beans about her sexual relationship with Clinton. Richardson later recounted in his autobiography that he offered Lewinsky the position but that she declined it. Podesta made false statements to a grand jury impaneled by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for the investigation. But he defended the falsehoods, saying later that he was merely relaying false information from Clinton that he did not know was inaccurate at the time. He did lie to me, Podesta said about Clinton in a National Public Radio interview in 1998. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in Feb. 1999 of perjury and obstruction of justice charges related to the Lewinsky probe. Kadzik, then a lawyer with the firm Dickstein Shapiro Morin  Oshinsky, represented Podesta through the fiasco. Podesta had been promoted to Clintons chief of staff when he and Kadzik became embroiled in another scandal. Kadzik was then representing Marc Rich, a billionaire financier who was wanted by the U.S. government for evading a 48 million tax bill. The fugitive, who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism, had been living in Switzerland for 17 years when he sought the pardon. To help Rich, Kadzik lobbied Podesta heavily in the weeks before Clinton left office on Jan. 20, 2001. A House Oversight Committee report released in May 2002 stated that Kadzik was recruited into Marc Richs lobbying campaign because he was a longtime friend of White House Chief of Staff John Podesta. The report noted that Kadzik contacted Podesta at least seven times regarding Richs pardon. On top of the allhandsondeck lobbying effort, Richs exwife, Denise Rich, had doled out more than 1 million to the Clintons and other Democrats prior to the pardon. She gave 100,000 to Hillary Clintons New York Senate campaign and another 450,000 to the Clinton presidential library. Kadziks current role In his current role as head of the Office of Legislative Affairs, Kadzik handles inquiries from Congress on a variety of issues. In that role he was not in the direct chain of command on the Clinton investigation. The Justice Department and FBI have insisted that career investigators oversaw the investigation, which concluded in July with no charges filed against Clinton. But Kadzik worked on other Clinton email issues in his dealings with Congress. Last November, he denied a request from Republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation . In a Feb. 1, 2016 letter in response to Kadzik, Florida Rep. Ron DeSantis noted that Kadzik had explained that special counsel may be appointed at the discretion of the Attorney General when an investigation or prosecution by the Department of Justice would create a potential conflict of interest. DeSantis, a Republican, suggested that Lynchs appointment by Bill Clinton in 1999 as U.S. Attorney in New York may be considered a conflict of interest. He also asserted that Obamas political appointees  a list which includes Kadzik  are being asked to impartially execute their respective duties as Department of Justice officials that may involve an investigation into the activities of the forerunner for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States.  It is unknown if Kadzik responded to DeSantis questions. Kadziks first involvement in the Clinton email brouhaha came in a Sept. 24, 2015 response letter to Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley in which he declined to confirm or deny whether the DOJ was investigating Clinton. Last month, Politico reported that Kadzik angered Republican lawmakers when, in a classified briefing, he declined to say whether Clinton aides who received DOJ immunity were required to cooperate with congressional probes. Kadzik also testified at a House Oversight Committee hearing last month on the issue of classifications and redactions in the FBIs files of the Clinton email investigation.

"RT October 26, 2016 Top NATO  EU officials expressed anger at Spains permit reportedly issued to a Russian aircraft carrier group to take on fuel and supplies at Ceuta, a city with unclear political status. Spain says Russias warships have been mooring there for years. A barrage of harsh statements followed when Spanish media reported that Russias naval battle group led by aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov would make a stopover at the autonomous port of Ceuta after passing the Straits of Gibraltar on Wednesday. Battle Stations Putins fearsome fleet locked, loaded  ready for war with Britain or not Russian ships would moor in Ceuta to take on fuel and supplies under a permit issued by Spains Foreign Ministry, Spanish newspaper ABC reported on Tuesday, also citing Defense Minister Pedro Morenes, who said that there was a prior authorization for this particular case. Guy Verhofstadt, former Belgian prime minister and currently EU envoy for Brexit talks with the UK, expressed his outrage, calling Spains decision the harassment of EU and NATO forces. In a Facebook post, he said that NATO member Spain provides assistance to a fleet which has one purpose, adding that only last week this Spanish Government signed up to a statement from the European Council accusing Russia of war crimes against civilians in Aleppo. Later in the day, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg made it clear that the bloc wants Madrid to rethink the stopover permit. A d v e r t i s e m e n t We are concerned and I have expressed that very clearly about potential use of this battle group to increase Russias ability and to be a platform for airstrikes against Syria, he said. This is something I have conveyed very clearly before and I repeat those concerns today and I believe that all NATO allies are aware that this battle group can be used to conduct airstrikes against Aleppo and Syria. He then downplayed the rhetoric, noting that its for each nation to decide whether these ships can get supplies and be fuelled in different harbors along the route towards the eastern Mediterranean. Late Tuesday night, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said it was reviewing the decision. The latest stopover requests are being reviewed at the moment based on the information we are receiving from our allies and from Russian authorities, the ministry said in a statement, quoted by Reuters. Earlier in the day, however, the ministry told RIA Novosti that Madrid allows Russian ships to dock in Spanish ports as routine navigation which effectively lies outside EU sanctions imposed on Moscow. In the meantime, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry told the Telegraph the requests from the Russian Navy are considered on casebycase basis, stressing that Russian navy vessels have been making calls in Spanish ports for years. Ceuta, an autonomous Spanish enclave on the tip of Africas northern coast, lies along the Straits of Gibraltar and borders Morocco, which also claims the territory as its own. Although Ceuta is part of the EU, its status within NATO is still unresolved. Since 2011, Spain has rankled the bloc by allowing 57 Russian warships to refuel at the enclave. The mission of the Admiral Kuznetsov carrier group has already triggered a media frenzy across Europe, with British, Norwegian, and Dutch navies sending frigates and surveillance vessels to shadow the Russian warships as they round European shores through international waters. Once they reach Syrian shores, the ships will provide backup for Russias naval standing group already deployed to the area, according to the Russian Defense Ministry.

"RT October 26, 2016 Around 300 civilians were killed in eleven airstrikes conducted by the USled coalition in Syria, which Amnesty International investigated for its latest report. Amnesty says the US must come clean about the civilian toll of its fight against Islamic State. Amnesty suspects that US Central Command CENTCOM, which directs coalition airstrikes in Syria, may have carried out unlawful attacks in Syria, failing to take necessary measures to prevent civilian killings. We fear the USled coalition is significantly underestimating the harm caused to civilians in its operations in Syria, said Lynn Maalouf, Deputy Director for Research at Amnesty Internationals Beirut regional office. Its high time the US authorities came clean about the full extent of the civilian damage caused by coalition attacks in Syria. Independent and impartial investigations must be carried out into any potential violations of international humanitarian law and the findings should be made public. Amnesty investigated evidence, including eyewitness accounts, reports by human rights organizations and the media, photographs and video footage as well as satellite imagery, related to 11 suspected coalition attacks in Syria. The group estimates that the attacks have claimed as many as 300 civilian lives. So far none of these deaths has been acknowledged by CENTCOM. The report published on Wednesday added that the total civilian death toll from coalition action could be as high as 600 or more than 1,000 since the operation against Islamic State IS, formerly ISIS, ISIL started in Syria in 2014. One of the strikes investigated by Amnesty took place in the early hours of December 7, 2015. The attacks hit two houses in the village of Ayn alKhan, near alHawl in alHasakah governorate in northern Syria, killing 40 civilians, including 19 children, and injuring at least 30 others, the report said. A d v e r t i s e m e n t According to an eyewitness account, an initial night strike was followed by a second attack from a helicopter gunship, which hit first responders trying to dig out survivors. At this point I had a twomonthold baby boy in my arms whom I had rescued. The hit caused me to fall and drop him I fell into the hole made by the air strike. That was what saved me My mother, aunt, wife and children  a daughter who was four years old and a son who was two and a half were all killed. The woman and her son who Id rescued were killed. Everyone but me was killed, the survivor said. The strike is believed to have targeted IS fighters. But local Kurdish militia reportedly warned the coalition that there were civilians in the area. Amnesty said CENTCOMs failure to acknowledge civilian deaths in Syria, as well as the poor record of investigating such incidents in Afghanistan and Iraq, poses grave concerns over the toll which the civilian population of Mosul, Iraq is likely to face from the ongoing operation to take the city from IS. The USled coalition is providing air support for the offensive. Given the likely increase in air strikes by the USled Coalition as part of the Iraqi offensive to recapture Mosul, it is even more pressing that CENTCOM be fully transparent about the impact of their military actions on civilians. And it is crucial that they adhere scrupulously to international humanitarian law, including by taking all feasible precautions to spare civilians and to minimize harm to civilian homes and infrastructure, said Maalouf. A similar operation to capture Manbij, Syria, which is far smaller than Mosul, killed more than 200 civilians, Amnesty estimated. Last week, Amnesty International blasted Russia for civilian deaths in Aleppo. The Syrian city is divided between government forces and various armed groups, including the AlQaeda offshoot AlNusra Front. Russia says that the militants use civilians as human shields and would not allow them to leave the city, derailing several attempts by Russia to open humanitarian corridors out of the city.

What could also clearly be seen was what appeared to be a lit screen dimming specifically in her podium and not in Trumps just after the debate officially ended. This led to lots of speculation on whether or not Hillary cheated during the first debate against Trump and other debates as well, having her comments fed to her. Well, if the Wikileaks Podesta emails are any indication, its very possible. Why A d v e r t i s e m e n t Because apparently Hillary cant give long speeches without a podium. In fact, these emails and this isnt even all of them, but enough for you to get the picture prove her team is well aware of the fact that everything has to be kept short and sweet unless Hillary has a podium. So how are we supposed to believe she was able to speak at the 90minutes debates without prepared notes being fed to her somehow Especially that final debate where she appeared to be reading more than writing, looking down all the time at some sort of lit screen embedded in the podium as pointed out in other debates, as shown in the video above.

"Re WINDOWS 10  Reply #91 on November 17, 2015, 013705 PM  nVidia even admitted that they intentionally cripple Linux drivers to put performance under Linux the same as performance under Windows.Clips its own products wings to please MicrosoftBy Chris MerrimanMon Oct 07 2013, 1528 CHIP DESIGNER Nvidia has revealed that it crippled its Linux driver to ensure parity with Windows.According to a forum poster at the Nvidia Developer Zone , the v310 version of the drivers for Basemosaic has reduced the number of monitors a user can connect simultaneously to three.The firms reply to the post was the type of dismissive response that the Linux community has come to expect in its dealings with Nvidia.Nvidia said, For feature parity between Windows and Linux we set Basemosaic to three screens.So lets be clear about this. Nvidia has chosen to remove functionality from a Linux driver to ensure that it isnt more capable than the Windows version. This really doesnt sound like the action of a company that wants to get along well with Linux developers and users. So far, Nvidia hasnt indicated whether this is a temporary situation, or more likely a permanent arrangement.There can be one of two obvious motives for this, which amount to two sides of the same coin. Either Nvidia doesnt want to be seen to show up an embarrassing limitation in Windows or the Windows driver, or the continuing acrimony between the graphics firm and Linux is not over yet.While for most users three monitors are ample, making this a fairly niche problem, its an example of a company manipulating the marketplace. Of course controlling the flow of progress in order to sell another product is nothing new  video games makers have been doing that since the 1980s.But to control the flow of progress to favour one platform over another is playing technology god and sets a disturbing precedent.

" Reply #528 on April 07, 2015, 071645 PM  Fukushima disaster caused at least 1,232 fatalities last year as radiation death rate accelerates 7 April 2015 , by David Gutierrez Natural NewsAccording to the most recent report, deaths in Japan attributable to the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster have continued to increase. Last year, the number of deaths increased by 18 over the year before.A March 2011 earthquake and tsunami triggered multiple meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on Japans northeast coast, in what has become the worst nuclear disaster in history. A massive radioactive plume was released by the meltdowns, and the crippled plant has continued to leak radiation into the surrounding environment, including into the Pacific Ocean.A total of about 160,000 people were evacuated as a result of the Fukushima disaster. More fatalities on the horizon According to data collected by the Fukushima Prefecture, 2014 saw 1,232 nuclearrelated deaths. The two towns with the greatest number of deaths were both near the Fukushima plant Namie, with 359 dead and Tomioka, with 291 dead.The term nuclearrelated means a death that does not result directly from radiation exposure but is caused by a disease later caused by that exposure. Indeed, it is radiationrelated diseases  including cancer, tumors and genetic damage  that often cause the bulk of health problems and fatalities in cases of radiation exposure.One of the diseases particularly expected to show an uptick after the Fukushima disaster is thyroid cancer, because radioactive iodine from nuclear disasters tends to concentrate in the thyroid gland. An estimated 6,000 children contracted thyroid cancer following the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. It typically takes four to five years for most nuclearrelated thyroid cancers to manifest, and as that window approaches many Fukushima parents believe that their children are already showing symptoms. Fukushima officials have tested approximately 300,000 children and have turned up 100 cases of the disease, in contrast to the predisaster rate of one or two per million children.One parent concerned about her childs thyroid cancer risk is Megumi Muto. Mutos daughter, Nana, has been diagnosed with lumps in her thyroid gland, and the lumps are growing. Muto is certain that the tumors were caused by Nanas exposure to Fukushima radiation.I feel angry, Muto said. I think the authorities hide the real dangers and now many more children are being diagnosed.The health of both of Mutos children has deteriorated after being exposed to the radioactive fallout, she said.They had rashes on their bodies then nose bleeds. My sons white cells have decreased and they both have incredible fatigue, she said. They may not have cancer now but they both have multiple nodules around their thyroids. Im really worried. Residents suing government Muto and about 100 other Fukushima residents are currently suing the local and national governments, alleging that the governments failed to protect their children during the nuclear disaster.This sentiment was echoed in a recent report, released by a parliamentary panel, which said that the Fukushima incident was, in part, a manmade disaster caused by government, regulatory authorities and Tokyo Electric Power Company, which were all lacking in a sense of responsibility to protect peoples lives and society.Because they do not trust the governments number, Muto and her fellow plaintiffs have conducted their own tests of the radiation levels in their neighborhoods. One test, conducted near a school in Fukushima city, registered radiation levels nearly 100 times that found in Tokyo.Those levels are high enough to warrant investigation, said plaintiff Sumio Konno, who has been a nuclear engineer for 29 years.I have to investigate and inform the public of the facts, that is why I have become one of the plaintiffs of the court cases, Konno said. Theyre still not decontaminating areas where children live or near schools, even after four years. Sources",conspiracy

"Economic Collapse October 27, 2016 Could we see violence no matter who wins on November 8th Lets hope that it doesnt happen, but as you will see below, antiTrump violence is already sweeping the nation. If Trump were to actually win the election, that would likely send the radical left into a violent postelection temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before. Alternatively, there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by Hillary Clinton. And as I showed yesterday, it appears that voting machines in Texas are already switching votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . If Hillary Clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances, that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country. At this moment there is less than two weeks to go until November 8th, and a brand new survey has found that a majority of Americans are concerned about the possibility of violence on election day A 51 majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day one in five are very concerned. Three of four say they have confidence that the United States will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked American democracy for more than 200 years, but just 40 say they are very confident about that. More than four in 10 of Trump supporters say they wont recognize the legitimacy of Clinton as president, if she prevails, because they say she wouldnt have won fair and square. But many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence. On Wednesday, Donald Trumps star on the Walk of Fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pickax Donald Trump took a lot of hits today, and not just in the Presidential race. With less than two weeks to go before America decides if the ex Apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over Hillary Clinton, Trumps star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was destroyed early Wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pickax in what looks to be a Tinseltown first. And there were two other instances earlier this year when Donald Trumps star was also vandalized. One came in January, and the other happened in June  This is of course not the first time the GOP candidates star has been attacked or defaced since Trump announced his White House bid in summer 2015. The most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at 6801 Hollywood Blvd in late January. In June this summer, a mute sign was painted on Trumps star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused Trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign. In both cases, Trumps star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day. We have seen antiTrump violence on the east coast as well. Earlier this month, someone decided to firebomb the Republican Party headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina. On the building next to the headquarters, someone spraypainted Nazi Republicans get out of town or else along with a swastika. There have also been other disturbing incidents of antiTrump violence all over the nation in recent days. A recent Lifezette article put together quite a long list, and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece On Oct. 15 in Bangor, Maine, vandals spraypainted about 20 parked cars outside a Trump rally. Trump supporter Paul Foster, whose van was hit with white paint, told reporters, Why cant they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars, all of this, to make their statement Around Oct. 3, a couple of Trump supporters were assaulted in Zeitgeist, a San Francisco bar, after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Trump, GotNews reports. The two Trump supporters were attacked, punched, and chased into the street by some thugs that a barmaid called out from the back. Lilian Kim of ABC 7 Bay Area tweeted a photo of the men, in which one was wearing a Trump Tshirt and the other was wearing a Blue Lives Matter shirt. On Sept. 28 in El Cajon, California, an angry mob at a Black Lives Matter protest beat 21yearold Trump supporter Feras Jabro for wearing a Make America Great Again baseball cap. The assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app Periscope. There is a move to get Trump supporters to wear red on election day, but in many parts of America that might just turn his supporters into easy targets. Lets certainly hope that we dont see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating. Of course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad, and a Hillary Clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge. For example, this week former Congressman Joe Walsh said that he is grabbing my musket if Donald Trump loses the election Former Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. Walsh, a former tea party congressman from Illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host, tweeted, On November 8th, Im voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, Im grabbing my musket. You in And without a doubt, many ordinary Americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case Hillary Clinton is victorious. The following comes from USA Today  Since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards Hillary Clinton, Ive been buying a lot more ammunition, says Rick Darling, 69, an engineer from Harrison Township, in Michigans Detroit suburbs. In a followup phone interview after being surveyed, the Trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to declare martial law and take our guns away after the election. Today America is more divided than I have ever seen it before, and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another. Ironically, Donald Trump has been working very hard to bring America together. In fact, he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any Republican presidential candidate since 1960 . If Hillary Clinton and the Democrats win on November 8th, things will not go well for Hillary Clintons political enemies. The Clintons used the power of the White House to go after their enemies the first time around, and Hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then. And the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are. This is something that I discussed on national television earlier this month  As I write this, it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a Hillary Clinton presidency would be. But at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome . Out of all the candidates that we could have chosen, the American people are about to put the most evil one by far into the White House. Perhaps Donald Trump can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate, but time is rapidly slipping away and November 8th will be here before we know it.  50  ",conspiracy

The Holy Sees diplomatic history began in the fourth century, but the boundaries of the papacys temporal power have shifted over the centuries. From the 8th century through the middle of the 19th century, the Popes held sway over the Papal States, which included a broad band of territory across central Italy. In 1860, after prolonged civil and regional unrest, Victor Emmanuels army seized the Papal States, leaving only Rome and surrounding coastal regions under papal control. In 1870, Victor Emmanuel captured Rome itself and declared it the new capital of Italy, ending papal claims to temporal power. Pope Pius IX and his successors disputed the legitimacy of these acts and proclaimed themselves to be prisoners in the Vatican. Finally, in 1929, the Italian Government and the Holy See signed three agreements resolving the dispute A treaty recognizing the independence and sovereignty of the Holy See and creating the State of the Vatican City A concordat defining the relations between the government and the church within Italy and A financial convention providing the Holy See with compensation for its losses in 1870. A revised concordat, altering the terms of churchstate relations, was signed in 1984.",conspiracy
"Another reason as to why Ryan tried to sabotage Trumps campaign Paul Joseph Watson Prison Planet.com October 27, 2016 Hillary Clintons campaign circulated the name of one of Paul Ryans relatives as a potential Supreme Court pick, suggesting a conflict of interest that could feed in to the Republican Speaker of the Houses dislike for Donald Trump.

She was confirmed by without any Republican opposition in the Senate not once, but twice. She was confirmed to her current position in 2013 by unanimous consent  that is, without any stated opposition.

"Sputnik October 27, 2016 NATO and Washingtons activities in Eastern Europe and the Baltics de facto amount to permanent military presence, Sergei Ermakov, a senior analyst at the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies, told RT, adding that we have seen only the tip of the iceberg so far. Endless wargames and rotational deployments essentially amount to permanent military presence. NATO is testing a drastic military buildup. We have witnessed the alliance deploy expeditionary forces and assault troops to Eastern Europe. These are offensive, not defensive forces. What we have seen is only the tip of the iceberg, Ermakov said. The North Atlantic Alliance has pledged to refrain from deploying substantial forces along the NATORussia border on a permanent basis, but has been increasingly active in the region. The bloc approved its largest military buildup in Eastern Europe and the Baltics since the end of the Cold War at the 2016 Warsaw summit, a development viewed with deep concern in Moscow. As part of this initiative, Canada, Germany, the UK and the US will establish and lead four battle groups expected to be deployed in Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Each will total up to 1,000 soldiers. These battalions are said to become operational in early 2017. The alliance has justified its massive buildup by blaming Russia for its ostensibly assertive behavior. Moscow has consistently denied these groundless claims. Ermakov further explained that forces of NATOs European members are not as lethal as they might seem. On paper this is a force exceeding Russias military potential by several times. But it lacks real combat power. This is why Americans need to be everywhere. The US was forced to boost US European Commands budget, he said. Earlier this year, the Pentagon requested 3.4bn for its operations in Europe in 2017, a fourtime increase compared to its 789million budget this year. A d v e r t i s e m e n t Russian officials and experts have repeatedly pointed out that NATO increasing assertiveness has put regional stability at risk. The blocs muscle flexing and aggressive rhetoric greatly reduce European security and the chances for a revival of constructive dialogue between Russia and NATO, something Russia has been calling for so many years. Instead, the bloc is doing its best to provoke an arms race with unpredictable results, Peter Korzun, an expert on wars and conflicts, wrote for the Strategic Culture Foundation. Ermakov also said that the United States wants to increase its presence in the Black Sea region to counter Russia. Americans can no longer count on Turkey due to the failed coup attempt. Ankara has become a complicated partner. Washington is instead focusing on Bulgaria and Romania, he said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg mentioned Romania during a press conference held following the latest meeting of NATOs defense ministers. He said that Romanian troops will join the USled battle group in Poland. He also said that the ministers discussed progress made in strengthening NATOs presence in the Black Sea region in the air, at sea and on land. This initiative will include among other things a Romanianled multinational framework brigade on land, he observed, providing no additional information on the subject. Ermakov further said that Washington also wants to counter Russia in Central Asia and the AsiaPacific region.

"Zero Hedge October 27, 2016 We have written frequently in recent weeks about a feud that erupted between Chelsea Clinton and Doug Band back in 2011 after Chelsea raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest between Bands firm, Teneo, the Clinton Foundation and the State Departmentsee here , here, here and here . The feud ultimately resulted in Band being forced to draft a memo spelling out, in vivid detail, the many entangled relationships between himself, Teneo, the Clinton Foundation and the State Department. Fortunately, todays Wikileaks dump included that memo which reveals, for the first time, the precise financial flows between the Clinton Foundation, Bands firm Teneo Consulting, and the Clinton familys private business endeavors. The memo starts with a brief background on Teneo, which was created in June 2011, shortly after Declan Kelly resigned from his position as United States Economic Envoy to Northern Ireland, a position to which he was appointed by Secretary Clinton. In June 2009, DK Consulting was founded by Declan Kelley. Mr. Kelly served as COO of FTI Consulting until June 2009, when he stepped down and established DK Consulting. At that time, he also became the United States Economic Envoy to Northern Ireland . Pursuant to the terms of his exit agreement with FTI and consistent with the ethics agreement of his uncompensated special government employee appointment at the State Department, Mr. Kelly retained and continued to provide services to three paying clients Coke, Dow, and UBS and one pro bono client Allstate . In late 2009, Declan retained me as a consultant to DK Consulting to help support the needs of these clients. In May 2011, Mr. Kelly resigned his Envoy position at the State Department. In June 2011, Mr. Kelly and I founded Teneo Strategies  simultaneously, Mr. Kelly closed DK Consulting and shifted its clients to Teneo. Throughout the past almost 11 years since President Clinton left office, I have sought to leverage my activities, including my partner role at Teneo, to support and to raise funds for the Foundation . This memorandum strives to set forth how I have endeavored to support the Clinton Foundation and President Clinton personally. In a subsequent section of the memo entitled Leveraging Teneo For The Foundation, Band spells all of the donations he solicited from Teneo clients for the Clinton Foundation. In all, there are roughly 14mm of donations listed with the largest contributors being CocaCola, Barclays, The Rockefeller Foundation and Laureate International Universities. The donations from Dow Chemical are particularly notable for several reasons. First, because of other emails revealed by WikiLeaks and other FOIA requests, we now know that Dow Chemical CEO, Andrew Liveris, was granted special access to then Secretary Clinton back in July 2009 at the same time he was embroiled in ongoing litigation with another Clinton Foundation donor, Kuwait, over a failed jointventure that would have netted Dow 9BN in cash . As Band notes in his memo, 1 month after being granted special access to Secretary Clinton, Liveris invited President Clinton and Band out for a day of golf. Moreover, shortly after his meeting with Secretary Clinton and golf outing with President Clinton, Liveris decided to donate 500,000 to the Clinton Global Initiative very convenient timing for all involved. In August of 2009, Mr. Kelly invited Mr. Liveris to play golf with President Clinton and me. Mr. Kelly subsequently asked Dow to become a CGI sponsor at the 500,000 level, which they did , as well as making a 150,000 donation to the Foundation for President Clinton to attend a Dow dinner in Davos. The story gets even more bizarre when Band reveals in the following footnote that Liveris provided the Dow Chemical plane to fly President Clinton and his staff from New York to California and then California to North Korea for their golf outing . We would assume this is a simple typo by Band and/or hes just geographically challengedif not, this certainly raises a whole other set of questions for Bill. Mr. Liveris provided the Dow plane to fly President Clinton and his staff to and from California for our trip to, and from, North Korea . As a private trip, the Foundation had to pay the costs of airfare Mr. Liveris in kind contribution saved the Foundation in excess of 100,000 . According to the Dialy Caller , Dow Chemical paid Teneo 2.8 million in 2011 and 16 million in 2012 for a variety of consultancy services. Of course, Bill Clinton was an honorary chairman of Teneo and, as such, was set to be paid 3.5 million for that position even though he ultimately only kept 100,000 because of the scandals that erupted around the firm, including their advisory relationship with MF Global. Finally, Band also offers the following commentary on the 50 million in forprofit activity he was able to secure for Bill Clinton as of November 2011 as well as the 66 million in future contracts, should he choose to continue with those engagements. Independent of our fundraising and decisionmaking activities on behalf of the Foundation, we have dedicated ourselves to helping the President secure and engage in forprofit activities  including speeches, books, and advisory service engagements . In that context, we have in effect served as agents, lawyers, managers and implementers to secure speaking, business and advisory service deals. In support of the Presidents forprofit activity, we also have solicited and obtained, as appropriate, inkind services for the President and his family  for personal travel, hospitality, vacation and the like. Neither Justin nor I are separately compensated for these activities e.g., we do not receive a fee for, or percentage of, the more than 50 million in forprofit activity we have personally helped to secure for President Clinton to date or the 66 million in future contracts, should he choose to continue with those engagements. With respect to business deals for his advisory services, Justin and I found, developed and brought to President Clinton multiple arrangements for him to accept or reject. Of his current 4 arrangements, we secured all of them and, we have helped manage and maintain all of his forprofit business relationships. Since 2001, President Clintons business arrangements have yielded more than 30 million for him personally, with 66 million to be paid out over the next nine years should he choose to continue with the current engagements. A big part of those forprofit activities was a 3.5mm annual payment from Laureate and millions in speaking fees arranged by Band. Confused Here is a simpler recap from the NYTs Nick Confessore This Doug Band memo, in the latest Podesta dump, is the Rosetta stone of the TeneoClinton Foundation complex. https//t.co/a1g3nSoGPM  Nick Halloween @nickconfessore October 26, 2016 Bands argument I am not get fully compensated for all of the stuff I do for Clintonworld, so you should let me do Teneo. Everyone wins.  Nick Halloween @nickconfessore October 26, 2016 Now, you could argue So what If Band gets his clients to pop over money to a charity, why is that bad  Nick Halloween @nickconfessore October 26, 2016 But consider that Band was selling his clients on idea that giving to foundation was, in essence, a way to bolster their influence.  Nick Halloween @nickconfessore October 26, 2016 Clinton  Band built a platform for executives to bolster their companies images, bathe in BCs praise, and do some good, while  Nick Halloween @nickconfessore October 26, 2016 Teneo extracted earnings for Band and, depending on what you see in these emails, Clinton himself. Teneo paid Clinton until late 11.  Nick Halloween @nickconfessore October 26, 2016 I guess you can wave it all off as a nothingburger. But Chelsea Clinton and some of Clintons other aides were clearly freaking out.  Nick Halloween @nickconfessore October 26, 2016 Generally, the emails show Clintons own closest aides troubled or horrified by things that her surrogates have spent years waving off.  Nick Halloween @nickconfessore October 26, 2016 With that, we look forward to Donna Braziles explanation of how this is all just an attempt to criminalize behavior that is normal.

"End Of The American Dream October 27, 2016 If you want to see war without end, vote for Hillary Clinton. It is tremendously ironic that Hillary Clinton and the mainstream media have attempted to portray Donald Trump as dangerous and temperamental, because it is Clinton that actually has a long history of being emotionally unstable. She has a temper that is absolutely legendary, and she has been cussing out the men and women in her security detail for decades . Hillary Clinton played a key role in starting the civil war in Syria, thanks to her Libya is a postapocalyptic wasteland today, and now she is picking a fight with the Russians before she has even won the election. Of all the candidates there were running for president this election cycle, there was nobody that was even close to as dangerous as Hillary Clinton, and if she wins the election I am fully convinced that World War 3 will begin before her time in the White House is over. Someone that shares this opinion with me is Donald Trump. According to Reuters , Trump recently stated that we are going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton On Syrias civil war, Trump said Clinton could drag the United States into a world war with a more aggressive posture toward resolving the conflict. Clinton has called for the establishment of a nofly zone and safe zones on the ground to protect noncombatants. Some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the United States into direct conflict with Russian fighter jets. What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria, said Trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his Trump National Doral golf resort. Youre going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton. In order to have a nofly zone in Syria, you would have to enforce it. And in order to enforce it, you would have to be willing to shoot at the Russians. According to National Intelligence Director James Clapper , that could have dire consequences Russia could shoot down a U.S. aircraft if a nofly zone were imposed over Syria, National Intelligence Director James Clapper said Tuesday. I wouldnt put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground, Clapper said, speaking with CBS Charlie Rose at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York about several national security issues. Of course Clapper is not alone in that assessment. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Francis Dunford, says that imposing a nofly zone over all of Syria would require us to go to war  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria it would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia, Thats a pretty fundamental decision that certainly Im not going to make.  Senate Armed Services Committee, September 22, 2016, emphasis added But Hillary Clinton is unwavering in her position that this is what she wants. You see, the truth is that Hillary Clinton wants to win the war that she started in Syria. Back in 2011, she spearheaded an effort along with Saudi Arabia and Turkey to try to use the Arab Spring uprisings in the Middle East as an opportunity to try to overthrow President Assad in Syria. If it wasnt for her meddling, millions of refugees would not be pouring into Europe and elsewhere, and there would be no humanitarian crisis in Syria at all. Thanks to Russian intervention, the war in Syria is not too far from being over, but the Obama administration is desperate to keep it going. They understand that if Assad is victorious that all of their efforts for the last five years have been wasted, and that is why they are so determined to keep Aleppo from falling. Without Aleppo, many of the jihadist rebels that the Obama administration has been supporting wont have anywhere to hide. So the Obama administration has actually been considering direct strikes against the Syrian military, and the Russians have already said that they will not allow this to happen . If Obama is insane enough to order airstrikes against Syrian forces and the Russians start shooting back, that could set off a chain of events that could rapidly spiral completely out of control. One recent survey found that current American leadership has a 1 percent approval rating in Russia right now, and the Russians dislike Hillary Clinton even more than they dislike Barack Obama. The Russians know that if Hillary Clinton is elected that it is quite likely that they will have to fight a war with us, and that is why they desperately want Donald Trump to win in November. You can see this outlook reflected in comments that Russian President Vladimir Putin recently made about the two candidates  Mrs. Clinton has chosen to take up a very aggressive stance against our country, against Russia. Mr. Trump, on the other hand, calls for cooperation  at least when it comes to the international fight against terrorism, Putin said. Naturally we welcome those who would like to cooperate with us. And we consider it wrong, that we always have to be in conflict with one another, creating existential threats for each other and for the whole world, Putin noted. Anyone that watched the three presidential debates could see that Hillary Clinton is absolutely seething with animosity for Russia. The thought of her finger on the nuclear trigger is almost too terrible to contemplate, but it may soon become a reality. And even now, the Obama administration and our NATO allies are shifting forces into position for a confrontation with Moscow. This week it is being reported that NATO troops will soon be sent to Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania  Nine hundred US troops are to be sent to eastern Europe next year as Americas troubled relationship with Russia enters new, uncertain territory. A USled battle group of NATO allied soldiers will be sent to Poland as part of the multination operation. British forces will lead one of the four battle groups in Estonia, Canada will spearhead the presence in Latvia and Germany will be present in Lithuania. In addition, Infowars is reporting that U.S. Marines will soon be stationed in Norway near the border with Russia After accepting a Pentagon proposal, Norway will host US Marines at a base near the Russian border as Russia deploys nuclearcapable ships to Kaliningrad. A rotating force of approximately 330 Marines will be stationed at an airfield in the city of Vaernes, just outside Trondheim, beginning in January. Norway and Russia share an 122mile border in the Arctic. The US initiative to augment their training and exercises in Norway by locating a Marine Corps Rotational Force in Norway is highly welcome and will have positive implications for our already strong bilateral relationship, said Norwegian Defense Minister Ine Eriksen Sreide. Most Americans arent aware of any of this, nor do they really care about our relationship with Russia. But in Russia things are completely different. The possibility of war with the United States is the biggest news story over there these days , and feverish preparations are being made for a potential nuclear confrontation  Russian authorities have stepped up nuclearwar survival measures amid a showdown with Washington, dusting off Sovietera civildefense plans and upgrading bomb shelters in the biggest cities. At the Kremlins Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Cold War is back. The country recently held its biggest civil defense drills since the collapse of the U.S.S.R., with what officials said were 40 million people rehearsing a response to chemical and nuclear threats. I know that I have been writing about this over and over , but the truth is that we are on a path to war with Russia, and the election of Hillary Clinton would greatly accelerate the march toward war. In my controversial new book , I expressed my belief that war with Russia is coming, but at the time that I wrote it I didnt know how the election would turn out. At this point it looks like Clinton is very likely to win on November 8th, and that would be absolutely disastrous for our relationship with Russia. If you are reading this and you are considering voting for Hillary Clinton, please dont do it . We simply cannot afford to have an emotionally unstable warmonger with a violent temper in the White House at this critical time. If the American people do choose Hillary Clinton this November, I believe that it will be a choice that they will bitterly, bitterly regret in future years.

The countrys economic performance was stronger than the 0.3pc predicted by economists, and in line with the official forecasts made before the referendum took place  in March the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted third quarter growth of 0.5pc. It also disproves the Treasurys referendum campaign claim that a vote to leave the EU would r esult in 0.1pc fall in GDP in the third quarter that would herald the start of a recession. The Treasurys worstcase severe shock scenario was even more pessimistic, predicting a 1pc fall in the threemonth period.

"Louder With Crowder October 27, 2016 Sometimes a thin layer of crust accumulates on the surface of the ocean, mostly made up of fecal matter and trash. Its where environmentalists come from. They are, effectively, the pits. Also, environmentalists hate people see Top 5 Environmentalists Who Openly Support Killing Off Humans . A side effect of being sad, soggy little bottom dwellers. So its no surprise they want to kill off coal mines in Montana , despite the fact that said coal mines are pillars which help support the economy and the towns well being. Also electric cars , but whatever The 2,300 residents in Southeast Montana face an uphill battle to keep the city alive against an onslaught of legal battles and a major anticoal crusade launched by outsiders. An out of court agreement was reached to close two of the four units of Colstrips coalfired power plant by 2022. The Sierra Club and the Montana Environmental Information Center, which sued the plant, see the closure as a victory. Plant operators came to an agreement with activists because Oregon Democratic Gov. signed legislation mandating the state be coalfree by 2030 Consequences. Its a win for everybody. Except the people employed by the coal plant Also, Colstrips entire economy. Coal plant workers make money, then spend that money at other businesses. Except now all those lads will be jobless, which means they wont be spending money or helping to boost the economy as much anymore, which means other businesses will suffer. Thanks environmentalists. By the way, Green Earth SJWs tend to also be fans of the Indians . The people, not the baseball team. Racist. That wee tidbit is worth noting, considering how their ecofriendly plan isnt very nativefriendly You lose two of those units, and you are shutting down half the town, Small said. This closure will have an economic impact on the reservations, throughout the County and across the State Small is of North Cheyenne descent. Hes made an extra effort to recruit American Indian students Nearly three dozen Northern Cheyenne work at the Colstrip plant, and three times that figure work in the coal fields. A double header. Bad for the economy, bad for the indigenous people. As mentioned above, the coal plant never stood a chance. Thanks to impending regulations, the plant has long seen the end drawing near. Possibly because they would rather close indefinitely in order to be spared from ever having to hear another squawking lobbyist attempt to talk them into seeing things their way. Whatever the reason, environmentalists and the state teamed up to bully the coal plant into shutting down. Now the future of an entire town lies in jeopardy. Environmentalists happily stomped their cloven hooves all over peoples livelihoods. But hey, less smog. #Caring Also, manmade climate change of the hot hots is a myth. Stop it.

"College Reform October 27, 2016 Grinnell College is promoting a guide to help students avoid cultural appropriation this Halloween, warning that some costumes could be considered deplorable and problematic. The guide provides several examples of costumes that might fit the definition of cultural appropriation, defining the term as the act of displaying peoples cultures in a disrespectful or condescending manner. The guide, called My Identity, Not Your Costume, goes on to list several examples of offensive Halloween costumes, featuring pictures of Grinnell students holding photos of costumes that would be considered disrespectful towards their culture. In one instance, the guide shows a picture of a burly white man dressed in lingerie with a sash proclaiming Call me Caitlyn, referring to Caitlyn Jenner. The photo is held by a Grinnell student wearing a National Coming Out Day pin, and includes a caption stating, the misrepresentation of my identity bothers me because people categorize me by my looks and may not understand my culture. Another example of culturally appropriated Halloween costumes, according to the guide, is using other cultures as accessories to appear more hip/interesting without adequate understanding or permission, one example of which is a picture of someone dressed as a Hindu deity being held by an Indian student and the message that such costumes are deplorable and problematic. It then warns students that if their costumes take defining characteristics of another culture without permission, or understanding of the historical background behind the said culture, then these costumes might be too offensive to wear. The guide then concludes with two questions the school thinks students should consider before selecting a Halloween costume, asking, Does your costume perpetuate stereotypes or inaccurately portray my culture as a joke as well as Why would I find your Halloween costume to be offensive Campus Reform reached out to Grinnell for a comment on the matter but did not receive a response in time for publication.

"Liberty Blitzkrieg October 27, 2016 The name Peter Kadzik probably doesnt ring a bell for many of you, although it probably should. This guy is a real piece of work, as an excellent article published earlier today at the Daily Caller demonstrates. Heres some of what we learned The day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, John Podesta, the Democrats campaign chairman, met for dinner with a small group of wellconnected friends, including Peter Kadzik, a top official at the Justice Department. The dinner arrangement, revealed in hacked Podesta emails released by WikiLeaks, is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the Clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of states email practices. Podesta and Kadzik, the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs, were in frequent contact, other emails show. In one email from January, Kadzik and Podesta, who were classmates at Georgetown Law School in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate Podestas birthday. And in another sent last May, Kadziks son emailed Podesta asking for a job on the Clinton campaign. The political appointees in the Obama administration, especially in the Department of Justice, appear to be very partisan in nature and I dont think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server, says Matthew Whitaker, the executive director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a government watchdog group. Kadzik, who started at the DOJ in 2013, helped spearhead the effort to nominate Lynch, who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president. Kadzik represented Podesta during the Monica Lewinsky investigation. And in the waning days of the Bill Clinton administration, Kadzik lobbied Podesta on behalf of Marc Rich, the fugitive who Bill Clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office. In a Sept. 2008 email , which the Washington Free Beacon flagged last week, Podesta emailed an Obama campaign official to recommend Kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign. Podesta, who would later head up the Obama White House transition effort, wrote that Kadzik was a fantastic lawyer who kept me out of jail. Podesta made false statements to a grand jury impaneled by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for the investigation. But he defended the falsehoods, saying later that he was merely relaying false information from Clinton that he did not know was inaccurate at the time. He did lie to me, Podesta said about Clinton in a National Public Radio interview in 1998. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in Feb. 1999 of perjury and obstruction of justice charges related to the Lewinsky probe. Kadzik, then a lawyer with the firm Dickstein Shapiro Morin  Oshinsky, represented Podesta through the fiasco. Podesta had been promoted to Clintons chief of staff when he and Kadzik became embroiled in another scandal. Kadzik was then representing Marc Rich, a billionaire financier who was wanted by the U.S. government for evading a 48 million tax bill. The fugitive, who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism, had been living in Switzerland for 17 years when he sought the pardon. To help Rich, Kadzik lobbied Podesta heavily in the weeks before Clinton left office on Jan. 20, 2001. A House Oversight Committee report released in May 2002 stated that Kadzik was recruited into Marc Richs lobbying campaign because he was a longtime friend of White House Chief of Staff John Podesta. The report noted that Kadzik contacted Podesta at least seven times regarding Richs pardon. On top of the allhandsondeck lobbying effort, Richs exwife, Denise Rich, had doled out more than 1 million to the Clintons and other Democrats prior to the pardon. She gave 100,000 to Hillary Clintons New York Senate campaign and another 450,000 to the Clinton presidential library. The first mention of personal contact between Podesta and Kadzik in the WikiLeaks dump is in an Oct. 23, 2015 email sent out by Vincent Roberti, a lobbyist who is close to Podesta and his superlobbyist brother, Tony Podesta. In it, Roberti refers to a dinner reservation at Posto, a Washington D.C. restaurant. The dinner was set for 730 that evening, just a day after Clinton gave 11 hours of testimony to the Benghazi Committee. Podesta and Kadzik met several months later for dinner at Podestas home, another email shows . And in an email sent on May 5, 2015, Kadziks son asked Podesta for a job on the Clinton campaign. Ill have the lobster risotto with a side of cronyism and middle class destruction. As head of the Office of Legislative Affairs, Kadzik handles inquiries from Congress on a variety of issues. In that role he was not in the direct chain of command on the Clinton investigation. The Justice Department and FBI have insisted that career investigators oversaw the investigation, which concluded in July with no charges filed against Clinton. But Kadzik worked on other Clinton email issues in his dealings with Congress. Last November, he denied a request from Republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation. Seems like a pretty important decision for a Clinton crony to make. The Justice Department declined to comment on the record for this article.

"  Bill Clinton is a sexaddicted monster who mocked Hillary Clinton by calling her The Warden in front of friends and privately boasted about his high notch count, according to his longtime mistress and childhood friend Dolly Kyle.

"Meanwhile Hillary Clinton is at home sleeping Steve Watson Prison Planet.com October 27, 2016 GOP nominee Donald Trump took time out of a relentless campaign schedule Wednesday to spend around an hour opening a new hotel, prompting one CNN reporter to accuse Trump of taking time out of swing states. Meanwhile Hillary Clinton is again nowhere to be seen. CNNs Dana Bash suggested that Trump should be more concerned with campaigning in swing states, yet Trump had three campaign stops scheduled for the same day. Dana Bash Is your DC hotel opening free advertisingDonald Trump No, not at all https//t.co/6OZtrfIwim https//t.co/9HHqooom8r  CNN Politics @CNNPolitics October 26, 2016 So to people who say youre taking time out of swing states to go do this, you say Bash asked. I say the following You have been covering me for the last  long time. I did yesterday eight stops and three major speeches, and Ive been doing this for weeks straight, Trump responded. For you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps. And yet youll ask me that question. I think thats a very rude question, to be honest with you. Trump exclaimed. Trump added that the opening of the hotel also served to prove a point that he can get things built under budget and ahead of schedule, suggesting that the country needs to be able to follow suit. While CNN has continuously run defense for Hillary Clinton amid a myriad of scandals, and even rigged its own polls to suggest she won the debates, the network has been forced to admit that Hillary is running an extremely light campaign schedule. Last month, for example, Hillary went six days without an event except for a short speech she gave in Orlando, Florida. And in August, Hillary took seven of the first 14 days of the month off and even went four days without a single campaign appearance. Her speeches are so short  they dont last long, theyre like 10 minutes and lets get out of here, Donald Trump said about her schedule. Go back home and go to sleep.

A lot of callins about vote flipping at the voting booths in Texas, Trump tweeted. People are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on A lot of callins about vote flipping at the voting booths in Texas. People are not happy. BIG lines. What is going on  Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump October 27, 2016 As Infowars has highlighted , there have already been numerous reports of early voters in Texas seeing their ballots flipped from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. A d v e r t i s e m e n t While election officials have dismissed the reports, suggesting user error is to blame, tech experts have long warned that the machines can become less accurate over time. Larry Norden, a voting technology expert, told NPR that the reports usually arise where outdated technology is being employed. Over time, as people vote, that calibration becomes less and less accurate, Norden noted. During elections over the past decade and more there have been reports of voting machines flipping. Indeed, the reports were so widespread that even entertainment shows such as The Simpsons drew attention to it Meanwhile, The Washington Post has admitted that the press is engaging in voter suppression, bizarrely claiming it is a legitimate way of countering Trumps rigged election claims. Callum Borchers, author at the Washington Post blog The Fix writes Since the final presidential debate last week, many news outlets have been delivering an unvarnished message to Donald Trump supporters Your candidate is virtually certain to lose the election Nov. 8. A day later, the Timess Upshot blog increased Clintons chances of winning to 93 percent , an alltime high. On Monday, Politicos Ben Schreckinger wrote that  Donald Trumps path to an election night win is almost entirely closed . Here at The Fix, Chris Cillizza and Aaron Blake wrote that  Donald Trumps chances of winning are approaching zero . These are accurate, statistically sound statements. But they are something else, too. Declarations that Trump is highly unlikely to win also serve as counters to the Republican nominees warning that the rigged election could be  stolen from us . The latest polls, which Trump insists are rigged due to oversampling, show Clinton with a double digit lead. However, Hillary Clintons campaign manager Robby Mook has warned that Trumps suggestions that the polls are wrong and he can still win are absolutely right. Weve seen polls tighten since the third debate and we expect things to get even closer before Election Day. Mook said, urging Clinton supporters to vote. Make no mistake. With only 10 percent of votes cast, Donald Trump could win this election, Mook said.   915  ",conspiracy

"Newsbusters October 27, 2016 On Wednesdays Morning Joe , cohost Joe Scarborough once again was forced to actually tell the truth about the liberal bias in media coverage throughout this entire election. Scarborough, a former Florida Republican congressman, began the discussion stating that As a Republican theres a natural reaction to press bias and it has been so overwhelming even if it is has been earned. The media has taken sides. Theyve aggressively taken sides and theyve admitted that were aggressively taking sides and I think you get some Republicans that see that every four years. Its so funny. They do that every four years. Every four years its like the end of the world if a Republican gets elected president because theyre all racist. Its the boy that cried wolf. In a sense, what was articulated is that the mass medias historic liberal bias against conservatives is reflected in every election so much so that in this one, their usual partisan attacks against Trumps controversial personality are not as effective. Also, Scarborough stated the fact shared by many conservatives that there is an overwhelming and aggressive agenda by the press to defend liberals. Furthermore, in conversation with frequent panelist Mike Barnicle, Scarborough added Also, its such a confounding election where we go back and forth on what its about, Mike Barnicle said all along that its about Hillary Clinton. People say Im going to vote for Hillary Clinton as a protest against and then after sitting on that for a couple of weeks that thought for a couple weeks they go ehmaybe not. In a way, they were all trying to explain how Trump is still almost tied to Clinton in a number of battleground state polls, despite the disproportionate amount of negative coverage.

"Washington Free Beacon October 27, 2016 CNN commentator Angela Rye on Wednesday blamed the failure of Republicans to repeal and replace Obamacare for the newly announced doubledigit premium increases in the presidents signature health care law. Its not just Hillary Clinton that needs to tackle this but also Congress, Rye said on CNNs New Day. The reason we are in the position that we are in right now frankly, Alisyn, is because Republicans fell short of their promise to repeal, which is what they said they wanted to do, and replace. Host Alisyn Camerota stopped Rye before she got any further and reminded her that President Obama had promised premiums would go down. Most states will see health care premiums under the Affordable Care Act increase by an average of 25 percent, according to data released this week by the Obama administration. Indiana will see its rates slightly go down, but other states like Arizona will see costs skyrocket by 116 percent. Members of the administration have been quick to soften the blow of the increase by reminding people that a majority of those on the Obamacare exchanges would be receiving tax credits to help pay for the now more expensive health insurance plans.   817  ",conspiracy
"RT October 27, 2016 Local authorities in Calais claim that the Jungle refugee camp has been successfully evacuated, but according to an RT crew at the site, a number of refugees and migrants apparently remain at the halfdemolished camp. Unlike the previous days and nights, the demolition of the site on Wednesday for the most part passed off peacefully. This is the end of the Jungle, Calais regional prefect Fabienne Buccio reported. Mission accomplished. The statement may be as premature as the one made in the same words by then US President George W Bush after the Iraq invasion in 2003. RTs crew on the ground reports that dozens of people remain at the camp. Soon after that statement was made we went inside and saw that there was either a massive blunder in terms of their public relations line or a lie. The camp was far from being evacuated and closed, RTs Harry Fear reported from the scene. On Thursday, Buccio warned that refugees arriving at the Jungle camp in the future would not be offered resettlement, unlike those evacuated in recent days. It is not Calais role to receive all the migrants of Europe. We do not want to create a vacuum. We have asked those newly arrived migrants to disperse, she said. Earlier in the day, about 100 migrants were seen filing past police officers overseeing the camp demolition, Reuters reports.   643  ",conspiracy
"RT October 27, 2016 The number of wild animals on Earth could fall by more than twothirds in the 50 years to 2020, according to a new report which places the blame on the destruction of habitats, hunting and pollution. The forecast could lead to major consequences for humans. The Living Planet Report 2016 says that animal losses are on track to reach 67 percent in the 50 years to 2020. The reports authors also took into consideration a recent trend in animal population decline, citing a 58 percent plummet between 1970 and 2012. The researchers analyzed the changing presence of 14,152 monitored populations of the 3,706 vertebrate species  mammals, birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles among them. According to the paper, the biggest cause of the plummeting animal populations is the destruction of wilderness areas by farming and logging. Pollution was also mentioned as a significant problem. Vaccineladen MMs to be distributed via drone for endangered ferrets https//t.co/wm4DUucNxn pic.twitter.com/9a6F9x3raG Humanitys misuse of natural resources is threatening habitats, pushing irreplaceable species to the brink, and threatening the stability of our climate, said WWFs director of science, Mike Barrett. A d v e r t i s e m e n t Animals across the planet are expected to be affected. However, rivers and lakes are the hardesthit areas. Barrett noted that global warming is exacerbating the pressures. We are no longer a small world on a big planet. We are now a big world on a small planet, where we have reached a saturation point, the Stockholm Resilience Centers Professor Johan Rockstrm said in a foreword for the report. The decline in wildlife, along with climate change, is part of the proposed notion of Anthropocene, a term which suggests a new era in which humans have managed to have a significant global impact on Earths geology and ecosystems. The notion  which has yet to be officially approved as a term used to explain geological time  can lead to major consequences. The richness and diversity of life on Earth is fundamental to the complex life systems that underpin it. Life supports life itself and we are part of the same equation. Lose biodiversity and the natural world and the life support systems, as we know them today, will collapse, WWF DirectorGeneral Marco Lambertini said, as quoted by the Guardian. In fact, the report states that humans could be anything but happy if the forecast comes to fruition, noting that the predicted situation could provoke serious competition. Increased human pressure threatens the natural resources that humanity depends upon, increasing the risk of water and food insecurity and competition over natural resources, the report states. There does, however, appear to be some hope. Some species are beginning to recover, suggesting that conservation efforts could help tackle the crisis. However, Barrett noted that in order for such efforts to take place, society must largely change how it consumes resources. Youd like to think that was a nobrainer in that if a business is consuming the raw materials for its products in a way that is not sustainable, then inevitably it will eventually put itself out of business, Barrett said. The report is certainly a pretty shocking snapshot of where we are, he added. My hope though is that we dont throw our hands up in despair  there is no time for despair, we have to crack on and act. I do remain convinced we can find our sustainable course through the Anthropocene, but the will has to be there to do it. The new report comes less than two months after a similar analysis found that Earth has lost onetenth of its wilderness sites since the early 1990s.   641  ",conspiracy

"Record numbers say no to proposed handgun ban Steve   A new poll released by Gallup has found that a record amount of Americans are opposed to gun control measures . The survey found that 76 percent of respondents, over three quarters, believe that a ban on civilian ownership of handguns should not be made law. The findings represent a fourpoint increase on the same survey from last year, in addition to an alltime high for the past three decades. The poll also found that almost two thirds, 61 percent, are against a ban on semiautomatic rifles, or assault weaponsas the corporate media refers to them. That figure represents a full tenpoint increase on previous findings, and is an all time record high since polling began on the issue 20 years ago. Just 27 percent, less than a third, say they support a ban on handgun ownership, while only 36 percent, support a semiautomatic ban. an eightpoint decline on previous findings. In addition, gun sales have been hitting record highs for months on end. In a summary of the new poll, Gallup seemed surprised, by the findings, describing waning support for a gun ban as a paradox Perhaps paradoxically, opposition toward a ban has increased against a backdrop of multiple mass shootings and terrorist attacks in which the perpetrators used assault rifles. These guns were used in highprofile incidents, including the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, California, and Orlando, and the mass shootings in Aurora, Colorado, and Newtown, Connecticut. The findings reveal just how out of step Hillary Clintons position on gun control is with the majority of Americans. Hillary is a staunch gun control proponent. Wikileaks releases have revealed that Hillary plans to implement strict gun control measures by executive order. Clinton purportedly plans to open gun manufacturers to lawsuits by crime victims, a move that critics say would do nothing to reduce crime, but would bankruptand eventually endgun manufacturing in the United States.

"David Brock accused of elitist racism Paul Joseph   A new email released as part of the Wikileaks Podesta dump features Clinton ally Brent Budowsky accusing Hillary operative David Brock of having a plan that relied upon black voters being stupid. The email , sent to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and another Clinton ally CEO Roy Spence, centers around a discussion of a Bernie Sanders campaign ad which featured many black faces. Back in January, Clinton operative David Brock caused consternation within the campaign when he publicly claimed that Bernie Sanders didnt care about black people. Budowsky is not impressed with Brocks outburst, writing in the email, Brock makes the cardinal mistake of those who bring politics into disrepute with voters. He tells a lie that people will know is a lie, and insults the intelligence of black voters with a kind of elitist racism that Bill and Hillary Clinton should not be seen with. I guess Brocks plan is that black voters are stupid and will not watch the ad and believe his lie, writes Budowsky. I cannot think of anything more desperate, more stupid and more selfdestructive than David Brock lying about the Bernie ad and playing a seamy brand of the politics of race using the tactic of deceit on her behalf, adds the The Hill and Huffington Post columnist, before offering to write a campaign ad for HIllary to counter the Bernie Sanders ad. The email once again underscores the Clinton camps paranoia about not being able to authentically connect with AfricanAmerican voters in a way that Bernie Sanders could. Some black voters have been reluctant to support Clinton as a result of her support for a 1994 crime bill that resulted in the mass incarceration of young black Americans, whom Hilary referred to at the time as super predators.

"RT October 27, 2016 Britain is deploying troops, aircraft and armor in the biggest military buildup in Eastern Europe since the Cold War. The deployment, which was first floated in the press by UK defense chiefs on Wednesday, appears to have been prepared well in advance. It will see up to 800 armored infantry troops deployed to Estonia and Royal Air Force RAF fighter jets deployed to Romania in what appears to be a reiteration of the strategy of containment employed against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. France and Denmark will also commit more troops. On Wednesday, UK Defence Secretary Michael Fallon struck a belligerent tone in the Wall Street Journal when he warned that Europe  is our continent  and, as such, would be defended. While he claimed the force would be  defensive in nature  he pledged it would be  fully combatcapable.  A d v e r t i s e m e n t He denied the placement of small formations around the Baltic area are merely a  tripwire  in case of the muchheralded, but hypothetical, clash with Russia.  This is a serious military presence,  he said. Tensions have only just begun to subside after a fleet of Russian naval vessels bound for the Mediterranean Sea passed through the North Sea and English Channel. The passage caused a press frenzy in the UK, framed as though Russia was launching an invasion of the British Isles. The Royal Navy deployed destroyers to, in Fallons words,  manmark  the vessels while the RAF overflew the ships with fighter jets. According to the Russian military, the naval groups task was to  ensure a naval presence in operationally significant areas of the worlds oceans,  as well as  the safety of maritime navigation and other maritime economic activities  of Russia. Britains deployment of troops, drones and aircraft is expected to begin in May 2018. This article was posted Thursday, October 27, 2016 at 645 am Share this article",conspiracy

"American Mirror October 27, 2016 For at least the second time in the last several days, cameras captured Hillary Clintons eyes acting strangely. The behavior, which doctors have told The American Mirror appears to be disconjugate gaze  a common symptom of increased intracranial pressure, or swelling of the brain  was evident again during a rally on Wednesday in Lake Worth, Florida. Here are several more of the instances from today Despite getting major coverage on The Drudge Report, no mainstream news outlet has covered the apparent issue with Clintons eyes. But the several instances over the last few weeks, and as recently as last Friday , have been enough for doctors to publicly call on Clinton to undergo a full medical example and release the results. My rational self would say that they could have defused all this a long time ago by releasing her medical records and having her undergo the same type of neurologic exam that every high school football player in America who gets his bell rung on Friday night must undergo before he can suit up for the game next Friday, Dr. John R. Coppedge, a surgical specialist from Texas, told The American Mirror . A d v e r t i s e m e n t She needs a full neurology evaluation, neuroopthalmology evaluation, MRI, cerebral venography and a lumbar puncture, Dr. Gerald Gianoli, an expert in intracranial pressure, said to this news site. It is possible that her status could be significantly improved. But at the same time, she risks demonstrating to the public that her medical problems are more serious than she has let on in the past. Gianoli, who believes the condition could be the result of elevated pressure, which can cause other problems. It can lead to blindness, deafness, progressive vertigo/balance problems, seizures/stroke and continued problems with concentration, memory and ability to mentally focus, he said. It could also lead to death if the lateral sinus thrombosis were to progress to include the opposite side. This article was posted Thursday, October 27, 2016 at 557 am Share this article",conspiracy
"Why So Few Whistleblowers A Former CIA Agents Story  on Today at 114210 AM  Kevin Shipp is a major whistleblower coming from a solid background as a courageous, decorated CIA officer and anti terrorism expert. He held several high level positions in the CIA. A 2011 New York Times article describes the shocking details of Shipps harrowing personal story of seeking justice and eventually turning whistleblower after his health and the health of his family were severely compromised.Running into the juggernaut faced by so many whistleblowers, Shipp ended up with both his marriage and his career destroyed. Yet in the end Shipp prevailed and managed to stay out of jail. He now speaks openly about both his own personal experiences and how the system works to silence and punish whistleblowers, and in so doing keep corruption and illegal activities at all levels covered up.Shipps excellent essay below explains in detail why so few whistleblowers have come out on highly illegal activities related to Pentagon corruption, CIA manipulation and overthrow of governments, 9/11 shenanigans, secret mind control programs, and much more. His words show just how much courage it takes for people like Edward Snowden and Julian Assange to expose major government corruption. By spreading the word and calling for clear strong laws to protect whistleblowers, we can make a difference.With best wishes for a transformed world,Fred Burks for PEERS and WantToKnow.infoFormer White House interpreter and whistleblowerSilencing WhistleblowersBy Kevin ShippWhy dont more whistleblowers come out to expose illegal or unconstitutional secret government operations If these activities are so illegal, why are people not coming forward to report themOver the last fifty years US government intelligence agencies have perfected a complex, sequential system to systematically silence or destroy any employee, including his or her family, who attempts to reveal illegal or unconstitutional activities conducted as part of secret government operations.As a condition of employment, military and intelligence employees recruited for secret operations are required to sign a secrecy agreement, or nondisclosure agreement, before being given access to the position, which offers high pay and status in the organization. This agreement threatens civil and criminal penalties if the employee reveals ANY information regarding the program. Thinking the agreement will only be used for legal purposes and will get them the coveted job, all employees eagerly sign it.This secrecy agreement was originally designed to protect legitimate classified information, to protect military personnel during wartime and protect legitimate national defense information and technology.However, because of the binding power of the agreement, government agencies began using it as a powerful tool to silence federal employees who question the legality of certain government operations. It was the perfect tool to threaten, silence or jail any whistle blower who dared to challenge the secret operations of government.Today, the secrecy agreement is routinely used as an efficient weapon to intimidate or silence employees. Annual refresher briefings are given to remind employees of the penalties for violating the agreement. These penalties include huge fines, termination, financial ruin and even prison  all of which mean the destruction of their lives and their families. Most will not reveal any wrongdoing, no matter how egregious, for fear of calculated, severe retribution.When employees sign the secrecy agreement and are cleared for classified programs, they are not told they are giving up their right to a jury trial, or to sue the agency that hired them. If they try to do so as a whistle blower, they find they have no right to be heard in federal court. Many have found this out when their case was denied then it was too late. That is part of the system.If the employee attempts to contact their Congressman or Senator, their representative is blocked from receiving any information about their case, because they do not have the necessary clearance.When the employee attempts to blow the whistle to the Congressional intelligence committees, their response is ignored. It is made clear to committee members that they are not to touch such cases, so they refer them back to their Senator or Congressman, who cannot access information involved in their case.If a courageous employee continues to proceed and blow the whistle, a system of personal and career destruction follows. This begins with promotions being denied, being turned down for sensitive or career enhancing assignments, and their files being flagged, ruining their reputation inside their agency. At this point their career is over. If they go quietly, the retribution stops.When the employee still continues their effort to report the information, their travel records, personnel records, medical records and security records are searched for mistakes or damaging information that can be used to threaten them with termination. Their telephones and computers are monitored searching for incriminating information. If no substantive information can be found, it is fabricated and placed in their file.Employees who refuse to back down are then subjected to internal security investigations, multiple, hostile interviews, attempting to get them to recant their information, and multiple polygraph interrogations.In many cases, the employee is commanded to report to the internal medical office for psychological evaluation. If they comply, the evaluation labels them as paranoid, unstable, or disgruntled. This information is placed in their file and is used later to justify the agencys action in the event of outside scrutiny.If the employee contacts a member of the news media, they are immediately cited with violating their secrecy agreement and criminal penalties are filed against them. Several news media outlets are connected to the CIA and NSA and notify them of the employees contact.Finally, the employee is forced to resign after being threatened with termination in kangaroo court meetings where the information fabricated in their files is used against them.After termination or forced resignation, interest rates on their internal credit union loans are raised to make the payments unaffordable. The release of the employees retirement funds needed provide for their family are blocked a felony. The agency black lists them from gaining employment with other government agencies or contractors, further ruining them financially.Dehumanized, financially ruined and under severe emotional and mental pressure, the employees family begins to break apart. If the familys foundation is not strong, this results in alcoholism, depression and divorce. In some cases, it has resulted in the employee committing suicide, the ultimate goal of the program of destruction. This silences the employee permanently, obscuring the agencys role in their destruction. It is the perfect crime.Should the employee still have the resolve to endure this program of career and personal destruction and continues to press for release of the information, or if his family members attempt to sue the agency for the illegal activity, classified agencies will invoke the secretive State Secrets Privilege, which orders the employee and his family not to reveal the information or face prison. If the familys case reaches federal court, the State Secrets Privilege is invoked and the case is shut down  and sealed. Federal judges rubber stamp the censoring of the case without reviewing the case facts.Now that the employees case, and in some cases their familys case, is shut down and under seal, citing national security, the process of silencing the employee is complete. Many are never heard from again, fearing prison if they talk to anyone, including an attorney.Using attractive awards of multimillion dollar contracts, the US government military industrial complex convinces private corporations that their employees must be cleared and sign secrecy agreements. This includes employees at all levels, from secretaries to CEOs. Once they have signed the secrecy agreement, they are bound to keep all information, including potentially illegal information, quiet, being threatened with the same penalties.To date, over five million Americans have been required to sign this secrecy agreement and now fall under the shadow of the State Secrets Privilege.Only a few federal employees have made it through this systematic process of destruction to reveal what they know about the illegal operation they observed. Sadly, some whistle blowers have died mysterious deaths or committed suicide.Employees in intelligence agencies are aware of penalties contained in the secrecy agreement and the huge risk in violating it, even to expose corruption. Most look the other way to protect their careers, retirements and families. Many have observed the outward signs of the system of personal and career destruction used on others and a culture of fear exists. But, they are not fully aware of all that is being done. The full scope of the system is only known at the higher levels of the organization and is hidden from employees, until its use is necessary.This is why we do not see whistle blowers coming out and reporting what they have seen. This system has been used and perfected for over fifty years. It is being used because it works.It works, unless the system is exposed, the whistle blower knows what is coming and prepares for it, and they are supported by private organizations and individuals dedicated to truth in government.This support is essential, not only to protect the whistle blower and their family, but also to defend our Constitutional form of government from tyranny.Kevin M.

"Clinton policy on Syria would lead to WW III Trump  57 am Clinton policy on Syria would lead to WW III Trump Wed Oct 26, 2016 137AM US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at Orlando Sanford International Airport on October 25, 2016 in Sanford, Florida. Photos by AFP US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump says Hillary Clintons policy towards Syria would lead to World War III, arguing that the Democratic nominee would drag the US into an armed confrontation with Russia. Trump made the warning in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, following Clintons proposal for the establishment of a nofly zone and safe zones in Syria earlier this month. What we should do is focus on ISIL Daesh. We should not be focusing on Syria, Trump said. Youre going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton, he said. On October 7, the Democratic nominee said a nofly zone was required inside the warravaged country to stabilize fighting, a move that was opposed in Congress due to the risk of entering into conflict with Russia, since a USenforced nofly zone would mean the US could shoot down Russian fighter jets should they enter Syrian airspace. Clinton also described the situation in Syria as incredibly complex since the intervention of Russia. US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speaks at an early vote rally at Broward College in Coconut Creek, Florida, on October 25, 2016. Youre not fighting Syria anymore youre fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk, Trump said. The Republican nominee also referred to the removal of Syrian President Bashar alAssad from power as a secondlevel priority to defeating Daesh. Assad is secondary, to me, to ISIL, Trump said. Russia might down US planes Meanwhile, US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper also warned about the consequences of Clintons push for a nofly zone in Syria that could spark a conflict with Russia. Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations, Clapper said Clintons proposal for the establishment of a nofly zone in Syria could lead to Russia shooting down American planes there. James Clapper, the US director of National Intelligence, speaks at the Council of Foreign Relations, on October 25, 2016 in New York City. I wouldnt put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they  if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground, he said. I take stock in the nature of the weaponry that they deploy and why they  why they did that, Clapper said of Russian weapons recently deployed to Syria. The system they have there is a very advanced airdefense system. Its very capable. And I dont think theyd do it and deploy it unless they had some intent to use it. During the third and final presidential debate last week, Clinton reiterated her remarks on a nofly zone that could save lives and hasten the end of the conflict in Syria. A foreignbacked militancy has been going on in Syria since March 2011, with a plethora of armed groups  each supported by one foreign country or another  fighting the Assad government. Since 2014, the United States, along with a number of its allies, has been leading a socalled antiterror campaign in Syria and neighboring Iraq. Instead of helping to rein in the Takfiri terrorists, the air raids have killed many civilians, and caused extensive damage to the countrys infrastructure. Iran has been offering Syria advisory military help. Russia, another Syrian ally, has also been conducting an aerial bombardment campaign against militant positions in Syria at a request from Damascus. The foreignsponsored conflict in Syria has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions.",hate

"Clintons NoFly Zone over Syria Will Lead to War with Russia. Warning of JCS Chairman General Dunford October 27, 2016 at 1018 am Global Research , October 23, 2016 The media has failed to address the confrontation between the U.S. State Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Francis Dunford image right has warned both the US Senate as well Secretary of State John Kerry in no uncertain terms that a No Fly Zone over Syria would lead to war with both Syria and Russia, intimating a dangerous process of military escalation. In a Senate Arms Services Committee hearing, Dunford said, responding to questions from Republican Senator Roger Whicker Mississippi Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria it would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia, Thats a pretty fundamental decision that certainly Im not going to make.  Senate Armed Services Committee, September 22, 2016, emphasis added At the third presidential debate, Hillary Clinton reasserted her commitment that if elected president, she would implement a noflyzone, intimating that the objective was to save lives I think a nofly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict. I am well aware of the really legitimate concerns you have expressed from both the president and the general, Clinton said in response to a question from Fox News debate moderator Chris Wallace. This would not be done just on the first day. This would take a lot of negotiation and would also take making it clear to the Russians and Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground  I think we could strike a deal and make it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interest of the people on the ground in Syria. Fox News, emphasis added At present, under the Obama administration, the joint chiefs of staff are opposed to the No Fly zone. The Joint Chiefs of Staff are appointed by the Secretary of Defense. Under a Clinton presidency, a new Secretary of Defense as well as a new Chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, firmly committed to A No fly Zone over Syria would be appointed. Michle Angelique Flournoy, a former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy is Hillarys choice for the position of Secretary of Defense, who favors the No Fly Zone option. According to Defense One The woman expected to run the Pentagon under Hillary Clinton said she would direct U.S. troops to push President Bashar alAssads forces out of southern Syria and would send more American boots to fight the Islamic State in the region. Confirmed by the Leaked Emails Michele Flournoy is a crony of the Clintons. She has called for limited military coercion to help remove Assad from power in Syria, including a no bombing zone over parts of Syria held by U.S.backed rebels. This is tantamount to a no fly zone to protect the terrorists including ISIS Daesh from actions by Syrian and Russian forces. According to Defense One Flournoy, and several of her colleagues at the Center for New American Security, or CNAS, have been making the case for sending more American troops into combat against ISIS and the Assad regime than the Obama administration has been willing to commit.Since Russias increased involvement, the facts on the ground in Syria, she said, Do not support the kind of negotiated conditions we would like to get to. U.S. policy should be the removal of Assad even if that meant using limited military coercion, Flournoy said, at Mondays annual CNAS conference in Washington. Flournoy did not deny the entire report that she favors increased U.S. intervention for instance, she acknowledged her support for U.S. strikes using standoff weapons  to retaliate against Syrian military targets to enforce the nobomb zone. The press reports, however, did not quote the details of the discussion and testimony of General Dunford and Secretary of Defense Carter at the Arms Services Committee Hearing Let me see if the Chairman wants to add anything.Senator Wicker Well, let me just ask this, if you dont mind, Secretary Carter. It would help if the barrel bombing ended. And I spoke to a Democratic colleague of mine today. Ive been calling for a nofly zone to stop the barrel bombing, and I asked this colleague of mine on the other side of the aisle if he would support that. And he said, Yes. He said, I want to call it something else, rather than a nofly zone, but that this particular Senator it is a fact that this particular Senator has now changed his position and would like us to take action to present  to prevent the barrel bombing. What is your position about that And wouldnt it help if we took decisive action and ended this carnage Secretary Carter I dont know the specific proposal which youre discussing with your colleague. Ill make one comment and see if the Chairman wants to add anything. Senator Wicker I think he was talking about a nofly zone  Secretary Carter Well, okay. Senator Wicker  but described in more palatable terms. Secretary Carter There are  a number of different proposals have been made, but I  the one that I think it the focus on right now is the one Secretary Kerrys trying to promote, namely a nofly zone for the Russians and the Syrians who are attacking the Syrian people. If theyre talking about a nofly zone for American aircraft fighting ISIL, needless to say, that  thats not going to get any enthusiasm, get strong opposition from me. Senator Wicker Im speaking about a  Secretary Carter But, I think thats what a  but  its not called that, but Secretary Kerry is trying to get a standdown of the Syrian and Russian air force. And if hes successful, that would be a good thing. Let me ask the Chairman if he has anything to add. General Dunford Senator, the only thing Id say is, you know, as the situation on the ground changes, I think I have a responsibility  we, the joint force, has a responsibility  to make sure the President has a full range of options. We have discussed that issue in the past under certain conditions. The conditions on the ground will change, and well continue to look at those options and make sure theyre available to the President. Senator Wicker What about the option of controlling the airspace so that barrel bombs cannot be dropped General Dunford All options  Senator Wicker What do you think of that option, sir General Dunford Right now, Senator, for all of the airspace in Syria, it would require war against Syria and Russia. Thats a pretty fundamental decision that certainly Im not going to make. Concluding Remarks From the above testimonies and statements, one thing is clear. Decisionmakers at highest levels of the US government and the military believe in their own propaganda. They are not able to reflect on their actions outside the realm of propaganda. And this also applies to nuclear warfare which is presented as a peacemaking operation. It is unlikely that any drastic action regarding a no fly zone will be taken under the Obama administration prior to the November elections and the instatement of a new president of the US in January 2017. Consequently, the next three months will be absolutely crucial for Syria. i.e. During this period, the counterterrorism campaign waged by Syria with the support of Russia and Iran will seek to eliminate remaining terrorist pockets and pacify the entire country. The footsoldiers of the Western military alliance will be defeated on the ground. If this objective is achieved, it will inevitably have an impact on US options regarding the proposed deployment of groundforces and the No Fly Zone. What prevails, however, is an attempt on the part of Washington to redeploy its ISIS terrorist footsoldiers in Mosul by transferring them from Iraq to Syria.

"How they could steal the election from Trump even if he is announced the winner next Tuesday October 31, 2016 at 213 am How they could steal the election from Trump even if he is announced the winner next Tuesday By Dr. Patrick Slattery  There has been a great deal of talk recently about the rigging of elections. Trump talks about it, and then the media accuses him of being a threat to democracy by refusing to accept the will of the voters. Nobody asks Hillary if she will accept the will of the voters Of course, we know that our electoral system is unfair, biased, and even rigged at a variety of levels. Without going into detail, the media, which plays an absolutely crucial role in staging our elections, has abandoned even the pretense of neutrality. Ballot access is unfair. Campaign finance is corrupt. Electronic voting machines are vulnerable. Voting by foreigners and dead people exists, as does multiple voting by individuals. But one massive threat has so far gone completely unmentioned the vulnerability of the electoral college to postelection shenanigans. What people are not aware of is that, under the Constitution, the president is not elected on November 8. The Tuesday after the first Monday in November is designated for Congressional elections. It just so happens that over the years all the states decided to have their electors to the Electoral College selected by the voters on that day. In the early days of the Republic, it was actually more common for state legislatures to select the electors, and the Constitution allows the state legislatures to determine how the electors are selected. It is actually the Electoral College that elects the president, and that happens on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December, which this year will be December 19. On this day, the electors will meet in their respective state capitals to cast their ballots, which will then be sent to Washington to be opened by Vice President Biden before a joint session of Congress on January 6 of next year. Some of you may remember the scene from Michael Moores Fahrenheit 911 showing Vice President Gore reading votes that elected President Bush, ironically denying the objections raised by some Congressmen to Floridas electoral votes, which Bush won over Gore amidst the greatest of controversy. So if this system is enshrined in the Constitution, what could possibly go wrong Plenty. Unless Hillary goes into complete meltdown over the next week, a Trump victory on November 8 will likely be a narrow one in terms of the electoral college map. One very plausible scenario has Trump losing Pennsylvania but winning the rest of the main battleground states plus one of Maines congressional districts. Maine, along with Nebraska, allow for electors to be elected on a congressional district basis rather than winnertakeall. Under this scenario, 270 Republican electors would be elected, a bare majority, while 268 Democrat electors would be elected. Notice I did not say Trump would get 270 electoral votes, which is what we are used to hearing. The fact is that the electoral votes are not cast until December 19, and there is no guarantee that every single one of the 270 Republican electors would actually vote for Trump. Do you remember a few months ago how alarmed we were at the prospect of supposed Trump delegates to the Republican National Convention deserting Trump and voting for Cruz It was only that Trump piled up such large victories in the final primaries that he had big enough majority of delegates to cause the Never Trump people in the Republican establishment to give up on rigging the convention. So who are these electors Just as the method of electing the electors is left up to the states, the method for nominating the candidates for the electoral college is also left up to the states. Some states allow the presidential candidates to nominate their own slate of electors. Presumably, these people could be counted on to be loyal. But in other states the partys slate of electors is chosen at state party conventions and even electoral district conventions. As a young man I attended one such convention and had my name put into nomination as a Democratic elector. Myself and the other three contenders then made short speeches to the convention. The other three talked about being precinct captains or hardworking party volunteers. Then I gave a speech calling for the direct election of the president and the abolition of the electoral college. I got a huge round of applause. I would have easily won, but as a matter of principle I withdrew my name from nomination. The point of the story is that most of the electors are unknown to the public, typically cogs in the party apparatus, and not even necessarily highlevel ones, and some of them may even be smoothtalking slicksters like me, unknown to the party itself. So how likely is it that one or more Republican electors would betray Trump Such a person is known as a faithless elector, and while faithless electors have never ultimately altered the outcome of a presidential election, there have been 179 faithless electors in our history. In fact, faithless electors caused the Congress to have to decide the 1836 election for Vice President. It is true that about half the states have laws punishing faithless voters, but in all but a few states the votes of faithless electors would still count. The nightmare situation would be after a close election the Hillary people, or the Never Trump people, could bribe or pressure Republican electors, some of whom may not like Trump anyway, not to vote for Trump. They could vote for Hillary, they could vote for Pence, they could vote for anyone else, or they could even abstain from voting. Then what happens If enough Republican electors are cajoled into voting for Hillary in the above 270268 scenario, it would only require two, then Hillary gets inaugurated on January 20. If its a tie, then the House of Representatives breaks the tie. Obviously, there have been Republican members of the House that say they wont vote for Trump for president in November, so there is no reason to assume they would vote for him in January. However, not only are Republicans likely to retain a significant majority in the House, but the voting for president by the House is not one vote for each representative, but one vote per state. This means that California, which currently has 39 Democratic representatives, would get only one vote, while Alaskas single representative, who is a Republican, would also get one vote. This heavily favors the Republicans and means that if Hillary cannot flip enough Republican electors to herself to win a majority of the electoral votes, she is finished. There is no real prospect of the House of Representative electing Hillary. But what if enough Republican electors vote for other people, Paul Ryan for example, so that no candidate gets a majority Then the House of Representatives gets to choose between the top three vote finishers in the electoral college vote. You could get a coalition between Democrats and Republican defectors that would deny Trump the presidency and give it to someone like Ryan. The same applies in the case that Mormon exCIA operative and neverTrump independent presidential candidate Evan McMullen wins Utah , which some polls predict is possible. While none of the above scenarios may come to pass, we do have to face the fact that the establishment has so far stopped at nothing to try to defeat Trump, and so it is not too far fetched to think that they would try these tactics, especially if the November 8 voting produces a very narrow victory for Trump. The media could start inventing more reasons why Trump is uniquely unfit to become president and claim that the Constitution allows for these scenarios which is the case, and that this in fact was why the framers of the Constitution created the Electoral College which is not the case. It would then be incumbent on us to make it clear to the members of the Electoral College and the Congress that any violation of the peoples will would not be tolerated.",hate

"30 Views Share Dr. David Duke offers a New Paradigm for Humanity. Read and listen to this amazing statement that will create a revolution in the concept of Human Rights. A recognition of the absolute right of every people to preserve its Human diversity, independence and freedom. The right of every people to preserve its culture, traditions, art forms and characteristics of society. A path to peace and harmonious nations and societies. Why we must resist Globalist destruction of freedom, Globalist forms of economic and financial slavery, and Globalist, Zionist wars. In the power of its reason, love and understanding, this declaration of Human Diversity and Freedom can be the moral engine to saving our European heritage and truly the rights of every people on Earth The Foundation of Human Freedom I believe that each of us must be committed to the preservation of Human diversity. I cherish not only the value of every form of life on Earth in what we call biodiversity, but also respect and honor the diversity of Mankind. I believe that every people has the right to preserve their expression of Humanity, its own heritage and culture. That every people on earth has the right rule themselves and the right to be free and independent. Human freedom is the principle that all peoples must be free to be different. Humanity is not one, it is many. Destroying the variety, diversity and freedom of a diverse Humanity is a destruction of Humanity itself. Not recognizing the inborn urge of every people to express their essence in their own forms of art, music, culture, religion, societal structure and government, leads to Human conflict and often to violence and Human suffering on a horrific scale. Much of the worlds conflicts are not because peoples and cultures are different, but because they are not allowed to be different because Globalists and imperialists seek to expand their empires. They want to control the resources and economy of all nations and destroy real Human diversity. Human differences in values, cultures, economies, religions and their freedom and independence to preserve and celebrated those differences stand in the way of the Globalists who want to regiment mankind and make them soulless consumers. Human Diversity is natural Human life is expressed in a multitude of diverse peoples created by geographic and social adaption over the course of thousands of years. Whether we celebrate Human diversity as the handiwork of Nature or in a religious sense as the creation of God, we celebrate the rich tapestry of different peoples and cultures across the Earth. We believe that every people and culture has the right to preserve its unique expression of Humanity, that every people has the right to maintain and enrich its unique culture, to nurture its particular expressions of art, music, literature, philosophies, architecture, religion, diet, traditions and values that make every people unique and add beauty and possibility for Mankind. We believe that every people has the right to be politically free and independent, and not be ruled over or exploited by any other people or nation. And we reject the Globalist power that seeks to destroy the independence and freedom of every people and destroy Human diversity. Every people must have the right to self preservation and freedom We believe that every free people has the right to live in a harmonious society created in its own image, its own nature and spirit. For example, the people of Tibet have the Human right to live in a society oriented to the heritage, culture and tradition of that nation, as should all peoples. Today the Tibetan people are threatened by massive nonTibetan immigration forced by an imperial power meant to marginalize the heritage and culture of Tibetan people in their own homeland. The loss of the unique people and culture of Tibet is a horrific loss for them and truly a loss for all of Humanity. What is true for Tibet and the Tibetan people is true for every people on Earth. We believe that the people of Tibet and every nation have the right to defend their borders, and an inherent Human right to preserve its unique ethnic and cultural character, and its freedom and independence. Nations more similar in their cultural, ethnic, religious and social traditions are tend to be far more harmonious that those wracked with internal cultural, ethnic or religious divisions. We also affirm that states with significant ethnic and cultural minorities tend to be more happy, peaceful and cooperative when each group has the freedom to an autonomy that makes each group feel more at home in society. If one looks honestly at the world, he quickly recognizes that the greatest source of civil conflict, hatreds, wars, genocide and other horrific Human rights violations comes from ethnic conflict, often accompanied by religious conflict. And when that happens it is like putting a fuse into dynamite. It is a truism that if you want to reduce ethnic conflict, you must endeavor to give every people the Human right to live and to create society and community in its own values and, that every group respect the right of every other group to do this. We believe that these endemic conflicts are rooted in supranational states and globalist denial of the reality of Human diversity and denial of the natural Human desire of people to live in a society reflecting their own heritage, traditions, culture and values. One size does not fit all. Instead of recognizing this reality, the globalists and empire builders seek to destroy the distinctions of Humanity so they will become more compliant to their control and exploitation. Instead of accepting the reality of Human nature and truly the diversity of all life, including Human life, the globalists continue to promote destructive policies that destroy the harmony of traditional societies and historical character of nations. Massive immigration of diverse peoples into another peoples living space produces conflict not harmony We believe that massive forced immigration of nonindigenous people into other peoples lands is almost always against the will of the indigenous people. And this leads to civil repression, conflict, hatreds, violence. One does not have to look much further than the Palestinian Nakba, or the massive immigration into Tibet as examples of this universal truth, but this reality is just as true in Europe and other areas of the world that have undergone massive immigration into it regions and nation states. Look at the riots and deep social unrest and conflict that have befallen traditional harmonious societies that have experienced massive, unwanted immigration. A world of independent cultures is true diversity and freedom. A multicultural state does not contribute to Human diversity. It does not contribute to Human happiness, peace and harmony. It more often than not lessens Human love and Human rights. No matter what the high motive, it produces more disharmony than harmony, more discord than accord. Just as in the natural world every life form needs its own living space, and needs the preservation of its own ecosystem to survive and flourish, so it is true for every people of Humanity. Every people needs a living space and ecocultural system in which it can thrive. Ignoring this reality leads to conflict. Diverse Human peoples and cultures and religions competing in a limited living space is the greatest single cause of civil war and crimes against Humanity. United Nations studies show ethnic, cultural and religious conflicts within nations are the primary engines of civil conflict and war which takes an enormous toll in Human suffering, numbering hundreds of millions of dead, injured, and dispossessed Human beings. This urge to diversity has always been in Mankind, and always will be. Not to recognize this elemental part of mankinds Nature is the progenitor of conflict. In fact, with the rise of the idea that people have the right to be free, ethnic conflict is increasing as the imperial states created by conquest can no longer repress the desire of diverse people for their freedom and ethnic expression. Nations whose rulers have established immigration policies ignoring Human differences are increasingly divided and conflicted. Trying to change the natural urge toward freedom is like screaming against the tide The global elite in government and media which has a huge stake in trying to regiment the worlds populations, tell us we are all the same and they endeavor to destroy every unique culture and Human expression . They attempt to change Human nature, but history and an increasingly conflicted world show that this is like screaming against the tide. Better to recognize Human nature, and within that context support national and regional freedom that lessons conflict and supports mutual respect. It is time to teach the new ethic that recognizes the Human right of every people to exist and thrive. However, those who seek their own peoples freedom must understand that these rights must be afforded to every people. And any effort toward this worthy goal must be in the spirit of not destroying the rights of others and to peaceful resolution of the conflicts. It is far better to recognize these realities and inherent desires of Humanity and avoid as much Human conflict as possible, than to try to destroy Human distinctions in pursuit of imperialist empire or globalist regimentation and conformity. Even if the destruction of peoples is based on a utopian vision, because it goes against basic human nature it ultimately leads not to a dreamed of peace and love between people but to conflict and hate. Attempts to control, exploit or harm any people is a crime against Humanity We must condemn violence and the harming or destruction of any people. We must adopt a clear Human ethic that attempts to control or exploit any other nation or people is a crime against Humanity. We support Human freedom and we support Human diversity and we support the right of every people to have their own nation or society, but we do not support supremacism, control or repression of any other people. Efforts to control or exploit is a crime against Humanity. As a person of European descent I see that much of the repressive globalism damaging the world originates in mostly European peopled nations that are today called the West. I see that this globalism not only damages and harms the worlds diversity of peoples but that it harms my own people. And I have learned that we must not allow this exploitation of our own heritage and be just as committed to the well being of all of humanity. This is a lifechanging lesson that I have learned in my own life. As a very young man I joined a nonviolent Klan organization in my community. Like so many young people across the world, I longed to identify with my own people, to defend the heritage that I love and that I believed was threatened. But still as a young man I left the organization because I came to realize I have no moral right to speak about Human rights for my own people unless I embrace the idea of the same Human rights for every people, and further, that we must be committed to securing Human rights, not with war, not with violence, not with Human suppression but the power of human ideas and ideals. I believe that the vast majority of the earths people believe in the principles I set forth here. In my own life I further realized that other peoples have the same the desires for their own peoples heritage and rights that I have for mine. I realize fully that only in a context of genuine commitment to respect the rights and freedoms of all Humanity, can one morally campaign for your own peoples fundamental rights. Defending the Diversity of Humanity is a defense of Humanity itself There is nothing wrong with a people defending their own rights and heritage. In fact defending and preserving the diversity of Humanity is defense of Humanity itself. But, it must come with a genuine concern for the rights and heritage of all. In that context and only with that understanding, can we move toward peaceful resolutions of social, religious and ethnic conflicts and at the same time preserve our own heritage and the diversity and freedom of Humanity. Nations that have an overwhelmingly unifying heritage, culture, religious and social tradition have the right to preserve their expression of Humanity and their societal harmony. It is a crime to destroy those values in pursuit of socalled multiculturalism. And if one wants to see where massive immigration of alien peoples, cultures and religions lead, just look to what happened in the warravaged now dismembered nation once called Yugoslavia, look to the cultural and ethnic genocide in Tibet, look to the tribal and religious conflicts in many nations of the Mideast. Group differences run deep. Even though the Muslim Quran repeatedly teaches Muslim unity, still some extremist elements of Shiites and Sunnis blow up the children of each other in the others holy places of worship. Nor did the admonitions of Jesus Christ against violence and for love and reconciliation stop Irish Catholics and Scottishderived Protestants from a cascade of violence that has lead to the death of countless innocents. Although we understand the historical motives of mass immigration of one people into another peoples lands, we must not continue to repeat those mistakes in the modern world and create more divided and strifetorn communities, regions and nations. Models of self rule and societal harmony And just as a majority has the Human right to live in a social fabric in harmony with its history and values, so minorities must be accorded their Human right to have their own communities or regions that reflect their own essence, or helped to migrate to a sovereign region of compatriots. This is Human freedom and this is Human rights on the most fundamental level. Those nations with significant minorities of diverse people should strive toward recognizing their desire for freedom and self expression. Autonomy within nations, such as the German language speaking South Tyrol region of North Italy and the Italian, French and Germanspeaking Cantons of Switzerland offer models of how recognition of differences in language, heritage, ethnicity and a liberal degree of autonomy can lead to a more peaceful national fabric. Nation states that seek imperial power through the conquering and subjection of other peoples are now coming apart at the seams because of the inherent will to freedom and identity that grow in suppressed people. Even European nations divided by slight differences in history, identity, genetics and culture, seek this freedom. The artificially created nation of Czechoslovakia was composed of Czechs and Slovaks held together by 50 years of intense totalitarian physical suppression, propaganda and conditioning. When the communist tyranny collapsed they used their new freedom to create the independent states of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. They did this with mutual respect and not war, and without horrific crimes against Humanity. Contrast that to the artificially created state of Yugoslavia created in name of empire, and then held together under a ruthless authoritarian regime. When Communism fell, people wedded to old ideas of empire tried desperately to hold on to control over vast areas of diverse peoples. As a result, a long war and brutality and massive crimes against Humanity occurred on both sides of the conflict. How much better if all parties in the conflict had embraced the ethic that all people have a right to self rule and self expression in their own regions. Take for example two of the many peoples trapped in the old Yugoslavia, the Serbians and the Croatians. Even though Serbians may have dominated the government of Yugoslavia, to effectively control other peoples such a totalitarian state must suppress the natural differences in people and force a regimentation and conformity. So even the Serbian people lost some of their unique identity as well as the other peoples over whom they ruled. People now warmly embrace the right of Serbians and Croatians to be themselves and rule themselves. Globalism is a continuation of Yugoslavian totalitarianism on a global scale Ironically, the Serbians and the Croatians and indeed all of us, face globalist tyrants demanding to control the economy of Serbia and Croatia, their currencies, controlled by New York and London rather than by their own people, and increasingly they are subject to a media controlled by Hollywood and New York rather than the spirit of their own traditional heritage and values. And in the height of insanity, the Globalists are eyeing mass immigration into both Serbia and Croatia of massive numbers of nonEuropean immigrants who are far more fundamentally different than Serbs and Croats. A prescription for future Human conflict. The rights of both majorities and minorities There are many harmonious nations on earth that are overwhelmingly of one primary heritage, with only minor differences among their inhabitants. But, nations corrupted by the globalist power and media elite, and propagandized that Humanity is one and not many go against the peoples will and usher in massive immigration of an alien population. This process is almost always against the democratic will of the nations inhabitants as history repeatedly shows. And then as the numbers increase and societal differences and conflicts and discord increase, the globalists resort to the old totalitarian tactics of suppressing free speech, free association, and all kinds of Human liberty, even to the point of forbidding the public displays of the traditional culture of the vast majority. A powerful example is how the American government has now made it illegal to display a Christian Christmas motif on public ground, even in an overwhelmingly Christian cultural nation. America supposedly created by e pluribus unum out of the many, one is now dominated by identity and ethnic politics. The most powerful lobby in American politics by far is, for instance, the Jewish Lobby, comprised of an ethnic group of two percent of the American people but driven by ethnic and religious supremacism. Jewish organizations lead the fight in the destruction of Christian Christmas traditions. The political landscape of America is dominated by special interest groups to which every politician must now bow, except of course the European American majority which must silently watch as its cultural traditions, such as Christmas are destroyed. Of course, it goes far beyond Christmas. Americans are experiencing increasing identity politics and division such as generated by massive illegal immigration. The rights of small nations cannot be sacrificed On the international level it must be recognized as a crime against Humanity for any imperial state to occupy another peoples lands for exploitation of its labor or resources. Where autonomy or independent regions are not possible, a degree of autonomy is certainly possible where significant groups in an area can have community institutions, schools and other structures oriented toward both their needs and their spirit. It is time to stand for freedom for all peoples. It is time to stand up to Globalist destruction of biodiversity, destruction of Human diversity, destruction of the earths indigenous cultures, artistic expressions, lifestyles, traditions and independence. Zionist Globalism is actually supremacism The globalists seek the destruction of every unique expression of Humanity. They want to destroy the unique character of your people and every people on the earth. They seek to destroy the Human diversity of the earth so they can more easily rule over all of us, and market the same brands of junk movies, media and music. They want you and all of us to consume the same junk food from a world agribusiness and media that advertises it, that not only destroys the planets ecosystems, but destroys your health and the health of hundreds of millions of people spawning epidemics of obesity, heart disease, diabetes and other ills. They want to control the value of the currency in your pocket, and force you and your nation under a corrupt Zionistcontrolled global banking system that exploits you and all of us and put whole nations and peoples as slaves in a perpetual debt. They want to put you and all of us under a soulless, Globalist government that takes away your freedom and that of every people and every nation. And these globalists want war, perpetual wars and conflicts in their attempts to expand their power over the earth and over all people. They grow stronger by divide and conquer tactics, and they seek to stamp out Human diversity and seek to regiment all of Humanity to their New World Order all while the New York centered Globalist media supports Israel as a quote Jewish State, and supports Zionist control of the International Banks and the Globalist media. So in reality, ZionistDriven Globalism is actually form of Jewish supremacism. Globalism is Imperialism on a global level, and the greatest threat to human freedom, diversity and independence in all of world history. Yes to Freedom, yes to Diversity and Independence But, my dear friends all over the world, in my homeland of America and that of my brethren in Europe, but among all freedom loving people across the globe, millions of us say no to globalism. We say yes to freedom, yes to Human diversity and independence. We say no to globalist wars such as the Iraq War, the Afghanistan War, the planned war on Iran, horrific wars that are part of the Zionist, Globalist agenda. We say no to the Zionist dominated Globalist media that spout the lies that fuel these wars. We say yes to a free Internet and the freedom of people create their own media, literature, music and art forms. No longer will we drink the toxic poisons of the Globalist elite. We say no to Globalism, yes to Human freedom, yes to Human diversity, yes to world of peace and prosperity. We say yes to every peoples striving to preserve their way of life, their particular heritage, their particular expression of Humanity. Whether we are Kurds, or Pakistanis, or Iranians or Palestinians. Whether we are Chinese, or Japanese, or Africans or Indians or of European heritage, we say no to globalism. We say yes to Human Freedom and Global Diversity. We say yes to the peoples of our own nations and societies determining our destiny. We say no to the Global corporations and huge imperial powers wiping out Human diversity in pursuit of their ungodly power. We say yes to preserving our heritage and our way of life, yes to our independence and freedom no matter who we are or where we live upon the earth. We are Humanity. We are many. Because we honor our own heritage and traditions, we honor every heritage and tradition. Because we value our own freedom and independence we value the freedom and independence of every people on Earth. Because we refuse to be economically exploited we pledge not to exploit other s. Just as most Europeans now want to preserve their own heritage and cultures, we refuse to support the Globalists who seek to use us to control and exploit other nations around the world. Because we love peace, we refuse to support their Zionistdriven globalist wars. A New Paradigm of Human Rights This is a new affirmation of Human rights, a new paradigm. It is the Human freedom movement and it is found wherever there are free people who desire to preserve their heritage and freedom. It is found where people yearn for Human societies allowed to be as naturally diverse as the biodiversity in Nature. The Globalists have global economic, media political and military power. But we represent the true desires of Humanity for freedom. We represent the natural desires of every majority population to want to preserve the character of their nation and people, and every minority population who seeks more freedom and autonomy in their own communities or regions. Human Diversity, Freedom and Independence We must resist rule of the Globalists over us with a Global coalition of mutually free peoples. We are rising in every nation. Our Paradigm for Human Freedom and Diversity is growing among people all over the world. The Globalists cannot rule over us without our consent. They cannot defeat us if we rise in defense of Human freedom and diversity, not just for ourselves but as a new principle for all Mankind, good for all people on this planet. The principles we stand for we hold, for our own people and for every people on the face the Earth. This is the world I am committed to, the Humanity I am committed to, the nation in my own land that I am committed to. I hope you join me in this quest for a new paradigm for Humanity, a new commitment to Human freedom and diversity.

"Editorial by Dr. David Duke  Trump appoints men who will take America back Presidentelect Donald Trumps appointment of Bannon Flynn, and Sessions are the first steps in the long and arduous project of taking America back. Trump Chief Strategist Bannon has repeatedly exposed the vicious war on White people on his Breitbart website. National Security Head Flynn realizes that Americas foreign policy has been downright traitorous with the support of the radical Jihadists of Saudi Arabia, over our natural allies the Christian, Muslim and moderate secularists of Syria. He also understands that Putin of Christian Russia should not be our enemy but our ally. He is an avowed enemy of the Jewish warmonger traitors called Neocons and they in turn intensely hate this U.S. Army General who truly puts America First. Attorney General Sessions has been hated for years by the Jewishdominated media for his opposition to massive immigration into America and for the fact that he has dared to publicly oppose the massive, institutionalized racial discrimination against white people called affirmative action. During his U.S. Senate confirmation hearings Senators should demand that he expose the blatant media and political blather of equal rights and opportunity when white people face massive racial discrimination as well as a media hate campaign against the people whose ancestors created America We must demand the protection of the civil rights of all Americans including white people Everyone must be judged on their merit and not the unfair and destructive antiwhite affirmative action racist policies that dominate major corporations, Federal, State, and city governments, colleges and educational institutions.

"360 Views Share By Dr. David Duke. When I was first began to understand the ultraracist, supremacist ideology of Judaism and Zionism, I came into contact with the theory that presentday Jews are genetically unrelated to the historical Jewish community. The allegation, known as the Khazar theory, claims that the Ashkenazim Jews of today are actually the descendants of the Khazar people, a Central Asiatic nomadic tribe that allegedly converted to Judaism in the 9th Century AD. It is claimed that these newlyminted Jews then migrated into what is now Russia, Eastern Europe and later Western and Northern Europe. The theory is also used to advance the idea that Jewish actions are character are not genetic or racial because the Khazar people adopted the Talmudic values of Shephardic and other Jews who were unrelated to them. Interestingly enough, the Khazar theory was launched, and is still to this day, driven primarily by Communist Jews and other Jews who promote it in the Gentile community as a refutation that the Jews cant be racist because they are not a race It is ironic that the three most prominent exponents of the theory that the Jews are not a race all have almost exaggerated caricatures of features people ascribe as Jewish. Above, left to right Zionist extremist and Communist Party member Arthur Koestler author of the The Thirteenth Tribe Jewish geneticist Eran Elhaik and Shlomo Sand, an Israeli academic and former member of the Union of Israeli Communist Youth Banki. All three maintain that large numbers of presentday Jews are completely genetically unrelated to the Middle Easternorigin Jews who wrote the Babylonian Talmud. For years I accepted the Khazar theory as true. After it, all it was repeated by some writers who also recognized the leading Jewish role in Communism and their leadership in many other subversive movements. It was only later, when I considered the question logically and scientifically, were my doubts about the Khazar theory aroused. One thing that I did not know then was that Koestler, the communist Jew who popularized the Khazar Theory bragged in a Jewish magazine that he advanced the theory as way to fight against antiSemitism. His theory was that since the Gospels and Europeans blamed Jews for the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, if he could make Europeans believe that they are not related by blood to the Christkiller Jews talked about in the New Testament that he could lessen hatred against Jews. One must remember until the Jewish triumph of Christian Zionism 99 percent of Christianity viewed Jews as the greatest enemies of Jesus Christ and God, as the New Testament makes very, very clear. So in those days some Jews, such as Koestler saw an advantage to say that the Jews were not actually related to the Jews who crucified Christ and so persecuted Christians. Koestlers official biography, written by Michael Scammell, specifically quotes him on why he wrote The Thirteenth Tribe . His argument was that if he could persuade people that a nonJewish Khazar heritage formed the basis of modern Jews, then this would be a weapon against European raciallybased antiSemitism. Should this theory be confirmed, the term antiSemitism would become void of meaning, he said. According to Scammell, Koestler told French biologist Pierre DebrayRitzen he was convinced that if he could prove that the bulk of Eastern European Jews were descended from the Khazars, the racial basis for antiSemitism would be removed and antiSemitism itself could disappear. Source Scammell, Michael. Koestler The Literary and Political Odyssey of a TwentiethCentury Skeptic, Random House, 2009, ISBN 9780394576305, p. 546. In the 1950s the Khazar Theory was also promoted by Benjamin Friedman, a prominent rich Jew who converted to Christianity and turned against the Jews. It was certainly selfserving for him to promote the idea that Jewishness was mostly cultural and religious and not racial in nature therefore facilitating more acceptance of him. There are three fundamental issues which need to addressed the scientific evidence thehistoricallogical evidence and the reasons why the Khazar theory came about. Part I The Scientific EvidenceTwelve DNA Studies Which Disprove the Khazar Theory 1. A 1999 study titled Jewish and Middle Eastern nonJewish populations share a common pool of Ychromosome biallelic haplotypes  M.F. Hammer et.al, Proceedings of the US National Academy of Sciences 67696774, doi 10.1073/pnas.100115997  found that Despite their longterm residence in different countries and isolation from one another, most Jewish populations were not significantly different from one another at the genetic level. Admixture estimates suggested low levels of European Ychromosome gene flow into Ashkenazi and Roman Jewish communities . . . Jewish and Middle Eastern nonJewish populations were not statistically different. The results support the hypothesis that the paternal gene pools of Jewish communities from Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East descended from a common Middle Eastern ancestral population, and suggest that most Jewish communities have remained relatively isolated from neighboring nonJewish communities during and after the Diaspora. 2. A November 2001 study titled The Y Chromosome Pool of Jews as Part of the Genetic Landscape of the Middle East  Almut Nebel et. al., American Journal of Human Genetics, Nov 2001 695 10951112  found that in most Jewish populations, male line ancestors appear to have been mainly Middle Eastern. The study found that Ashkenazi Jews in particular share more common paternal lineages with other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than with nonJewish populations in areas where Jews lived in Eastern Europe, Germany and the French Rhine Valley. This is consistent with Jewish traditions in placing most Jewish paternal origins in the region of the Middle East. 3. A September 2006 study titled European Population Substructure Clustering of Northern and Southern Populations  Michael F Seldin et.al., PLOS Genetics, DOI 0.1371/journal.pgen.0020143  found that both Ashkenazi Jews as well as Sephardic Jews showed more than 85 membership in the southern European group which made their results consistent with a later Mediterranean origin of these ethnic groups. 4. An April 2008 study titled Counting the Founders The Matrilineal Genetic Ancestry of the Jewish Diaspora  Doron M. Behar et.al., PLoS ONE. 2008 34 e2062. doi 10.1371/journal.pone.0002062  found that about 40 of Ashkenazi Jews originate maternally from just four female founders, who were of Middle Eastern origin. 5. A January 2009 study titled A genomewide genetic signature of Jewish ancestry perfectly separates individuals with and without full Jewish ancestry in a large random sample of European Americans  Anna C Need et.al., Genome Biology, 2009 101 R7. doi 10.1186/gb2009101r7  found that individuals with full Jewish ancestry formed a clearly distinct cluster from those individuals with no Jewish ancestry. This study showed that in DNA terms, Jews, both Sephardic and Ashkenazim, cluster as a distinct groupsomething that, if the Khazar theory was true, would be impossible. 6. A December 2009 study titled Genomic microsatellites identify shared Jewish ancestry intermediate between Middle Eastern and European populations  Naama M Kopelman et.al., BMC Genetics. 2009 10 80. doi 10.1186/147121561080  found that  Jewish populations show a high level of genetic similarity to each other, clustering together in several types of analysis of population structure. These results support the view that the Jewish populations largely share a common Middle Eastern ancestry and that over their history they have undergone varying degrees of admixture with nonJewish populations of European descent. 7. A December 2009 study titled The genomewide structure of the Jewish people  Doron M. Behar, et. al., Nature 466, 238242 08 July 2010 doi10.1038/nature09103  analyzed individuals from 14 Jewish Diaspora communities and compare these patterns of genomewide diversity with those from 69 Old World nonJewish populations in order to provide comprehensive comparisons between Jewish and nonJewish populations in the Diaspora, as well as with nonJewish populations from the Middle East and north Africa. The results identified a previously unrecognized genetic substructure within the Middle East and that Most Jewish samples form a remarkably tight subcluster, and that traces the origins of most Jewish Diaspora communities to the Levant. 8. A June 2010 study titled Abrahams children in the genome era major Jewish diaspora populations comprise distinct genetic clusters with shared Middle Eastern ancestry  Atzmon et al., American Journal of Human Genetics, 201086850859  refuted the idea of largescale genetic contributions of Central and Eastern European and Slavic populations to the formation of Ashkenazi Jewry. This study found used genomewide analysis of seven Jewish groups Iranian, Iraqi, Syrian, Italian, Turkish, Greek, and Ashkenazi and demonstrated distinctive Jewish population clusters, each with shared Middle Eastern ancestry, proximity to contemporary Middle Eastern populations, and variable degrees of European and North African admixture. This paper specifically excluded the Khazar theory as an origin for presentday Jews, saying the genetic proximity . . . is incompatible with theories that Ashkenazi Jews are for the most part the direct lineal descendants of converted Khazars or Slavs. 9. A March 2012 study by Steven M. Bray et. al., titled Signatures of founder effects, admixture, and selection in the Ashkenazi Jewish population  Proceedings of the US National Academy of Sciences, 1622216227, doi 10.1073/pnas.1004381107  found that the Ashkenazi Jewish AJ population . . . has a common Middle Eastern origin with other Jewish Diaspora populations while concluding that the Ashkenazi Jewish population has had the most European admixture. 10. A March 2012 study by Christopher L. Campbell et. al., titled North African Jewish and nonJewish populations form distinctive, orthogonal clusters  Proceedings of the US National Academy of Sciences, doi 10.1073/pnas.1204840109  found that genomewide analysis of five North African Jewish groups Moroccan, Algerian, Tunisian, Djerban, and Libyan demonstrated distinctive North African Jewish population clusters with proximity to other Jewish populations. Furthermore, the study showed, the Sephardic Jewish genome is compatible with the history of North African Jewsfounding during Classical Antiquity with proselytism of local populations, followed by genetic isolation with the rise of Christianity and then Islam, and admixture following the emigration of Sephardic Jews during the Inquisition. Finally, this study added  These populations showed a high degree of endogamy and were part of a larger Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jewish group. Endogamy the practice of marrying within a specific ethnic group, rejecting others on such a basis as being unsuitable for marriage or for other close personal relationships. 11. In his book, Legacy A Genetic History of the Jewish People Oxford University Press, USA May 2012, Harry Ostrer, a professor of Pathology and Genetics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University and Director of Genetic and Genomic Testing at Montefiore Medical Center, Medicine, concluded that Jews exhibit a distinctive genetic signature.  Jews Are a Race, Genes RevealAuthor Uncovers DNA Links Between Members of Tribe, The Jewish Daily Forward, May 04, 2012 . Ostrer, who is also director of genetic and genomic testing at Montefiore Medical Center, said in his conclusion that Jews are a homogeneous group with all the scientific trappings of what we used to call a race. Ostrer also deals specifically with the Khazar theory. He pointed out that the findings from the Jewish HapMap Project see below completely refute the theories that Ashkenazi Jews are the descendants of converted Khazars or Slavs.  Jews A religious group, people or race, Jerusalem Post, 8/26/2012  12. The Jewish HapMap Project , a joint project of Albert Einstein College of Medicine and New York University School of Medicine, was created to understand the structure of the genomes in Jewish populations and is an outgrowth of the Human HapMap Project. According to this project, Jewish populations are remarkable for maintaining continuous genetic, cultural, and religious traditions over 4000 years, despite residence all over the world. Its findings, based on first hand DNA studies amongst Jewish populations around the globe, found no evidence to support a Central Asian DNA origin for Jewry. According to the Jerusalem Post, the Jewish HapMap Project in New York City has so far shown in exquisite detail what had been conjectured for a century. Jewish populations from the major Jewish Diaspora groups  Ashkenazi, Sephardic and Mizrahi  form a distinctive population cluster that is closely related to Semitic and European populations. Within this larger Jewish cluster, each of the Jewish populations formed its own subcluster. A high degree of mixing of Ashkenazi, Sephardi, Italian and Syrian Jews caused them to become more closely related to each other than they were to Middle Eastern, Iraqi and Iranian Jews. This genetic split seemed to have occurred about 2,500 years ago.  Jews A religious group, people or race, Jerusalem Post, 8/26/2012  DNA Studies Find that Ashkenazim Jews have 30 European Admixture Both the Behar study section 7 above and the Atzmon study section 8 above were commented upon by the British former deputy editor of the journal Nature , and currently the scientific correspondent for the N ew York Times , Nicholas Wade, in an article in that newspaper as follows Jewish communities in Europe and the Middle East share many genes inherited from the ancestral Jewish population that lived in the Middle East some 3,000 years ago, even though each community also carries genes from other sources  usually the country in which it lives, adding that a major surprise from both surveys is the genetic closeness of the two Jewish communities of Europe, the Ashkenazim and the Sephardim. Wade pointed out that the two studies refute the suggestion made by the historian Shlomo Sand in his book The Invention of the Jewish People that Jews have no common origin but are a miscellany of people in Europe and Central Asia who converted to Judaism at various times. Jewish communities from Europe, the Middle East and the Caucasus all have substantial genetic ancestry that traces back to the Levant Ethiopian Jews and two Judaic communities in India are genetically much closer to their host populations, Wade wrote. The shared genetic elements suggest that members of any Jewish community are related to one another as closely as are fourth or fifth cousins in a large population, which is about 10 times higher than the relationship between two people chosen at random off the streets of New York City. Ashkenazic and Sephardic Jews have roughly 30 percent European ancestry, with most of the rest from the Middle East, the two surveys find. The two communities seem very similar to each other genetically, which is unexpected because they have been separated for so long.  Studies Show Jews Genetic Similarity, Nicholas Wade, New York Times, June 9, 2010 . Eran Elhaiks Single Study Attempts to Refute the Mass of Earlier DNA Evidence The mass of DNA and genetic evidence is, therefore, overwhelmingly indicative that, despite a certain amount of European admixture among Ashkenazim Jewry, there is still a clearly definable Middle Eastern genetic component to both Ashkenazim and Sephardic Jewry. Despite all of these studiesand many more, too numerous to list individually herein December 2012, a single individual by the name of Eran Elhaik, from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, attempted to refute all of the above mentioned evidence. His paper, titled The Missing Link of Jewish European Ancestry Contrasting the Rhineland and the Khazarian Hypotheses was published in the journal Genome Biological Evolution  2013 5 16174.doi 10.1093/gbe/evs119 . In a nutshell, Elhaikwhose rather obviously Jewish physical appearance should by itself indicate that there is indeed a common Jewish type how else can many Jews be physically recognized as Jewsargues that his method of doing comparative studies between presentday Central Asian populations, Ashkenazim Jews and nonJewish test groups, proves that Ashkenazim Jews are a hotchpotch of genetic origins, with a strong link to what he identifies as the Khazar tribe. Even though Elhaiks work is the only single paper as opposed to literally dozens of opposing DNA studies, written by a single Jewish individual as opposed to the other papers which were written by dozens and dozens of scientists from around the globe, Jewish and nonJewish alike, it has quickly become the mostquoted proof of the Khazar Theory. Critical Errors in Elhaiks Paper Elhaiks paper has a number of errors, some small and a number of major ones. But they are all serious, because even the small errors cast doubt on his academic ability and motivation. For example, his paper discusses in detail what he sees as the geographic origin of the Khazarsyet he completely misidentifies the geographic location of one of his test sample groups, the Mbuti and Biaka Pygmies. These two groups, Elhaik asserts at least twice, are to be found in South Africa. Actually, the Mbuti and Biaka Pygmies are nowhere near South Africa, and are only to be found literally half a continent away, in the Congo. While this may seem a small error, it does indicate sloppiness in research which certainly does not bode well for the rest of the paper. This sloppiness is again repeated when Elhaik asserts that Eastern and Central European Jews account for approximately 90 of over 13 million worldwide Jews. In reality, the figure is far less. Of the estimated 13 million Jews worldwide, 8 million are Ashkenazim and 5 million are Sephardic, a division of 61 European Jews to 39 nonEuropean Jews. And it should be pointed out that the Zionist State of Israel actually has a Sephardic and Mizrahi nonAshkenazi Jewish majority among Jews. These actual facts on Jewish ethnicity are readily available, and Elhaiks motivation for making this clearly false claim could only be ascribed to a desire to underscore his general assertion, namely that most Jews are not Middle Eastern in origin and that Jews are not race, or a genetically similar people. The most important error in Elhaiks paper, however, is actually openly admitted namely that there is actually no Khazar DNA in existence, against which any sort of measurement can be taken. Elhaik himself admits this in his paper the Khazars have been vanquished and their remains have yet to be sequenced. . . in other words there is no record of what exactly Khazar DNA might have been. As there is no record of what Khazar DNA isit is, ipso facto, physically impossible to determine who is descended from it and who is not. Elhaik attempts to circumvent this major problem by selecting what he calls surrogate populationsin this case, contemporary Middle Eastern and Caucasus populations. Anyone with a basic understanding of historical events in the Caucasus in particular will immediately see that Elhaiks assertion that current populations in that region can be taken to reflect those of 1,500 years ago, is highly problematic and quite simply, unsustainable. The Caucasus, a region at the border of Europe and Asia, situated between the Black and the Caspian seas, has been crisscrossed by numerous peoples and races over the last 2000 years, ranging from IndoEuropeans, Semites, Mongols and othersand is today highly genetically diverse. A claim that DNA samples from this region can be taken as any sort of DNA yardstick, is dubious to say the very least. Finally, Elhaiks methodology in comparing the DNA samples is, to make an understatement, unique to him. As Marcus Feldman, director of Stanford Universitys Morrison Institute for Population and Resource Studies, said, He Elhaik appears to be applying the statistics in a way that gives him different results from what everybody else has obtained from essentially similar data.  Jews a Race Genetic Theory Comes Under Fierce Attack by DNA Expert. The Jewish Daily Forward, May 07, 2013  Interestingly, the study which was cited in the New York Times of the Jews as a race is exactly the same conclusion that was reached by German National Socialist anthropologists and other experts who studied race science in the United States and elsewhere. Also, many of the presentday extensive studies have been carried out by both Gentile and Jewish geneticists alike, obviating any claims of racial bias. Elhaiks theory is completely refuted by the new, most massive and most complete study ever done of the Jewish Genome One of Elhaiks arguments was that the previous studies referenced above were done in the pregenomewide era using uniparental markers and including different reference populationsimplying that their results are not in line with the most modern DNA sequencing methodology. In fact, at least one studywhich appeared after Elhaiks work was first publishedhas confirmed the accuracy of the original studies, and also completely refuted Elhaiks hypothesis. Titled No Evidence from GenomeWide Data of a Khazar Origin for the Ashkenazi Jews, this study was published by the journal Human Biology in August 2013 Behar, Doron M. et.al. Human Biology, Access PrePrints. Paper 41 , this paper emphasized the serious error with Elhaiks work Because the Khazar population has left no obvious modern descendants that could enable a clear test for a contribution to Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, the Khazar hypothesis has been difficult to examine using genetics. Furthermore, because only limited genetic data have been available from the Caucasus region, and because these data have been concentrated in populations that are genetically close to populations from the Middle East, the attribution of any signal of AshkenaziCaucasus genetic similarity to Khazar ancestry rather than shared ancestral Middle Eastern ancestry has been problematic. This latest, most massive study of the Jewish genome was a worldwide effort of geneticists, both Gentile and Jewish, to analyze Jewish genetics. Researchers from laboratories around the globe, including Estonia, Russia, Italy, Greece, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Armenia, the US, and Israel, gathered together the largest Jewish DNA data set ever yet assembled. The paper explained as follows Here, through integration of genotypes on newly collected samples with data from several of our past studies, we have assembled the largest data set available to date for assessment of Ashkenazi Jewish genetic origins. Employing a variety of standard techniques for the analysis of population genetic structure, we find that Ashkenazi Jews share the greatest genetic ancestry with other Jewish populations, and among nonJewish populations, with groups from Europe and the Middle East. No particular similarity of Ashkenazi Jews with populations from the Caucasus is evident, particularly with the populations that most closely represent the Khazar region. Thus, analysis of Ashkenazi Jews together with a large sample from the region of the Khazar Khaganate corroborates the earlier results that Ashkenazi Jews derive their ancestry primarily from populations of the Middle East and Europe, that they possess considerable shared ancestry with other Jewish populations, and that there is no indication of a significant genetic contribution either from within or from north of the Caucasus region. The latest, most uptodate and modern DNA analysis has, therefore, completely refuted the Khazar Theory. It is important to understand that this refutation has come from nonJewish and Jewish scientists from dozens of different universities and geneticists all over the world, and cannot be ascribed to a conspiracy. Part II The HistoricalLogical Evidence The Historical Record Shows Jewish Physical Consistency One of the most obvious indicators of genetic commonality is physical appearance. European people broadly resemble each other African people broadly resemble each other Chinese people broadly resemble each other Australian Aborigines broadly resemble each other and so on. It is a characteristic of genetically similar people to physically resemble each other. Jews are no different in this regard to any other people. They too show a resemblance to each otherthis is why it is possible to often recognize a Jewish person by his physical appearance. A good example in point is the already mentioned Jewish geneticist Eran Elhaik, who, despite physically embodying a Jewish sterrotype recognized around the world, tries to claim that there is no genetic commonality amongst Jews. The Khazar theory holds that most Ashkenazim Jews are not Semitic, but are Central Asian converts to Judaism. Proponents of the Khazar theory fail to understand the logical consequence of their beliefnamely that a supposed Central Asian origin of most Ashkenazim Jews means that they will not physically resemble other Jews. As anyone can see, this is not the case. Sephardic Jews are, on average, slightly darker than Ashkenazim Jews, but there is no doubt that there is a physical similarity which allows them still to be recognized as such. Above These two illustrations make the point even more dramatically. On the left, the Ashkenazim Jewess, Barbara Streisand, New York, 1966. On the right, a Jewish leader of Israelite trade delegation as portrayed on a mural on the wall of the 18th Dynasty 1400 BC Tomb of Sobekhotep, Thutmose IV Egypt. Two thousand years before the alleged Khazar conversion and they look the same as modern Ashkenazi Jews. Streisands paternal grandparents came from Galicia PolandUkraine and her maternal grandparents came from Russiaif anyone would be Khazar, according to that theory, it would be her. Nonetheless, she closely resembles the only designated Jew as portrayed on an Egyptian tomb from 3.400 years ago, the leader of a Jewish trade delegation to Egypt. The genetic continuity is clearand if the Khazar theory was true, there would be no physical similarity, because there would have been a racial sea change in Jewish appearance. Left The famous banker of Pompeii, Jucundus, who lived circa 2062 AD. 700 years before the alleged Ashkenazi conversion Identified as a Jew by the German anthropologist, Hans F.K. Gnther, in his book  Racial Elements of European History Fig, 240a and b, chapter VIII . Alongside, the Ashkenazi Jew, Abe Foxman of the ADL. The similarity between Jucundus and Foxman is clear, and serves a further indication of the physical continuity of the Jewish type over centuriessomething that would be impossible if the Khazar theory was true. In addition to genetic studies, there have been extensive physiological comparison of Jewish remains from burial sites from ancient Israel and presentday Ashkenazi and Sephardic physiology, all of which conclusively shows their similarity across both the Sephardic and Ashkenazi spectrumand their difference from European populations. Jewish Supremacist Behavior Through the Millennia Disprove the Khazar Theory Another piece of the jigsaw which disproves the Khazar theory, is that Jewish Supremacist behavior has remained constant throughout the millenniafrom biblical times right through to the present day. Most Christians are aware of the behavior of the Old Testament Jewswho burn, rampage, kill rape and enslave their way through Palestine supposedly on order of their tribal God. They are aware of the fact that the gospels of the New Testament show that elite of the Jews, the Pharisees, were the biggest enemies of Christ and arranged for his crucifixion, and the New Testament is clear that they led the persecution of Christians which has continued through both Jewish Bolshevism and the cultural assault in the Zio global media. It must also be clear that the Talmud, the books of Jewish law promoting Jewish extremist supremacism and hatred against all nonJews, was written hundreds of years before any alleged Khazar conversion. While it another debate altogether as to the historical accuracy of those events, there is no question about Jewish interaction with Gentilesand Romans in particularduring the first century AD. The worlds first antiJewish riots broke out in the city of Alexandria in 38 AD, and reoccurred in 66 AD, 115 AD, 118 AD, and 411 AD. In that year, the archbishop of Alexandria, Cyril, ordered the expulsion of all Jews from the city. The Roman historian Socrates of Constantinople not be confused with the Socrates of Classical Greece, in his Ecclesiastical History, recorded the reasons for this first great expulsion of Jews from a nonJewish city in detail, and reveals behavior by Jewish Supremacists exactly as the world experiences it today, over 1,500 years later . . .The Jews were continually factious and there was added to their ordinary hatred of the Christians . . . Cyril, on being informed of this, sent for the principal Jews, and threatened them with the utmost severities unless they desisted from their molestation of the Christians. These menaces, instead of suppressing their violence, only rendered the Jewish populace more furious, and led them to form conspiracies for the destruction of the Christians, one of which was of so desperate a character as to cause their entire expulsion from Alexandria Socrates, Hist. Eccl., VII, 13 PC, LXXXII, 759 ff. The very first Jewish community outside of the Middle East was established in Rome in 139 BCand it was not long before their activities roused Roman public opinion against them. The famous orator Cicero, among others, frequently spoke against the presence of Jews during sittings of the Roman senate. In his famous Pro Flacco oration which dealt with the case of a Roman aristocrat, Lucius Valerius Flaccus, accused of unlawfully confiscating Jewish money, Cicero said Now let us take a look at the Jews and their mania for gold. You chose this site, chief prosecutor Laelius, and the crowd which frequents it, with an eye to this particular accusation, knowing very well that Jews with their large numbers and tendency to act as a clique are valuable supporters to have at any kind of public meeting. Many other prominent and famous Romans, such as Seneca, Juneval, and Tacitus all went on record as complaining about the activities of Jews within the Roman Empire. The Roman historian Tacitus, in his most famous work, Histories, described the activities of the Jews as follows In order to secure the allegiance of his people in the future, Moses prescribed for them a novel religion quite different from those of the rest of mankind. Among the Jews all things are profane that we hold sacred on the other hand they regard as permissible what seems to us immoral . . . The other practices of the Jews are sinister and revolting, and have entrenched themselves by their very wickedness. Wretches of the most abandoned kind who had no use for the religion of their fathers took to contributing dues and freewill offerings to swell the Jewish exchequer and other reasons for their increasing wealth may be found in their stubborn loyalty and ready benevolence towards brother Jews. But the rest of the world they confront with the hatred reserved for enemies. They will not feed or intermarry with gentiles. Though a most lascivious people, the Jews avoid sexual intercourse with women of alien race. Among themselves nothing is barred. They have introduced the practice of circumcision to show that they are different from others. Tacitus, Histories, 5.25. The famous British historian Edward Gibbon, in his monumental work, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Lippincourt, Philadelphia, 1878, vol. 2, page 4, discussed Jewish Supremacist behavior in Roman times this way From the reign of Nero to that of Antoninus Pius, the Jews discovered a fierce impatience of the dominion of Rome, which repeatedly broke out in the most furious massacres and insurrections. Humanity is shocked at the recital of horrid cruelties which they committed in the cities of Egypt, of Cyria, and of Cyrene, where they dwelt in treacherous friendship with the unsuspecting natives and we are tempted to applaud the severe retaliation which was exercised by the arms of the Legions against a race of fanatics whose dire and credulous superstition seemed to render them the implacable enemies not only of the Roman government, but of all human kind. AntiJewish literature during Roman times was very widespread. One work by the Greek, Apion, was so wellknown that the Romanized Jewish historian Josephus who wrote the famous account of the Jewish uprising of 70 AD, called The Jewish Wars wrote an entire book trying to refute Apions arguments. The Roman Emperor Tiberius formally expelled the Jews from Rome in 19 AD. They returned shortly thereafter, only to be expelled once again in 49 AD. In 116 AD, Emperor Trajan ordered that all Jews in Mesopotamia should be killed, saying that they were the cause of continual uprisings in that region. One of the most famous emperors of the Eastern Roman Empire, Justinian 527565 AD, adopted a comprehensive antiJewish policy which barred Jews from the civil service, military posts, and any other positions of influence in his government. All of these events predate the supposed Khazar conversion by centuriesyet it can be seen that the identical behavioral patterns are on display before and after the supposed Khazar infusion. Logic dictates that if the racial makeup of Jews changed substantially after the year 700 AD, then their behavioral traits would also have changed. The fact that they did not, is yet more proof that there was no racial seachange amongst Jews as is claimed by the supporters of the Khazar theory. The historicallogical evidence therefore clearly shows that there has been no change in Jewish Supremacist behavior from the time of the ancient Romans to the presentday. If there had been largescale conversions, as the Khazar theory claims, the genetic continuity of the Jewish people would have been disrupted, which would likely have caused a change in behavior. As this behavior as remained constant, the historical account indicates that the Khazar theory is untrue. Part III The Reasons Why the Khazar Theory Has Come About 1. The Khazar Theory Deflects Attention from the Most Racist Jews of all, the Sephardic Jewish Extremists, suggests that there is not Jewish problem but a Khazar or Ashkenazi problem. The Khazar theory falls down when it is understood that it only attempts to explain the origin of the European or Ashkenazim Jewsand completely ignores the Sephardic and Mizrahi element of Jewry, which compromises nearly 40 of all Jews today and a majority of Jews in the Zionist State of Israel. The ludicrousness of the situation is underlined when it is appreciated that the Sephardic element of Jewry tends to be the most religious and the most orthodox. They most closely follow the dictates of the Talmud and the Torah lawsand are therefore most immersed in the racist supremacy and antiGentile hatred which guides all Jewish behavior. It was, after all, the former chief rabbi of the Sephardic Jews in Israel who announced that Gentiles are donkeys, created by God only to serve Jews, among many other overtly racist comments. This ultra racist Jew, Rabbi Yosef, recently died and had the largest funeral in the history of Israel. By focusing on the bogus Khazar theory, its proponents deflect attention away from the proven historical record that Jewish Supremacist behavior is common to both Ashkenazim and Sephardic Jewish extremists. This is proven by the fact that Israel uses DNA tests to check if potential immigrants to that country are Jewish or not. If there was a wide divergence between Ashkenazim and Sephardic Jewry, as the Khazar theory would maintain, then it would not be possible for Israel to genetically distinguish who is a Jew and who is not. 2. The Khazar Theory is Popular Among AntiZionists For the Wrong Reasons In the wake of the Second World War and establishment of the Zionist State of Israel, the Khazar theory gained traction in the antiZionist movement. It seemed to be powerful argument against Zionism. If the leaders of the Zionist movement had no relation to the historical people called Jews in the Mideast, then the theoretical rationale of the Zionists to claim Palestine as a historical homeland, was demolished. This logic is, of course, fundamentally flawed, because it matters not if modern Jews were related or partly related to Jews who lived in the region 2,000 years earlier. No matter what the case, there is no moral justification for the Jewish terrorist creation of Israel. It is a crime against humanity to drive hundreds of thousands of men, women and children from their land and homes, terrorize them and murder thousands, just because of a claim that ones distant ancestors supposedly lived there millennia ago. It this logic is carried through to its conclusion, then it would be justified to drive from their homes 99.9 percent of the people alive on planet Earthbecause there is hardly a region on earth that has not been subjected to invasions or migrations throughout history. To explain this inconsistency another way by using the Khazar theory as proof that the Zionists cannot claim Israel because they are not the real Jews, the antiZionists are in fact saying that IF it can be shown that the Zionists ARE the real Jews, then they would have the right to claim Palestine as a homeland. Remember that a majority of Jews in Israel are Sephardic or Mizrahi Jews who are nonAshkenazi. This logic, as detailed above, is false. 3. The Khazar Theory is a Tactic to Disguise Jewish Supremacist Racism The Khazar argument is intrinsically related to the question of whether the presentday Jews are a religion or a race. Prominent Jews have long referred to Jews as a race, even in modern times. If there was any leader of world Jewry in the days before The Second World War it was Nahum Goldman, the President of the World Zionist organization. He said The Jews are divided into two categories, those who admit they belong to a race distinguished by a history thousands of years old, and those who dont. The latter are open to the charge of dishonesty. Even the current prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking before a gathering of Jews from all over the world, candidly referred to the Jewish race If Israel had not come into existence after World War II than sic I am certain the Jewish race wouldnt have survived. Daily Pilot, Newport Beach/Costa Mesa, Feb. 28, 2000, front page. Leading Jews have always defined themselves as much more than a religion but as people of special genealogy, and expressed the ultimate supremacism that God has chosen them above all others. Israel is a Jewish religious state, in which the religious dictates hold supreme. The rabbis determine all the important issues immigration, education, housing, and marriage. It matters not if a person believes in God or notthe only thing that counts is if one is of Jewish lineage, or Jewish descent. It matters not if ones Jewish mother was an atheist or a Haredim, or if her great grandmother was religious or notwhat ultimately counts is ones blood, not ones belief in God. Ironically, this is not only true in Israel. It is true in the very synagogues of the Jewish religion across the globe. Atheist No problem as long as if you are of the tribe. The tactic of claiming that Judaism is simply a religion is an effective defensive strategy. Whenever anyone complains about Jewish domination of any institution achieved by favoring their own and disfavoring their nonJewish competitors, Jewish Supremacists simply say that they are a religion like any other, rather than an ethnic group. People in America, Europe, and the Western world, all overwhelmingly endorse the concept of religious freedomand thus they equate criticism of Jewish actions as religious bigotry and oppression. After all, the claim is made, it is just a religion. This is a Jewish Supremacist tactic They disguise Jewish racism through religious dogma, rather than admitting ethnic nationalism. I have come to believe that the Khazar theory is one more piece of controlled opposition as illustrated in Orwells 1984 where Emmanuel Goldstein is supposedly Big Brothers opposition, but in fact he is part of the Big Brother apparatus. How convenient it is to suggest that Jews are not a race, not a related people that gives them a unity and strength in conflict with other peoples. One cannot explain the power of Zionism unless one understands Jewish tribalism. Jewish tribalism racism and favoritism and preference for fellow Jews combined with discrimination against nonJews ultimately enables them to take over almost any institution. Without Jewish racism, Zionism could not flourish, for that is what gives the Jewish extremists its enormous economic, media and political influence. Christians who propagate the Khazar theory should not forget that the Talmud is perhaps the most antiChrist tome ever written. The Talmud portrays Jesus being boiled in human excrementforever The Talmud as well the gospel recounting of the Jewish persecution behind the crucifixion of Christ all took place hundreds of years before any supposed Khazar conversion How convenient it is for the antiZionist, antiJewish supremacist efforts be divided on the foundation of the Jewish problem. Bear in mind, the problem we face is not a Khazar problem, it is a Jewish problem, it is a problem of extremist Jewish racism and supremacism which continually plunges our world into war, hatred, tyranny and degradation. It is for these reasons, that I no longer believe the Khazar theory. Anyone who opposes Jewish extremism, supremacism and Zionism I consider an ally and brother in the cause for the liberation of Europeans and every people on the Planet from the ZioGlobalist threat. I accept whole heartedly those who still believe the Khazar theory, but at the same time I must express what I think to be the truth that, overall, the theory does more harm than good in our efforts to oppose Jewish tribalism. As a final note is important to show that Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews are not claimed to be Khazars by anyone and they were throughout the Mediterranean world at the time of Christ some 900 years before any alleged Khazar conversion. They were the ones who crucified Christ, the ones Christ railed against. Some of the very same people who expose the Talmud and the Jewish role in Christ crucifixion are now telling us that Jews are actually Khazars today Not a single Khazar wrote a word of the vicious Talmud. The most important Jewish rabbi in Israel is the Chief Sephardic Rabbi, as typified by the late Ovadia Yosef. Yosef was viciously antiGentile and anti European and antiPalestinian. When he died he was honored like no other Israeli citizen in history  with the largest funeral honored by all Ashkenazi, Sephardi and Mizrahi. Although I am friends with and respect all who believe in the Khazar theory if they are fighting against the Jewish Supremacists, I though will personally will no longer endorse what I believe is a patently false idea fostered upon us by Jewish communists who seek to lessen our understanding of the core threat of Jewish racism and Jewish tribalist supremacism. When people tell us the threat of Ashkenazi Jews it confuses people on the subject to no end. It deflects from the fundamental fact that the Jewish establishment, i.e. every major Jewish organization of all types of Jews is working for our genocide.",hate

"30 Views Share Precommentary by Dr. David Duke. An article in the Jewish Daily Forward newspaper has claimed that Jewish charities give more money to Israel than they do to education, and that this figure is of the order of 26 billion. As Professor Kevin McDonald points out in this article below, this figure is actually not even the real totalit is considerably more. As he points out, this figure does not include what is collected at synagoguesand then given to Israeleach month, because synagogues, schools and seminaries are not required to file tax returns. This is of real importance for everyone who wishes to understand how the Jewish lobby in America works, and how it uses American moneyand taxpayersto keep the racist Jewsonly state of Israel in business. The immense wealth of the Jewish lobby is not the product of Jewish ingenuityit is the product of active discrimination in favor of Jews by other Jewsin the educational system, the economy and in the media. Forward Study of the Jewish Charity Industry By Professor Kevin MacDonald. The 26 billion dollar figure in the title refers to the net assets of the network of explicitly Jewish charitable organizations, which puts it in the same league as a major corporation. Annual revenue is around 1214 billion. Assuming an American Jewish population of around 6.4 million, this implies assets per capita of over 4000 and per capita annual giving of around half that. Based on an older survey indicating 2.3 persons per Jewish household, annual giving per household would be around 4600. These numbers are certainly not earth shaking, but, when broken down to particular categories, they indicate that Jewish activist organizations are indeed well funded, especially when compared to the financial resources of organizations that oppose Jewish interests probably well under 1 million for organizations explicitly dedicated to advancing the interests of White Americans. For example, 6 of the 3.7 billion in annual donations for functional charities is allocated for General Advocacy 222,000,000 annually, and 38 goes to Israelrelated causes 1.4 billion annually. Advocacy presumably includes the ADL which reported revenue of over 53 million in 2012enough to fund over 31 million in employee salaries including Abe Foxman at 688,188  and 28 regional offices. Thats a lot of power in opposition to European interests given the virtual nonexistence of organizations explicitly dedicated to furthering European identification and interests. These numbers for donations to Jewish charity are underestimates because the IRS doesnt require synagogues to file tax returns, and the same goes for schools and seminaries. As a result, the 12 billion to 14 billion in annual revenue, the Forwards best estimate based on tax filings, is probably billions of dollars short of the networks actual size. The other way in which such a report fails to get at the scope of financial support for Jewish ethnic activism is that it does not include organizations that are not explicitly Jewish but are supported by Jews for ethnic reasons. As Norman Podhoretz notes, Jews are the financial engine of the left, but of course the vast majority of charity for leftist causes would not appear in the Forward article because they are not explicitly Jewish organizations. A good example is the SPLC which is largely Jewishfunded but would not be considered a Jewish communal organization. In 2012 the SPLC reported revenue of over 37 million and salaries of over 16 million. Or consider the neocon infrastructure, such as the Foundation for Defense of Democracies All of the identifiable donors are Jews, including a host of wellknown Jewish activists like Edgar M. Bronfman 1,050,000 and Michael Steinhardt 850,000 who cofounded the Birthright Israel program that brings Jewish young people to Israel for a dose of Jewish patriotism. The same goes for the Republicans and Democrats, where Jewish funding promotes Israel and the liberal/left values of the Jewish community likely at least 60 of Democrat funding, and at least 40 of Republican. For example, Haim Saban has donated millions to the Democrats, and right now Republicans who are considering a run for president are courting Sheldon Adelson who donated more than 100 million to Republicans in the last presidential election cycle as a preliminary to everything else they must do to prove their worthiness, like kissing babies in Iowa or formulating a position on jobs. And anyone with a half a brain knows that Adelsons support begins and ends with what the candidate will do for Israel. Ditto for David Gelfands donation of more than 100 million to the Sierra Club on condition that it adopt a view on immigration in sync with the views of the organized Jewish community. My gloss, but its hard to believe that his donation did not reflect the typical Jewish commitment to displacementlevel immigration. In other words, a lot of the most destructive Jewish funding is not included in these figures. And even though the donations to the explicitly Jewish organizations covered by the article are only the tip of the iceberg, there is no suggestion that the Jewish community is highly mobilized at this time, as indicated by the per capita data. A crisis in Israel would lead to a huge upsurge of Jewish funding, as it did during the 1967 and 1973 wars  as would any indication that European Americans are beginning to develop a sense of racial identity and beginning to assert their interests by developing explicitly European organizations which have the wherewithal to make a difference.",hate

"114 Views Share In 2006, a remarkable articleand admissionappeared in the Israeli news source Ynet News. Titled  Stalins Jews  and written by Jewish columnist Sever Plocker, this piece confirmed that terrible crimes which Jewish Communists had committed under Stalin. We must not forget that some of greatest murderers of modern times were Jewish, Plocker started out by saying. He went on to make a number of startling confessions Heres a particularly forlorn historical date Almost 90 years ago, between the 19th and 20th of December 1917, in the midst of the Bolshevik revolution and civil war, Lenin signed a decree calling for the establishment of The AllRussian Extraordinary Commission for Combating CounterRevolution and Sabotage, also known as Cheka. Within a short period of time, Cheka became the largest and cruelest state security organization. Its organizational structure was changed every few years, as were its names From Cheka to GPU, later to NKVD, and later to KGB. We cannot know with certainty the number of deaths Cheka was responsible for in its various manifestations, but the number is surely at least 20 million, including victims of the forced collectivization, the hunger, large purges, expulsions, banishments, executions, and mass death at Gulags. Whole population strata were eliminated Independent farmers, ethnic minorities, members of the bourgeoisie, senior officers, intellectuals, artists, labor movement activists, opposition members who were defined completely randomly, and countless members of the Communist party itself. In his new, highly praised book The War of the World, Historian Niall Ferguson writes that no revolution in the history of mankind devoured its children with the same unrestrained appetite as did the Soviet revolution. In his book on the Stalinist purges, Tel Aviv Universitys Dr. Igal Halfin writes that Stalinist violence was unique in that it was directed internally. Lenin, Stalin, and their successors could not have carried out their deeds without widescale cooperation of disciplined terror officials, cruel interrogators, snitches, executioners, guards, judges, perverts, and many bleeding hearts who were members of the progressive Western Left and were deceived by the Soviet regime of horror and even provided it with a kosher certificate. And us, the Jews An Israeli student finishes high school without ever hearing the name Genrikh Yagoda, the greatest Jewish murderer of the 20th Century, the GPUs deputy commander and the founder and commander of the NKVD. Yagoda diligently implemented Stalins collectivization orders and is responsible for the deaths of at least 10 million people. His Jewish deputies established and managed the Gulag system. After Stalin no longer viewed him favorably, Yagoda was demoted and executed, and was replaced as chief hangman in 1936 by Yezhov, the bloodthirsty dwarf. The Jew Genrikh Yagoda, director of the NKVD, the Soviet Unions Stalinera security and intelligence agency. Yezhov was not Jewish but was blessed with an active Jewish wife. In his book Stalin Court of the Red Star, Jewish historian Sebag Montefiore writes that during the darkest period of terror, when the Communist killing machine worked in full force, Stalin was surrounded by beautiful, young Jewish women. Stalins close associates and loyalists included member of the Central Committee and Politburo Lazar Kaganovich. Montefiore characterizes him as the first Stalinist and adds that those starving to death in Ukraine, an unparalleled tragedy in the history of human kind, did not move Kaganovich. Many Jews sold their soul to the devil of the Communist revolution and have blood on their hands for eternity. Well mention just one more Leonid Reichman, head of the NKVDs special department and the organizations chief interrogator, who was a particularly cruel sadist. Yagoda center inspecting the construction of the MoscowVolga canal, built by slave labor from the Gulags. In 1934, according to published statistics, 38.5 percent of those holding the most senior posts in the Soviet security apparatuses were of Jewish origin. Even if we deny it, we cannot escape the Jewishness of our hangmen, who served the Red Terror with loyalty and dedication from its esta blishment. After all, others will always remind us of their origin. The Gulags JewishRun Concentration Camps As mentioned above, the infamous Soviet Gulags were under the direct control of the Jew Yagoda. He was not the only such Jew involved in the running of these camps, in which millions were interned and nearly 1.4 million died. The most famous revelation about the Jewish nature of the Gulags was that of famous dissident Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Speaking from personal experience as a Gulag prisoner, Solzhenitsyn gave a candid account of Jews in charge of the Soviet prison camps in his book, Two Hundred Years Together. According to his observations, Jews made up a clear preponderance in the Gulag administration and in the early Bolshevist government, saying that of the 22 ministers in the first Soviet government three were Russian, one Georgian, one Armenian and 17 were Jews. In addition, he points out, from personal experience once again, that two thirds of the Kiev Cheka secret police were Jews. In 1937, another book appeared in Germany called JewishRun Concentration Camps in the Soviet Union, which revealed that Communist Jews were the commandants of 11 out of the 12 main Gulags.",hate

"Share Tulsi Gabbard for Secretary of State An example of the need for political realignment By Dr. Patrick Slattery  On Monday Donald Trump met with Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. She has been mentioned as a possible Secretary of State, or even Secretary of Defense she is an Iraq War combat veteran and Major in the Hawaii National Guard. Its not just that she would be preferable in these jobs to John Bolton, Rudi Giuliani, or Mitt Romney, but is probably the very best candidate from the ranks of the Washington establishment. In particular, she is unique in being a strong and principled opponent of any intervention in Syria. She wants the United States to stop supporting ISIS and other rebel groups and let the Russians, Iranians, and Hezbollah help President Assad defeat the jihadists and end the Syrian Civil War which is more an armed invasion than a real civil war. This is exactly the right approach. And its not just that she is on the right side of this issue. It is her signature issue. She is on the Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committees, so this is what she has spent her time on. Its not that shes perfect. It has been noted that she at the very least pays lipservice to Israel. Everyone on Capital Hill does. Lets face it, Zionism is the established religion in America, and there IS a religious test for office. But her fault goes further than that. She condemned the government of thenUkrainian President Victor Yanukovich in February 2014, just as Hillary Clintons erstwhile Secretary of State Victoria Nuland was organizing his overthrow. Gabbard, like everyone else in Congress, then supported arming the Jewishdominated government that Nuland put in place in Kiev. Even so, her Congressional website does not carry any mention of Ukraine since 2014, and her vocal opposition to starting World War III with Russia over Syria seems to indicate that her view towards Russia have become more realistic. This, as has been noted elsewhere, is in line with Trumps view. But there is one more significant benefit of appointing Gabbard as Secretary of State. It could help trigger a badly needed realignment of American politics. As people like Ralph Nader have long been telling us, there is no significant difference between Democrats and Republicans. That is because the most divisive issues in politics are not the existential issues that face our society and the world. If there has been one litmus test in politics during my lifetime it has been abortion. It may engender strong emotions, but it hardly ranks with nuclear war as a threat to humanity. Yet I cannot tell you how many staunchly antiwar people in 2004 voted for prowar Democrat John Kerry because they were worried about Bush appointing prolife judges to the Supreme Court. Talk about getting your priorities backwards This year, despite senior statesmen like Mikhail Gorbachev warning us that the threat of a nuclear World War III has never been higher, foreign policy was all but absent from the campaign. Only nonmainstream elements like the paleoconservatives, the AltRight, Greens, and stray individuals from the old left like Stephen F. Cohen managed to finally get it injected into the campaign just in the nick of time. In such a close election, one could certainly make the case that this made the difference. At this point in time, war has to be the top priority. As important as immigration may be, what difference will it make in a postapocalyptic Mad Max world Of course, if we could organize around opposing Jewish power, it would take care of war, but far too few people are awake enough to make this possible. In fact, Israel currently has no role as an organizing feature in Americas political alignment as both parties so unanimously support it blindly. But as the realignment proceeds along an America First noninterventionist foreign policy, an America First immigration policy is a natural outcome. If Trump embraces Gabbard and rejects the neocons and their goy toys like Mitt Romney, it would really help clarify the sides in this struggle. Party labels mean nothing. Romney and Ryan and the like already revealed themselves by opposing Trump. There are tons of people outside of the Republican Party who could conceivably rally around Trumps foreign and other policies, and it is imperative that The Donald make a point of bringing in some of these people into high profile positions while visibly snubbing his true enemies from within the Republican Party.",hate

And what did they think of Hillary Did they believe their defenses of her wrongdoing Podesta and Tanden ridiculed her associates for the coverup. Why didnt they get this stuff out like 18 months ago So crazy, she wondered. Unbelievable, Podesta wrote. They wanted to get away with it. Since the early days of the email scandal, weve been treated to the sordid rituals of feigned innocence. The issue was a nonissue, Clinton surrogates were quick to assure us. And even if it was, no one did anything wrong. The flies on the wall knew better though and now we can all be the flies on the wall. Away from the cameras and the briefings, the Clintonites held their bosses in contempt. Neera Tanden, a supposed close associate of Hillary, blasted her instincts as suboptimal and described her as suffering from a character problem. And there was never any doubt as to what was going on. Tanden ridiculed Cheryl Mills for the mess. Mills fired off an email to Podesta warning that Obamas denial wouldnt hold up. We need to clean this up  he has emails from her  they do not say state.gov, she warned. Obama had offered his usual denial claiming to have only learned about the scandal from the media. The revelation that Hillary had emailed Obama from her illegal address would show that he had lied. But meanwhile his people struggled to reinvent his lie by claiming that while he knew about her illegal address, he didnt know that it was illegal. This put his lie in line with Hillarys lie. There was only one problem. When in doubt, the Clintons take refuge in the final lie that you may be able to prove that they did wrong, but not that they meant to do wrong. That was Hillarys final email defense to the FBI. Spliced with claims of memory loss due to a concussion was that old Sergeant Schultz favorite, I know nothing. But that defense completely falls apart once you prove that they did know. That is what the leaked emails have begun doing. They are establishing that the Sergeant Schultz defense is utterly hollow. Cheryl Mills knew. John Podesta knew. Barack Obama knew. And Hillary Clinton knew. When Obama told a lie that could easily be disproven while trying to distance himself from Hillary, Mills quickly fired off a warning that he had better get his story straight. And his people did. That makes Obama complicit before and after the fact. He knew what Hillary was doing when she was doing it. And his people participated in the effort to cover it up afterward, not just to protect her, but to protect him. Hillary Clinton was not a rogue actor. She was part of an administration that had waged a war on transparency. Even media allies had dubbed it as the least transparent administration in history. Lies, censorship and targeting whistleblowers were the norm for Obama Inc. A New York Times reporter dubbed it, The greatest enemy of press freedom in a generation. The Washington Post noted that the, Obama administration routinely makes a mockery of its longago pledge to establish itself as the most transparent administration in U.S. history. The AP pointed out that it, more often than ever censored government files or outright denied access to them. Bizarre administration email dodges included EPA boss Lisa Jackson using Richard Windsor as her alias. Jackson/Windsor left the EPA and took a seat on the board of the Clinton Foundation. Tanden and Podesta didnt take issue with Hillary Clinton breaking the law, but with her clumsy political instincts, her inability to fake sincere apologies and spin scandals as smoothly as Obama. Hillarys biggest flaw in their eyes was her clumsiness at covering up acts that were routine in in Obamaworld. They didnt despise her because she broke the law, but because she was bad at it. That made her a threat to their political futures. Hillarys clumsy instincts led her to the point of having to admit what she did while denying having intended to do it. Motive is simultaneously the strongest and weakest defense. You can prove what someone else did, but it is hard to prove what someone else meant to do. Unless you have their emails. This is Hillarys firewall. Its what every painful trickle of the scandal was meant to drag out and delay. Every partial revelation is buying time while bringing us closer to the final breach in the motive wall. What the Podesta emails tell us is that they knew. Those around Hillary knew. And those around them knew that the inner circle knew. They knew and they hated Hillary for being a bad liar. And now, as the inside drama of Clintonworld spills across the internet, the red queen moves closer to being in check. By making it all about motive, Hillary Clinton turned personal communications, particularly emails, into the key instrument of culpability. That is why Podestas emails are such a hot commodity. Its why her emails are becoming an even bigger prize. Neera Tanden was right. Hillary Clintons political instincts are suboptimal. She is the member of the Obama graduating class voted least likely to be able to lie convincingly on national television. And she has a perverse knack for dragging everyone around her into her scandals while exposing their own. We know that her people knew that she lied. We know that Obama lied. All thats left is her final lie.",hate
"Search Election Law Violation Was Hillarys Idea Orders to use Donald Duck to foment violence at Trump rallies came straight from the top. October 27, 2016 Matthew Vadum Democrat Hillary Clinton personally authorized illegal dirty tricks operations against Republican Donald Trumps campaign, according to top Democrats appearing in undercover video. In the third Hillaryrelated video released by ACORN slayer James OKeefe and his Project Veritas Action Fund this past Sunday Oct. 23, Clinton is directly implicated in a scheme to use Donald Duck to mock Trump and troll his supporters at Trump campaign rallies. Among Disney cartoon characters Donald Duck was a natural choice. After all, his name used to appear regularly on voter registration documents when Bill and Hillary Clintons favorite community organizing group, the nowdefunct ACORN, hired hobos and felons to go on voterregistration drives. Earlier this year Democrats in Donald Duck costumes started appearing at Trump events across America. Costumed individuals would walk around carrying signs. One said, Trump ducks releasing his tax return. This cutesy publicity stunt isnt necessarily the problem, though. The problem is that Hillary Clinton ordered it and apparently broke the law by coordinating with a taxexempt nonprofit group. Prominent in the video is political organizer Robert Creamer who is very high up in the Democratic Partys hierarchy. He has reportedly visited the Obama White House 342 times, including 47 meetings with Obama personally. One of the visits took place in Obamas personal living quarters. Its a very big deal that Creamer visited the presidents residence in the White House, a former senior White House employee told FrontPage in an interview. White House employees can work there for years and never visit the residence. Creamer, a practitioner of the agitation arts taught by Marxist community organizing guru Saul Alinsky, is husband tof Rep. Jan Schakowsky DIll., a socialist and advocate of singlepayer health care. Creamer is considered by many to be the legislative architect of Obamacare. He also wrote a series of bad checks to cover his salary at a nonprofit and went to prison. Prosecutors wanted to send him up the river for 37 months but he got off with merely five months and 11 months of home confinement from a friendly Democrat judge. Creamer is a founder of the unsavory political consulting firm Democracy Partners . The list of partners on the companys website is a whos who of elite Democratic Party power players. In addition to Creamer, the partners are Midwest Academy founder Heather Booth  website developer Marc Cerabona  organizer Wyatt Closs  SEIU veteran Mac DAlessandro  Maccabee Group founder Brett C. Di Resta  CrossCurrents Foundation cofounder Ken Grossinger  former Media Matters for America online organizer David Grossman  former SEIU national field director for politics John Hennelly  strategic communications advisor Marilyn Katz  organizer Jackie Kendall  strategist Lupe Lopez  political consultant Mike Lux  strategic advisor Josie Mooney  consultant Patrick Pannett  organizer Christine Pelosi her mother is House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi USAction president Khalid Pitts  former DNC general counsel Joe Sandler  consultant Linda Saucedo  fundraiser Renee Schaeffer  former New Organizing Institute senior fellow Joel Silberman  and organizer Cheri Whiteman . Listed as associates are Lauren Windsor , executive director of American Family Voices, and Aaron Black , who appears in the undercover videos. Black describes himself in the footage as basically deputy rapid response director for the DNC on the ground at Trump events, adding nobodys supposed to know about me. FrontPage published an article yesterday examining Democracy Partners. For a master practitioner of fascistic tactics, Creamer is amazingly lacking in selfawareness or just plain dishonest. He wrote a fatuous, ahistorical oped in the Huffington Post earlier this year titled Can Fascism Triumph in America Like other fascist movements, Trump says out loud  and legitimates  the kind of hateful, violent language that was previously whispered only in the privacy of peoples living rooms. Bear in mind that quite apart from his mischaracterization of Trumps public statements, Creamer is shown in the videos masterminding an elaborate criminal conspiracy involving the use of targeted political violence against political opponents. Fomenting and carrying out acts of violence against political opponents was what the fascist Third Reich did, using the Sturmabteiling or S.A., also called brown shirts and storm troopers. Ditto for Mussolinis Squadristi black shirts, Maos Red Guards, Irans Basij , and Haitis Tonton Macoute . Creamer explains the Donald Duck action in the third video. In the end, it was the candidate, Hillary Clinton, the future president of the United States, who wanted ducks on the ground, Creamer says in one of several exchanges. So, by God, we would get ducks on the ground. Creamer makes it clear he knows that this coordination between his consulting firm, Democracy Partners, and the campaign was a huge legal landmine when he said Dont repeat that to anybody. The whole duck thing That came about, the reason we moved it from DNC to Americans United for Change was to just do a hopscotch, but the actual idea was hatched way back in May, Creamer associate Scott Foval said, making a pun. The duck has to be an Americans United for Change entity, Creamer said. This had to do only with some problem between now acting DNC chief Donna Brazile and ABC, which is owned by Disney, because they were worried about a trademark issue. Thats why. Its really silly. We originally launched this duck because Hillary Clinton wants the duck. In any case, so she really wanted this duck figure out there doing stuff, so that was fine. So, we put all these ducks out there and got a lot of coverage. And Trump taxes. And then ABC/Disney went crazy because they thought our original slogan was Donald ducks his taxes, releasing his tax returns. Creamer is shown in the video hoping Disney would file a lawsuit against Democrats for using Donald Duck in the campaign, likely because such a thing would generate publicity. Let them sue us. Please God, he says, looking to the heavens and clasping his hands together as if in prayer. I doubt they will because were paying to rent or buy the suits, thats where they get their license fees. Were not using it for commercial purposes. The Wall Street Journal reported Aug. 18 that Donald ducks was the creation of the Democratic National Committee. Then on Sept. 8 the paper reported the DNC is no longer associated with the duck  Americans United for Change is now managing the duck  But out of public view the DNC and the Clinton campaign were still controlling the duck operation, breaking federal campaign coordination laws, OKeefe says in narrating the third video. We kind of divvy up responsibilities. So sometimes it will be, like, campaign owned, said Jenna Price, assistant press secretary at the DNC. So sometimes you will see that they advised something, or they are taking credit for things. So, like, we arent taking credit for the duck anymore. Thats like, random ally groups. But its still something that were involved in. Brad Woodhouse, president of Americans United for Change, expected the presence of the duck at events would spark violence. I think this duck is going to get roughed up somewhere. In one segment, Foval says, I almost got punched on Monday morning, I mean, I was in a duck costume. The nations campaign coordination laws were enacted after President Richard Nixons Watergate scandal, OKeefe notes. For an activity to violate the law it must meet a threepart test, he explains. First, there must be payment by someone other than the candidate for electionrelated activity. Second, a campaign has to be materially involved in shaping communications for a third party group. And third, electoral advocacy has to take place close to an election. OKeefe continues The payment prong of the test is complicated but just the fact that Foval, a paid employee of Americans United for Change, was the duck at some events constitutes payment by AUfC. Conduct, based on their own admission the campaign, Creamer, their agent, and AUfC coordinated the duck activities. And finally content. Donald ducks is undeniably political content directed against one candidate for the sole purpose of helping another. The fourth video, released yesterday, isnt so much an expose of wrongdoing but it does provide ample evidence of Creamers ties to the Clinton campaign and to President Obama himself. In a phone call Creamer says I spend most of my time overseeing the Trump events around the country. I mean, thats what I do for the Clinton campaign, uh, so thats interesting as well. In another scene when an undercover reporter phones saying he needs an immigration lawyer with powerful connections for a wealthy client in Syria, Creamer makes it clear he is happy to help by reaching out to Obamas inner circle. I just need to, I will try and find a couple of good referrals to you and get back to you pretty quick then. Okay  On the first, well, Ill just talk, the guy Im going to talk to first, to see if this is up his alley, the first thing is up his alley. Its the guy who ran the campaign for President Obama. He has a firm thats pretty well connected. In another setting, Creamer says Heres what I do for the Clinton campaign by the way. Im a consultant to the Clinton campaign. Wherever Trump or Pence go in the country, we make sure that there are press events in the TV market or whatever  whether theyre big turnouts or little turnouts, whatever, that drive our message wherever the candidate goes to drive his message. So that on any given day they will be between them probably in six places. So our team makes sure there are events in all those six places every day. So it is a lot of events, and we try and help define the other candidate. Every morning I am on a call at 1030 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters, added Creamer. He continued Im in this campaign mainly to deal with what, you know, earned media, with the television, radio. With earned media and social media, not with paid media, not with advertising. There would be a whole different advertising  everybody is driven on the same tracks, though. So then there are a couple, a bunch of people in the Brooklyn office of the Clinton campaign that are responsible for possible aspects of communication. Like, we do rapid response and there is a guy there I work with heavily, is the guy that I was just communicating with on that kind of stuff. For instance, we just found, I just sent him a note beforehand when we came here that said, My understanding is there might be another revelation of another woman talking about Trump this afternoon. Creamer bragged again about his ties to President Obama. Oh Barack Obamas was the best campaign in the history of American politics, I mean the second one, I mean the first was good too. I was a consultant to both, the second one, was everything hit on every level and every aspect. Obama is a pro, Creamer said. Ive known the president since he was a community organizer in Chicago. I was just at an event with him in Chicago actually, on Friday last. He is just as good as ever. I do a lot of work with the White House on their issues, helping to run issue campaigns that they have been involved in. I mean, for immigration reform for the, the health care bill, trying to make America more like Britain when it comes to gun violence issues. The second video , released Oct. 18, was a primer on how Democrats get away with massive voter fraud. Its a very easy thing for Republicans to say, well theyre bussing people in, said Scott Foval, then national field director for Americans United for Change. Well you know what Weve been bussing people in to deal with you fuckin assholes for 50 years and were not going to stop now  were just going to find a different way to do it. So, I mean I grew up with that idea. They used to bus people out to Iowa. If we needed people out there wed bus people out to Iowa. In a discussion OKeefe described as focusing on bringing people from one state to another state to vote illegally, Foval, who also worked as deputy political director at George Sorosfunded People for the American Way PfAW, explains how to get away with voter fraud. Instead of bussing people in, it is better to have them travel in their own personal vehicles, he said. Would they charge each individual of voter fraud Or are they going to go after the facilitator for conspiracy, which they could prove Its one thing if all these people drive up in their personal cars. If theres a bus involved That changes the dynamic. Its the legality, because you can prove conspiracy if theres a bus, he said. If there are cars its much harder to prove  if theres enough money you have people drive their POVs personally owned vehicles or you can have them drive rentals. Foval says its easy to keep the voter fraud operation a secret. So you use shells. Use shell companies. Democrats are untouchable, he said. The question is, whether when you get caught by a reporter, does that matter Because does it turn into an investigation or not In this case, this state, the answer is no, because they dont have any power to do anything. Foval explained in the first video how proClinton super PACs communicate with each other and how their information finds its way to the DNC, presumably a violation of federal law. I guarandamntee you that the people who run the super PACs all talk to each other and we and a few other people are the hubs of that communication. Were consultants, Foval says, so were not the official entity and so those conversations can be had between consultants who are working for different parts. He adds The thing that we have to watch is making sure there is a double blind between the actual campaign and the actual DNC and what were doing. Theres a double blind there. So they can plausibly deny that they knew anything about it. The Clinton campaign is fully in it, veteran leftwing strategist Robert Creamer confirms on hidden camera. Hillary knows through the chain of command whats going on. OKeefes group, Project Veritas Action Fund, filed a formal complaint against the Clinton campaign with the Federal Election Commission last week. The complaint states that Project Veritas uncovered a criminal conspiracy where, in the words of Scott Foval, The way it works is The Hillary for America campaign pays DNC, DNC pays Democracy Partners, Democracy Partners pays The Foval Group, The Foval Group goes and executes  on the ground. This has been done in a manner to evade federal election law and violating coordinated expenditures rules. The complaint also accuses Priorities USA Action, Alliance for Retired Americans, Americans United for Change, and the Democratic National Committee of accepting prohibited and excessive contributions in the form of coordinated expenditures contrary to federal law and regulations. The first undercover video OKeefe released sent shock waves through the political community. In that video , released Oct. 17, we learned that the frequent outbursts of violence at Republican candidate Trumps campaign rallies have been orchestrated and paid for by Clintons campaign. The idea was to foment violent at Trump rallies in order to create the false impression that his campaign and supporters were violent crazy people and at the same time provide evidence to support the Lefts predetermined narrative that the billionaire businessman is a dangerous fascist. Such behavior constitutes terrorism, Austin Bay writes at the Observer  Creamer ran what amounts to a domestic U.S. political terror and propaganda operation dedicated to undermining the 2016 U.S. presidential electionrigging the election, to use the current term.  The election rigging scheme he commanded relies on street thuggery. That means physical fearterroris a core component of Americans United for Changes crooked enterprise. Street thuggery is very lowlevel terrorism, but it is a type of terrorism nonetheless and it is wrong to call it otherwise. Hardboy muscle, bottles and two by fours are street thuggerys kinetics. Bottles and baseball bats are not Al Qaedas high explosivesbut they incite fear and when they crack heads they cause casualties. People bleed. Street thuggery as an arm of politics is violent, criminalized politics on an ugly downward slope to much worse, the worse including lynchings and pogroms. If you dont think street thuggery is terror then consider Kristalnacht. And OKeefe isnt finished with the Hillary Clinton campaign yet. Our lawyers wont let us release all our @HillaryClinton  DNC footage,OKeefe tweeted Tuesday. For those demanding full raw footage, be VERY careful what you wish for.",hate
"Realism About the Jihad Threat in Oklahoma Oklahoma State Rep. John Bennett ventures where few dare to tread. October 27, 2016 Robert Spencer In an age of nearuniversal denial and willful ignorance at the highest levels about the ideological roots, nature and magnitude of the jihad threat, it is as unusual as it is refreshing to find lawmakers at any level who are willing to approach the problem honestly. State Representative John Bennett of Oklahoma, a Marine and combat veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan , is one of an alltoorare breed. On Tuesday, Bennett held an Interim Study on the current threat posed by radical Islam and the effect that Shariah Law, the Muslim Brotherhood and jihadist indoctrination have in the radicalization process in Oklahoma and America. In his request to hold this study, he explained This will be a study of the current threat posed by radical Islam and the effect that Shariah Law, the Muslim Brotherhood and jihadist indoctrination have in the radicalization process in Oklahoma and America. This kind of study should have been held not just in the Oklahoma House of Representatives, but in the U.S. House, and Senate as well. That such an idea is inconceivable is an indication of the fix were in. And the situation is only marginally better in Oklahoma nowadays the misinformation and disinformation about what were up against is so universal that anywhere the truth is told about this threat, there is significant pushback from the allies and enablers of jihad and Islamic supremacism. And so it was in Tulsa on Tuesday. The interim study featured testimony by former FBI agent John Guandolo and Chris Gaubatz, whose exploits as an undercover agent infiltrating the Hamaslinked Council on AmericanIslamic Relations CAIR are chronicled in the eyeopening book Muslim Mafia . Gaubatz and Guandolo presented evidence, including land records, showing that the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City ISGOC is owned by the Muslim Brotherhood group the North American Islamic Trust NAIT, that both CAIR, which has an active chapter in Oklahoma City, and ISGOC are Muslim Brotherhood organizations, and that CAIR has extensive ties to the jihad terror group Hamas, which styles itself the Muslim Brotherhood for Palestine. They pointed out that since Imad Enchassi, the imam of ISGOC, is a Palestinian and has all these ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, he likely also has links to Hamas. Guandolo and Gaubatz did not base their case on innuendo and hearsay. They laid out FBI evidence, Muslim Brotherhood documents, and more, demonstrating that the claims they were making were based on solid evidence. Predictably, however, the mainstream media, which we now know beyond any shadow of a doubt is simply and solely a propaganda arm for the Left and the Democratic Party , focused entirely on the presence of Adam Soltani of CAIROK and Enchassi. The Tulsa World ran a piece with the hysterical headline State representative brands CAIROK, its director and a local imam as terrorists. It quoted Soltani raging against Bennett Rep. Bennett is shamefully wasting taxpayer money to promote his own biased agenda. This hearing was a new low for Rep. Bennett, as his guests presented a biased narrative that achieves nothing more than demonizing and marginalizing the Oklahoma Muslim community. The World magisterially told its readers that CAIR is a Muslim civil liberties and advocacy group working to enhance the understanding of Islam. It didnt see fit to mention that CAIR is an unindicted coconspirator in a Hamas terror funding case  so named by the Justice Department. There was not a word in the World report about how CAIR officials have repeatedly refused to denounce Hamas and Hizballah as terrorist groups. Several former CAIR officials have been convicted of various crimes related to jihad terror . CAIRs cofounder and longtime Board chairman Omar Ahmad, as well as its chief spokesman Ibrahim Hooper, have made Islamic supremacist statements . Ahmad denies this, but the original reporter stands by her story . A California chapter distributed a poster telling Muslims not to talk to the FBI, and a Florida chapter distributed pamphlets with the same message . CAIR has opposed virtually every antiterror measure that has been proposed or implemented and has been declared a terror organization by the United Arab Emirates. But the Tulsa World and other mainstream media outlets that covered Bennetts study did not see fit to inform their readers of any of that instead, predictably enough, they portrayed the hearing as a baseless exercise in racebaiting and fearmongering conducted by a politician up for reelection. John Bennett, and the people of Oklahoma, deserve better. There are legitimate questions about CAIR and ISGOC Bennett dared to raise them Tuesday for that, he is being subjected to a media lynching that is cynically designed to obscure the genuine concerns he raised  yet ever since a member of ISGOC beheaded a coworker in 2014, these concerns are more urgent than ever. The media enablers of jihad must be decisively repudiated. Please email the Speaker of the Oklahoma House, Jeff W. Hickman, politely and courteously expressing your support for John Bennett and requesting that his hearing be just the first of a series. His email is email protected and his phone number is 405 5577339. John Bennett has yet again stuck his neck out for freedom. In these hard times, those who are willing to do that have to hang together.",hate
"Our New Country Women And Minorities Hit Hardest The rape culture the media wont cover. October 27, 2016 Ann Coulter Every ethnic group except whites blocvotes for the Democrats. Coincidentally, the Democrats have brought in another 30 to 40 million nonwhite immigrants in the last few decades. It doesnt help that white voters cant agree on what constitutes an acceptable candidate. In 2012, workingclass whites sat out the election, rather than vote for the outoftouch rich guy they saw in Mitt Romney. This year, the outoftouch rich guys say theyll vote for Hillary because Trump is tacky and gross. The sad irony is that the only people who will be better off in our new country are mostly white plutocrats  the top .01 percent. The rest of us will be their servants. The people who will be worse off are everybody else  the working class, the middle class who will soon be working class and, most of all, women, minorities, children, the elderly, the weakest and most vulnerable members of society. Look to Mexico for your future  or any Third World country. Or to Univisions Jorge Ramos. The ruling class in Mexico is composed of Europeanlooking, white descendants of Spanish conquistadors who raped the native population, giving them only their Spanish names in return. British settlers in America brought women with them. Explaining Latino cultures acceptance of incest and child rape, criminal justice researcher Shana Maier writes in a book about rape that the male is the head of the household, and women are subordinate to men. ... Hispanics and Latinos are more likely than other racial/ethnic groups to blame the victim. The victim, not the perpetrator, is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family. One American detective said that, today, police are being taught to keep an open mind about child rape because its a cultural thing. When it comes to multiculturalism, you cant say, We love the empanadas  but we dont want 40yearold men raping their nieces. This isnt an a la carte menu. We get ALL the attributes of the cultures were importing. As described in excruciating detail in Adios, America The Lefts Plan to Turn Our Country into a Third World Hellhole , our media already have a totally open mind about incest and child rape  and murder  when its committed by immigrants. Thus, for example, where I would have chosen the headline Illegal Alien Convicted of Incest, Child Rape, The Chattanooga Tenn. Times Free Press went with the less catchy Man guilty in case of human smuggling. And where I would have used the headline, Illegal Alien Repeatedly Raped 14yearold Girl at Job Site, The Commercial Dispatch in Columbus, Mississippi, went with the more subtle, Columbus resident charged with molestation. Immigrant women arrive in America, thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape, incest and spousal murder are acceptable, only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country, too  provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled. In 1989, Brooklyn judge Edward Pincus sentenced a Chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife, on the grounds that the murder flowed from traditional Chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood. The female head of the AsianAmerican Legal Defense and Education Fund, Margaret Fung, applauded the ruling. Somewhat amazingly, newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime. Anything to keep the Third World immigration flowing In 2013, a 13yearold girl was gangraped by about a dozen illegal aliens, who cheered and videoed the attack. When the news first broke, Shaneequa Jupiter, who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred, complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger. That could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants Even if Shaneequa had scoured the headlines, she would have been on the lookout for Austin men. Or Two. Compare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack  Two held in attack on child  Austin AmericanStatesman Texas, July 19, 2013  Two Mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over fiveday gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack  Daily Mail Online UK, July 24, 2013 Needless to say, The New York Times did not cover the Mexican illegal alien gang rape at all. By contrast, the Times, and every major American news outlet, extensively covered another gang rape  of a girl about the same age, at about the same time, in about the same place. The second case only was rape because of the girls young age  she was 11. But she was an enthusiastic participant, sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex. Those rapes, just a few years earlier, got a fullcourt press. The defendants were AfricanAmerican. The victim was Mexican. That time, there were articles in the Huffington Post, GQ, Slate, Salon and Mother Jones. It even made The New York Times, despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team. Similarly, within a few months of one another in 2013, two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in Decatur, Alabama, for assaults on 9yearold girls. One suspect was AfricanAmerican, the other was a Hispanic immigrant. Only one made the newspaper. Guess which one When excitable Muslims raped American reporter Lara Logan in Tahrir Square another one of Hillarys foreign policy successes, journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the Muslim rapists to white American men. Conclusion The real problem was the female reporters American bosses and colleagues. Definitely not Islam Sampling of New York Times commentary on Logans rape  Why We Need Women in War Zones I would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened. ... This attack also had nothing to do with Islam.  Reporting While Female Women reporters face another set of challenges. We are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not. ... In my experience, Muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment. Perhaps American men could do better, but, as American women may soon discover They never had it so good. Manifestly, the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help Americans  or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like America. They are designed to funnel welfaredependent voters to the Democrats and cheap labor to the rich. The Chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife, for example, came to America based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher. Our country will be Zimbabwe, but  if all goes according to the Democrats plan  theyll get to be Mugabe Thats Hillarys dream.

"Reprinted from Palestinian Media Watch . Fatah has posted several childrens drawings on Facebook. The drawings clearly show the success of PA and Fatah brainwashing children to believe that Israel only seeks to harm them, violence is good and that all of Israel really is Palestine. Labeling the drawings innocent drawings that express the feelings of children of #Palestine, Fatah posted the drawing above showing Israel, as indicated by a Star of David, eating a Palestinian body wrapped in the Palestinian flag. Blood is seen coming from the body, and a glass of blood is next to the plate.Another drawing by a Palestinian child showed a crucified woman wearing the colors of the Palestinian flag, with her body in the shape of the PA map of Palestine that presents all of Israel as Palestine together with the PA areas. The crucifixion also repeats the analogy that Palestinians are Martyr victims like Jesus . Yet other drawings showed support for violence as legitimate means of Palestinian opposition to Israel. One child drew a Palestinian with a slingshot, another drew a hand with a rifle see below. These drawings echo the PA and Fatahs encouragement of the use of violence against Israel and their glorification of terrorists as heroes. Palestinian Media Watch documented that summer camps organized by the PA Ministry of Education and the PLO educated children to see terrorist stabbers as role models . Other drawings repeated the world view that all of Israel is Palestine, showing the PA map of Palestine which completely erases the existence of Israel and its legitimacy see below. This message is repeated endlessly by the PA and Fatah. Children are told that  it will all return to us  on kids TV programs. The PA National Security Forces regularly post photos from all over Israel presenting the places as Palestine, and even crossword puzzles portray Israeli cities as occupied Palestine. The PAs exploitation of Palestinian childrens innocence is precisely what PMW has been highlighting and warning about for years. The PA and Fatah repeatedly demonize Israel as a monster whose only intention is to harm Palestinians. Israel is  Satan with a tail  on PA TV childrens programs and  Satans project  fighting Allahs project in sermons delivered by Mahmoud Abbas advisor. Similarly, Palestinian terrorist murderers are being portrayed as innocent victims of alleged Israeli  executions . A few of the drawings included doves, some calling for peace and freedom. A major focus of Palestinian Authority policy today is to demand freedom for all imprisoned Palestinian terrorists including murderers. One drawing specifies Freedom for Ahmad Manasrah  a child terrorist who stabbed and critically wounded two Israelis, one of them a 13yearold boy.",hate
"45 Weird Bans on Women in Iran Gender apartheid in the Islamic Republic.

Millions of women, including my relatives in Iran and Syria, continue to face these injustices. Some of the following rules, which are derived from Irans Islamic constitution and moral police codes, were recently reported on by Deutsche Welle Farsi . They exist in may other Islamic countries as well 1. Women are prohibited from taking selfies with soccer players. Specifically, Irans moral committee has banned women from taking selfies with famous soccer players. 2. Iranian women are prohibited from riding bicycles. Irans Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recently issued an Islamic fatwa regarding officially banning women from riding bicycles. He argued that riding bicycles often attracts the attention of men and exposes the society to corruption, and thus contravenes womens chastity, and it must be abandoned, according to Irans staterun media. 3. Coffee shops are prohibited from hiring women. According to Irans police, women are banned from working in any cafs. 4. Iranian Muslim women cannot marry nonMuslim men. But Iranian Muslim men can marry nonMuslim women. 5. It is forbidden for women to wear boots over their pants. Why I am not sure what is Irans Islamic logic behind this. 6. Women are not allowed to wear hats instead of veils to cover their hair. 7. Women are not allowed to wear tight clothes that show their body curves. 8. Women are prohibited from wearing tight clothes for swimming. 9. Women are forbidden from changing their religion or criticizing Muhammad, Allah, the Supreme Leader and other Muslim leaders. 10. Women are prohibited from entering sport stadiums and watching mens sports. 11. In Iran, buses and subways are divided in two sections. The larger front section is for men, the smaller back section is for women. Women are prohibited from entering the mens section even if there are no seats left in the back and there are plenty of empty seats in front of the bus. 12. According to Irans moral police, women are banned from wearing leggings. 13. Women are prohibited from showing strands of their hair on any side. Article 683 states Those women that appear in the streets and public places without the Islamic hijab, shall be sentenced from ten days to two months imprisonment or fined from fifty thousand to five hundred thousand Rials. 14. Women are banned from going camping with men. 15. Any kind of contraceptive surgery is not allowed for women. 16. Women are banned from entering coffeehouses or smoking hookah. 17.

They also cannot obtain a passport without the consent of their husbands. 19. Women are banned from wearing clothes with writing on them. 20. Women are banned from taking their hijab off in any sport event, including in the Olympics. 21. Iranian women are prohibited from pursuing education in some academic fields. Iranian regimes oil minister argued that education of women in the field of operations such as drilling and processing and so on that require physical activities in operational areas and sites is useless and these are masculine mens jobs. 22. Women are not allowed to work in any occupation if their husband disagrees with it. Article 1105 of the Civil Code states, In relations between husband and wife, the position of the head of the family exclusively belongs to the husband. In addition, when it comes to employment laws, Article 1117 of the Civil Code indicates, The husband can prevent his wife from an occupation or technical profession which is incompatible with the familys interests or the dignity of him or his wife. 23. Women are banned from receiving the same amount of inheritance as their male relatives. Even if a husband dies, the wife will receive only oneeighth of the inheritance if she has a child. 24. Women are forbidden from having any physical contact with men, including shaking hands. 25. Women are banned from becoming a Supreme Leader. 26. Girls, as young as 9 years old, are not allowed to object to their parents decision to marry them off. 27. Women are not allowed to object to their husbands requests for sex. The law of Tamkin means womens submission, obedience, full accessibility and unhampered sexual availability to her husband. Sexual availability is considered a womans duty and a mans right. 28. Women are not allowed to bring lawsuits if they are raped, unless they have four witnesses. 29. Women are banned from socializing or dating men. 30. Women are banned from attracting attention in public through flamboyant behavior such as laughing loudly. 31. Women are not allowed to show any part of their skin except the face.

Women are banned from being judges. 44. Women are banned from striking their husband, but men are allowed to do so in some circumstances. 45. Women are not allowed to show their jewelry in public. Some women continue to defy these rules, but many face severe punishment and discrimination for performing some of these normal daytoday activities. We need to raise our voice in helping Muslim women in Iran and other Muslim countries who desire to experience freedom, social justice, equality, and do not want to be subjugated, dehumanized, treated as second class citizens, or solely as sexual toys for men.",hate
"Hillary Clinton Tops Islamist Money in Politics List   There are some very dubious awards out there that you just dont want to win. Being one of the top recipients of Islamic money in politics certainly tops that list. Hillary Clinton likes to complain about dark money. This is as dark as money gets. As the Middle East Forums research shows . Hillary Clinton tops the list, raking in 41,165 from prominent Islamists. This includes 19,249 from senior officials of the Council on AmericanIslamic Relations CAIR, declared a terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates on November 15, 2014. For example, Mrs. Clinton has accepted 3,900 from former CAIR vicechairman Ahmad AlAkhras, who has defended numerous Islamists in Ohio indicted  and later convicted  on terrorism charges. Among other current presidential candidates, Jill Stein has accepted 250. Donald Trump and Gary Johnson have not received any Islamist money. Other top recent recipients of money from the enemy include Rep. Keith Ellison 17,370 and Rep. Andre Carson 13,225. The top ten list includes nine Democrats, one independent Sen. Bernie Sanders accepted 9,285, and no Republicans. I dont think thats too surprising to anyone. Though you have to feel sorry for Jill Stein. She hates Israel and announced she wouldnt have killed Osama bin Laden. Whats a girl gotta do to get ahead on Jihad Street anyway",hate
"Obama Used Religious Test to Favor Muslims Over Christians   We saw the statistical outcomes with the refugee numbers where the vast majority of Syrian refugees were Muslims with hardly any Christians at all. Now we have a snapshot of how that same bias worked with jobs. According to an email chain from 2008, John Podesta received lists of exclusively Muslims and Asians to be considered for jobs in the Obama administration. The email chain revealed that in this process, Middle Eastern Christians were purposefully excluded, or set aside in a separate list, with an aide writing, In the candidates for top jobs, I excluded those with some Arab American background but who are not Muslim e.g., George Mitchell. Many Lebanese Americans, for example, are Christian. In the last list of outside boards/commissions, most who are listed appear to be Muslim American, except that a handful where noted may be Arab American but of uncertain religion esp. Christian. Remember all that outrage over how unAmerican religious tests are Religious tests that preference Muslims are how Obama Inc. does business. Note especially the uncertain religion part. This is how religious tests work.",hate
"Bill Clinton Inc Billions for the Foundation, 116 Million for the Clintons October 27, 2016 Call it the unintended revenge of Doug Band. Band used to be Bills Huma, the guy that the big guy couldnt go to the bathroom without, let alone perform the simplest tasks. The Clinton Foundation was a Band project. The waters grew murkier, but the recent email leaks revealed a rather devastating Doug Band memo on how he was making money for the whole infrastructure of what he called, running Bill Clinton Inc. And Band was also organizing personal income directly for Clinton. Under the heading, ForProfit Activity of President Clinton i.e. Bill Clinton, Inc., Band wrote, We have dedicated our selves to helping the President secure and engage in forprofit activitiesincluding speeches, books, and advisory service engagements In support of the Presidents forprofit activity, we also have solicited and obtained, as appropriate, inkind services for the President and his familyfor personal travel, hospitality, vacation and the like. Neither Justin nor I are separately compensated for these activities e.g., we do not receive a fee for, or percentage of, the more than 50 million in forprofit activity we have personally helped to secure for President Clinton to date or the 66 million in future contracts, should he choose to continue with those engagements. Band mentions four such arrangements without naming them. Bill Clinton was paid nearly 18 million to be honorary chancellor of a forprofit college, Laureate International Universities, according to reports and the familys tax returns. A Dubaibased firm, GEMS Education, paid Bill Clinton more than 560,000 in 2015, according to the tax returns. Band also lists a variety of speaking fees, previously disclosed by the Clintons, including hundreds of thousands of dollars each from UBS, Ericsson, BHP and Barclays. In 2011 alone, according to the Clintons tax returns, Bill Clinton earned 13,454,000 in speaking fees. Of course there was lots of synergy between the for profit stuff and the non profit stuff, between Dougs Teneo interests and the entire Clintonworld octopus. We have dedicated ourselves to helping the President secure and engage in forprofit activities, Band wrote. He also said he had sought to leverage my activities, including my partner role at Teneo, to support and to raise funds for the foundation. Bands memo provided data showing how much money each of Teneos 20 clients at the time had given to the Clinton Foundation, how much they had paid Bill Clinton and, in some cases, how he or Kelly had personally forged the relationships that resulted in the payments. Band wrote that Teneo partners had raised in excess of 8 million for the foundation and 3 million in paid speaking fees for Bill Clinton. He said he had secured contracts for the former president that would pay out 66 million over the subsequent nine years if the deals remained in place. Band also described how Kelly helped expand a fruitful relationship with UBS Global Wealth Management, introducing Bill Clinton to a top executive at a 2009 charity dinner. In the ensuing years, UBS upped its giving to the foundation, signed on as a Teneo client and agreed to pay Bill Clinton for speeches, Band wrote. Band was actually making the case that the entire network of the Clinton Foundation is completely entangled with the private financial interests of the Clintons. Not to mention the interests of people around them. Banks and major corporations were doing business with Bills toady, paying Bill money and donating to the Clinton Foundation through arrangements made by the party of the first part, Band described in the memo how he combined his work for CGI and Teneo. He wrote that he had used a hotel room upstairs from the 2011 CGI gathering to meet with Teneo clients. He also acknowledged giving free CGI memberships to target Teneo clients being cultivated as potential foundation donors. Memberships generally cost 20,000 a year. Teneo, meanwhile, named Bill Clinton its honorary chairman. Clinton had been initially tapped for a threeyear arrangement in which he would provide advice to Teneo regarding geopolitical, economic and social trends, according to a separate June 2011 memo that Band wrote to the State Department seeking ethics approval for the former presidents employment. Bill Clinton was initially paid 2 million by Teneo, according to Man of the World, a book written with the former presidents participation by author Joe Conason. And heres where it gets appropriately entertaining. But Band outlined that Kelly, his Teneo cofounder, had served simultaneously between 2009 and 2011 as an unpaid economic envoy to Northern Ireland appointed by thenSecretary of State Hillary Clinton and as head of a separate consulting company whose clients included Coke, UBS and Dow. Band wrote that the arrangement was consistent with Kellys State Department ethics agreement. Kellys multiple roles came together during one State Department event in 2010, when thenSecretary Clinton recognized Dow, among other companies, for creating jobs in Northern Ireland and thanked Kelly for his work on the issue. Dow became one of Teneos first major clients. According to Bands memo, Dow chief executive Andrew Liveris had been introduced to Bill Clinton over a round of golf with Kelly in August 2009. Thats not consistent with mafia ethics agreements, but its all good in Clintonworld.",hate
"Wife of FBI Official Investigating Hillary Got 500K from Hillary Allied PAC October 27, 2016 Daniel Greenfield The system is broken. Its deeply corrupted by insider politics . The situation at the center of power has reached the point of utter unaccountability. Insider politics function as a shadow government. That needs to change. Restoring America requires dismantling much of the Federal government not only for Constitutional reasons, but because its a simple matter of saving the Republic. Hillary Clinton headlined a major fundraiser for a political action committee shortly before the group steered nearly 500,000 to the wife of the FBI official who oversaw the Clinton email investigation, DailyMail.com has learned. Clintons ties to the Common Good VA  a Virginia state PAC run by Clintons longtime friend and advisor Terry McAuliffe, its governor  came under scrutiny this week after the Wall Street Journal reported that the group donated heavily to the state senate campaign of Jill McCabe. Her husband Andrew McCabe led the FBI investigation into Clintons emails. Andrew McCabe, now the deputy director of the FBI, told the Wall Street Journal that he complied with federal ethics rules and was not promoted to lead the Clinton probe until months after his wifes unsuccessful state senate bid ended. Common Good VA was the largest single donor to Jill McCabes campaign, election records show, giving her 467,000 between June and October of 2015. She was the thirdlargest recipient of money from the group, which can only contribute to Virginia state candidates. Her campaign also received an additional 207,788 from the Democratic Party of Virginia, a group over which McAuliffe exerts significant control. Combined, the money made up nearly onethird of her total funding. Now McCabe, a pediatrician, suddenly decided to run for public office. Unopposed. That was certainly nice of the Dems to not only put a first timer unopposed, but to throw piles and piles of cash at her. And some of that cash was coming from a key former Clinton Foundation man at the center of the latest Foundation scandal. Although Common Good VA is only allowed to fund statelevel candidates, many of its largest donations came from outside of Virginia  including 50,000 from Clinton Foundation official Doug Band in New York, 100,000 from Clinton loyalist Robert Johnson in Maryland, and 10,000 from Clinton megadonor Stephen Cloobeck in Nevada. In the following months, Common Good VA received several major donations from other close Clinton associates, including 100,000 from Bill Clintons business partner Ron Burkle in California and 50,000 from Ready for Hillarys finance committee member Leonard Lauder in New York. There are basic conflicts here. Someone this linked to the Clinton network should never have been investigating Hillary regardless of the dates and timing. But this is exactly what happened with Benghazi.",hate
"Reprinted from Spectator.org . Tom Hayden, the Vietnam War protester and SDS founder, died this past weekend at age 76. Haydens journey was in many ways tragic. Born December 1939 in the Detroit suburbs, he was not, unlike many radical leaders, a reddiaper baby. His parents were Irish Catholics who named him after St. Thomas Aquinas and sent him to Catholic school. His father was a Marine who worked for Chrysler, and an abusive drunk. Haydens parents had a rocky marriage and divorced when he was a boy, which affected him terribly. Haydens friend and exradical, David Horowitz, observed that Hayden harbored what Irving Howe once described as an obscure personal rage, possibly from his estrangement from his father. Tom was indeed an angry man, wrote Horowitz, who seemed in perpetual search of enemies. Hayden channeled that anger into a group that did much damage to America, and was the antithesis of anything that Thomas Aquinas would have ever imagined SDS, Students for a Democratic Society. Hayden will be forever young and forever a hippie in the memories of many Americans, the snarling activist who married Hanoi Jane Fonda and literally wrote the script for SDS. Hayden wrote SDSs manifesto, its founding Port Huron Statement, which Haydens creampuff obituary in the Washington Post generously referred to as an expansive utopian manifesto that extolled participatory democracy as an antidote to the complacency and conformity of the Eisenhower decade. Right. Haydens odd expressions of participatory democracy included another writing he scribbled an infamous June 4, 1968 letter wishing Good fortune and Victory to the North Vietnamese colonels who were killing American boys in Southeast Asia  using the same kind of artillery that Haydens sweetheart Jane posed beside in her stint as a Viet Cong covergirl. That was just one of countless disturbing actions by Tom Hayden at the time, all of which todays leftists merrily sweep under the rug as they uphold him as a crusader for civil rights and of course social justice. But not etched in our memory was what might have been Tom Haydens swan song long after his and his wifes cheerleading for the Viet Cong namely, the document that he wrote for our President of Fundamental Transformation. Few know this, but Hayden was a founder of another group of destructive forces, a group called Progressives for Obama. The groups members came together in 2008, coalescing around the only Democratic presidential nominee in their lifetimes who was farleft enough for them to support. They constituted a Whos Who of the 60s SDS crowd. Among the nearly 100 formal signers to Progressives for Obama were Mark Rudd, Carl Davidson, Jane Fonda, Thorne Dreyer, Daniel Ellsberg, Richard Flacks, John McAuliff, Jay Schaffner, and more. Columbia University was naturally wellrepresented, if not through the likes of Rudd, who shut down the campus in 1968, then through current faculty such as Todd Gitlin, a former SDS president who today is professor of journalism, sociology, and chair of Columbias doctoral program in communications. Whereas the likes of Obama friends Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn were thrust into the national spotlight in 2008 by conservatives like Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity, Progressives for Obama flew under the radar, largely unnoticed even by the right. Appropriately, spearheading Progressives for Obama was the man who had spearheaded SDS. Tom Hayden was one of the four initiators of Progressives for Obama, along with Barbara Ehrenreich, Bill Fletcher, Jr., and Danny Glover. It is no exaggeration to say that the signers list of Progressives for Obama resembled the roster of SDSers called to testify before Congress in December 1969 for their subversive activities. Aside from the likes of Hayden, Rudd, and Davidson, other SDSers among Progressives for Obama were Bob Pardun, who was SDS education secretary from 196667, and Paul Buhle, a professor who has recently sought to revive SDS. Among these names from the insane 60s, all were fired up in 2008 over the unique opportunity that a fellow farleft radical, one Barack Obama, offered. They saw Obama as a golden chance, a onceinalifetime moment, and they got it on November 4, 2008. Obama won the day, and they at last won the day, too. And therein, among the Progressives for Obama, the testimony of leader Tom Hayden was especially revealing. Understand that after his early life establishing SDS, meeting with and expressing Good fortune and Victory to the Viet Cong, and vigorously protesting the American system, Hayden went into politics, professional activism, and education. Like his erstwhile SDS brethren, Hayden grasped the power of higher education which they have pervaded, and served as a professor at Pitzer College and also at Obamas alma mater, Occidental College. Like Mark Rudd, like Bill Ayers, like Bernardine Dohrn all of them now in higher education, Hayden had come to view a quick revolution of the system as too daunting, if not impossible. He had become much more patient, instead advocating a progressive evolution of slower, measured change . By 2008, he was seeking to advance the progressive cause within the established, mainstream Democratic Party. Of course, Hayden once helped blow up the Democratic Partys national convention in 1968. No matter the party of 2008 was different and warmly accepted him. Hayden was ecstatic over Barack Obamas presidential campaign. He jumped in with both feet, looking to assist wherever he could, with a rush of enthusiasm not seen since his days undermining America in Vietnam. Not one to tinker around, Hayden got to work on a formal organization and unifying statement, as he had done for SDS  once again there at the creation. The man who drafted SDSs pivotal Port Huron statement got to work drafting mission statements for Progressives for Obama. During the 2008 campaign, a touched Hayden was moved to verse over the emergence of Obama. In one article, titled, Obama and the Open and Unexpected Future, written for CommonDreams.org, selfdescribed as a website for Breaking News  Views for the Progressive Community, Hayden mused I didnt see him coming. When I read of the young state senator with a background in community organizing who wanted to be president, I was at least sentient enough to be interested. When I read Dreams of My Father sic, I was taken aback by its depth. This young man apparently gave his first public speech, against South African apartheid, at an Occidental College rally organized by Students for Economic Democracy, the student branch of the Campaign for Economic Democracy which I chaired in 197982. The buds of curiosity quickened. Hayden saw in Obama a longawaited vehicle for economic democracy, an instrument to channel an equal distribution of wealth  economic justice, or redistributive change, as Obama himself had once put it. Hayden wished that, Win or lose, the Obama movement will shape progressive politics for a generation to come. He also hoped that that progressive movement likewise might transform Obama as well. Both could reinforce and shape one another. Hayden wrote that in June 2008. When Obama was elected later the following November, Hayden was beside himself with joy, surely shocked that the American electorate had finally voted for a president that Tom Hayden saw as his kind of president. Once upon a time, traditional Democrats like Haydens parents had shaken their heads in disgust at what Tom and his pals did to their partys convention in Chicago in 1968, at what they did during the Days of Rage the next year, at what they did at Columbia during the student strike, and on and on. But now, by 2008, the Democratic Party was theirs. It belonged to the 60s kiddies. The former SDS founder became particularly vocal in his praise for Obama once the election was over. During the election, the goal was to organize, raise money, but not speak too loudly, out of fear of driving away the moderates and remaining traditional Democrat moms and pops who had worked in the mines and the mills, who joined unions, who clinged to their God and guns, who prayed rosaries and filled churches, who were prolife and antigay marriage. With the presidency now secured, Hayden could open up. Joined by his former comrades at the takenoprisoners website of Progressives for Obama, he began regularly sounding off against Obamas critics  those opposing single payer or the public option in healthcare reform, or government management of General Motors  with the subtlety of a howitzer. With the presidency won, Hayden and his allies were free to express themselves, to demonize healthinsurance companies, the financialservices industry, AIG, the Big Three automakers, or whatever other capitalist reptile Lenins phrase stood in the way of President Obamas desire for reform and mandate for change. In the twoterm presidency of fundamental transformation under Obama, Hayden and friends achieved many of their common dreams. By this election cycle, in 2016, Tom Hayden must have been mesmerized by the revolution he and his fellow radicals had pulled off in the Democratic Party. Alas, it was fitting that Tom Hayden became seriously ill his final stand during a turn for the worse at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia this past summer, where he was striving to ensure that the Democratic Party continue along the radical path of fundamental transformation that he and his allies had been unable to achieve via SDS and the Weather Underground. That path, in the hands of Hillary Clinton, is assured. Today, at long last, for Tom Hayden and friends, the new Democratic Party and the new America is theirs. He can rest in peace, assured that his mission is finally being accomplished.",hate
"Obama Votes Against US at UN October 27, 2016 Daniel Greenfield Obamas abstention from a UN vote against the US is a new low for the most antiAmerican administration in American history. Under Obama, our foreign policy has been reoriented toward damaging our own interests as much as possible. But actively opposing US policy at the UN is a new low. The resolution A/RES/71/5 is on the Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba. It was introduced at the request of Cuba back in 91 with a memorandum that accused America of pursuing an aggressive policy against Cuba with the declared aim of imposing on it the political, social and economic order which the united States authorities consider most fitting. This policy has included direct military intervention, the threat of nuclear annihilation, the instigation and carrying out of countless acts of sabotage and plans to assassinate Cuban leaders. As Obamas creepy toady Ben Rhodes tweeted, No reason to vote to defend a failed policy we oppose. Except the failed policy is that of the United States. By we, Rhodes means that Obama and the left arent going to defend the United States in international forums when they disagree with the US. All this is yet another reminder that the people running the country are not of the country. Theyre a hostile foreign ideology that sees itself as separate from the United States and does not believe it has any responsibilities toward the United States. At the UN, Samantha Power took the antiAmerican positions to applause from a UN united with Obama against America. For more than 50 years, the United States had a policy aimed at isolating the government of Cuba. For roughly half of those years, UN Member States have voted overwhelmingly for a General Assembly resolution that condemns the U.S. embargo and calls for it to be ended. The United States has always voted against this resolution. Today the United States will abstain. Applause. Thank you.  This is treason.",hate
"ObamaCare is Great. We Just Need to Punish People for Not Using It October 27, 2016 But...but... I thought we were trying to help people. ObamaCare visionary Jonathan Stupidity of the American Voter Gruber is back. When last we heard from the man with the same name as the Die Hard villain, he was being ushered off the scene after explaining how stupid everyone was . An architect of the federal healthcare law said last year that a lack of transparency and the stupidity of the American voter helped Congress approve ObamaCare. In a clip unearthed Sunday, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor Jonathan Gruber appears on a panel and discusses how the reform earned enough votes to pass. He suggested that many lawmakers and voters didnt know what was in the law or how its financing worked, and that this helped it win approval. Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage, Gruber said. And basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical for the thing to pass. Gruber made the comment while discussing how the law was written in a tortured way to avoid a bad score from the Congressional Budget Office. He suggested that voters would have rejected ObamaCare if the penalties for going without health insurance were interpreted as taxes, either by budget analysts or the public. If CBO scored the individual mandate as taxes, the bill dies, Gruber said. Now the Gruber is back... and ready to explain why the only problem with ObamaCare is the lack of severe beatings . There is no sense in which the law has to be fixed. The law is working as designed. However, it could work better. And I think probably the most important thing experts would agree on is that, we need a larger mandate penalty. We have individuals who are essentially freeriding on the system, theyre essentially waiting until they get sick and then getting health insurance. The whole idea of this plan, which was pioneered in Massachusetts, was that the individual mandate penalty would bring those people into the system and have them participate. The penalty right now is probably too low, and thats something I think ideally we would fix. Ideally we would penalize Gruber and everyone involved in inflicting this monstrosity on the public. But predictably Grubers proposal is to offer up more beatings until morale improves. While pretending that anyone who isnt on ObamaCare is just a free rider.",hate
"Search The Left in Power  Clinton to Obama David Horowitz explains how the Democrats became a leftwing party in Volume VII of the Black Book of the American Left. October 28, 2016 Richard Baehr Below is Richard Baehrs review of David Horowitzs new book, The Left in Power Clinton to Obama reprinted from American Thinker with permission. The book is volume 7 of The Black Book of the American Left , a multivolume collection of David Horowitzs conservative writings that will, when completed, be the most ambitious effort ever undertaken to define the Left and its agenda. Order HERE . We encourage our readers to visit BlackBookOfTheAmericanLeft.com which features Horowitzs introductions to Volumes 17 of this 9volume series, along with their tables of contents, reviews and interviews with the author. Every year, there is some report of the blissful ignorance of American history demonstrated by the supposedly best and brightest at elite American universities. Suffice it to say the collected writings of David Horowitz on the American Left, which constitute part of a solid foundation for understanding the last half century of American politics, are nowhere to be found on any college or high school reading list. Horowitzs latest book, The Left in Power Clinton to Obama , is the seventh volume in his ninevolume collection, The Black Book of the American Left . This new volume provides a collection of his writings over the last quarter century, focusing primarily on the Lefts control in our government and culture. As Horowitz reveals, even during the Bush years, conservatives were on the defense and leftists controlled the narrative as they attempted to destroy Bush and his chances for reelection in 2004. Their primary mode of attack was to undermine Americas efforts in Iraq almost from the start of the conflict, when just months earlier a majority of Senate Democrats and near half of House Democrats had supported the President. The Left then destroyed Bushs second term with bogus charges of racist neglect in the handling of Hurricane Katrina. There was plenty of incompetence in the response to Katrina, but local and state officials  all Democrats, of course, and many of them African American  were the principal operators on the ground during the crisis. The immediate abandonment of support for the Iraq war effort was a signal event in American history, sending a message that a large part of the Democratic Party was not remotely concerned about the morale of our men and women fighting overseas. The weak effort by some Democrats to hold onto an ounce of patriotic resolve  end the war, support the troops  was designed more for campaign speeches than any meaningful attempt to convey national unity for the effort underway by our armed forces. So too, the obsession with Abu Ghraib gave the lie to the Democrats support our troops message, as a broad brush was used to paint the incident as somehow what you would expect from our military on a routine basis. Horowitz outlines this narrative, faulting the Bush administration for failing to fight harder to present its story of why we went into Iraq and the risks if we had done nothing. Regrettably, the Bush administration never had a chance to get a better defense of the Iraq war out to the media. Most in the media considered the Bush administration illegitimate due to its narrow victory in the 2000 presidential contest, a lie to be sure . Unfortunately, it is almost certainly true that the media today are far more in the bag for the left than ten or twenty years ago and work harder at pushing the lefts agenda. The soft liberalism of Walter Cronkite has been replaced by cable and national network anchors who routinely bury stories embarrassing to their side and focus on those that can do damage to the other side. During the current Presidential election cycle, we have seen the most prestigious media organs explain why it is necessary and appropriate for them to be biased this year. It is a special time, they argue, because Trump is, in their view, a unique threat to the Republic. On the other hand, the media have been loath to consider the damage to the country caused by Barack Obama  the loss of respect abroad for Americas will to fight, the degradation of our military readiness, the fraying of ties with allies, and the near obsessive outreach to Americas enemies that led to agreements such as the nuclear deal with Iran, best described as an abject surrender of American interests that will lead to the funding of fanatical nuclear regime. About 85 of those supposedly sensible proIsrael Democrats walked the plank behind their great leader on that deal, with no visible regrets to date. There was simply too much political risk to oppose the first black president of their party. The media were happy to parrot the administrations talking points for the nuclear deal, something the manipulators crowed over at the White House. At least in the propaganda use of Abu Ghraib, the Left was honest in revealing what it thinks about the military. As Horowitz outlines in article after article, the Left is fighting a war that most Americans do not see, disguising its intentions through its aggressive, unceasing promotion of progressive policies to make America a better place. This commitment to deception emerges, Horowitz reveals, from the allegiance to the ideology of Saul Alinskys Rules for Radicals, a formative doctrine for both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. The progressive goal is to achieve a new society that has never been seen before in this country, though it has been promised and has catastrophically failed in many places around the globe. In America, the Left is not only unconcerned with selling their program to the public, but also, Horowitz argues, it is fearful of the result of voters knowing what it is pursuing. One prime example was the admission of MIT professor and Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber that health care law would never have made it through Congress if it had been presented honestly. The Left is also busy at work making it easier for itself to win politically. Horowitz provides chapter and verse on the Lefts efforts to rapidly change the composition of the voting pool  motor voter registration with no birth certificate required, fighting every effort to combat voter fraud with charges of racism and turning the clock back, even when states were willing to pay for potential voters obtaining the needed documents to register, support for open borders, expansion of legal immigration, and amnesty and citizenship and voting rights for more than ten million already in the country illegally. Here the Lefts mentor and financier is George Soros and his buddies, who have funded dozens of organizations which fight on multiple fronts every day to advance the left politically. And Horowitz has done a great public service by his Discover the Network listing of the people responsible for Americas steady drift to the radical Left. The Left uses the racism charge in many of the confrontations it creates. Of course, the problems of Americas inner cities, all under complete control of one political party for half a century, have never been of even near equal interest to the Democrats as their ability to continue to win enormous majorities among inner city voters, particularly African Americans. The Left has fully endorsed the teacher unions opposition to charter schools, and voucher programs, though both are popular with minority group parents and children. The two major teachers unions are simply too powerful a support group for the Democratic Party campaign cash, votes, and volunteers for the Left to support policies that might lead to a better future for kids as opposed to continued growth in expenditures for the teachers unions and their workforce. In the last two years, the Sorosfunded Black Lives Matter movement has created a near national hysteria over the alleged systematic effort by police to kill unarmed black men. Between two and three dozen unarmed blacks are killed by cops each year, many of them in situations where the victims were almost certainly responsible for what happened to them  Michael Brown in Ferguson is a prime example. One wonders where the news media are to report on the police shooting of unarmed whites, which greatly outnumber those of unarmed blacks. Perhaps because there are no riots, or looting, these incidents have no cachet. More likely, they do not fit the systemic racism charge now routinely thrown around by everyone from the current President to Hillary Clinton. In Chicago in 9 months this year, over 400 blacks, mostly men, have been shot and killed, almost exclusively by other black men. By year end, over 4,000 Chicagoans will have been shot. One might think this was a bigger story of urban calamity and civil society breakdown than a shooting in Charlotte. Chicagos mayor says that police have gone fetal, avoiding making stops in crime ridden neighborhoods, with the ACLU looking over their shoulder demanding a report for every stop, and activists in the neighborhoods treating the police with scorn and abuse, following a bad police shooting captured on video and kept hidden from the public by Chicagos mayor to protect his reelection bid. Rahm Emanuel must also have read Alinsky, for he knows whose hide to protect first and foremost. The victims of the police pullback in Chicago, Baltimore, St, Louis and other cities, called the Ferguson effect, are many more dead black men, killed in crime waves that are reminiscent of the 1990s. Even the FBI Director admits the Ferguson Effect is real, when not covering for Hillary Clinton. Horowitz latest book is full of insights and straight talk on the goals and the mission of the Left, and how it has advanced its cause this last quarter century. He provides the kind of arguments that keep his books from getting reviewed by the New York Times. And there is always a horrible slur available from the Left to describe a viewpoint that counters one of its missions. The Left chooses to ignore the argument and uses character assassination for the people making it. It argues that these are people Horowitz included unworthy of serious consideration, or respect. Silencing the critic or the dissident or limiting his visibility has been a long time weapon of the Left. So far, Horowitz keeps writing, and America is free enough that the Left, though it clearly wants to, cannot ban his books. George Soros and his family have another 20 billion to spend on changing America. The Alinsky acolytes have their mission laid out to make use of the funds and create an America where the smart bureaucrats can organize society and distribute its wealth, so results are all equal. And we can all sing along with the Pete Seeger songs as we turn away from any role overseas where of course we have primarily been an agent of evil and disinvest in defense every year. Lets hope that some of Americas young will read Horowitz books,and learn what their professors and teachers wont teach them.",hate
"An eyebrowraising new study from a nonpartisan research institute. October 28, 2016 Matthew Vadum The Obama administration is using billions of dollars in banking fines to fund radical leftwing activist groups that work to elect Democrats, according to an eyeopening new study from a nonpartisan research institute. During Eric Holders term as attorney general from February 2009 through April 2015, a little under 37.3 billion was paid by U.S. banks under the threat of federal lawsuits. All but 720 million of that sum came from three big settlements Bank of America, Citigroup, and JP Morgan Chase. Many of the cases rest on bogus disparate impact theory which leftwing government lawyers use to make sure that banks become liable for charges of racism based upon the perceived injustice of lending disparity in certain lower income areas, regardless of the reasons for the disparity. Instead of being used to help the supposed victims of these banks, the money flows to leftist allies of President Obama. Adding insult to injury, the process by which the money snakes its way to leftwing organizations is both corrupt and unconstitutional, according to the report from the Government Accountability Institute that is called Follow the Money How the Department of Justice Funds Progressive Activists. Bestselling Clinton Cash author and anticorruption crusader Peter Schweizer is GAIs president. The full 115page report is available in PDF form here . The report states The Department of Justice has curated an opaque system wherein appointed attorneys can legally extract money from the private sector and redistribute the funds to thirdparty organizations outside of the appropriations processan unprecedented and extraordinary disregard for Congressional authority. It adds, these funds directed by the DOJ effectively replaced funding to activist nonprofits previously denied by Congress. Much of the cash moves through NeighborWorks. The nonprofit gave more than 53 million to the rabblerousing group Neighborhood Assistance Corp. of America NACA whose leader, Bruce Marks, calls himself a bank terrorist. It also gave over 4 million to Asian Americans for Equality AAFE, an organization with communist roots and continued close ties to a very vocal North Korean sympathizer. The illgotten funds extorted from the banks also trickle down to leftwing groups such as National Council of La Raza, NHS of Chicago, National Urban League, and Operation HOPE. Many of the nonprofits that receive such funding spend the money to elect Democrats. Catalist, a George Sorosfunded forprofit data analytics company specializing in leftprogressive causes, along with a group called Nonprofit VOTE mobilize these federally funded nonprofits  to get the vote out for those who tend to be reliably progressive, the report states. Catalist was founded by former Bill Clinton aide Harold Ickes in 2006 following Democrats electoral wipeout in 2004. Leftwing activists believed Republicans owed George W. Bushs reelection victory to heavy spending on voter contact technology, including databases. According to a Capital Research Center report  Catalist boasts it was vital to President Obamas 2008 victory. By its own admission, over 90 organizations, campaigns and committees used the companys services. Based on data that was loaded into the Catalist databases and then standardized, a Catalist analysis of the 2008 cycle says, progressive organizations, the Obama campaign, and federal party committees attempted to contact more than 106 million people. This means that the progressive community attempted to contact over 46 of the U.S. adult population. Contacts were delivered inperson, over the phone, by mail and over the internet. Of course, leeching off others is generally how the activist Left funds itself. Apart from oceans of cash supplied by leftwing fatcat megadonors like George Soros and Michael Bloomberg and a galaxy of radical foundations, the Left derives its sustenance by ripping off taxpayers at the federal, state, and local levels. The report states the evidence shows the Left is using the Department of Justice and the power of the federal government to extract money from financial institutions for redistribution to progressive activists whose real intent is far more partisan than the housing and housing education for which they ostensibly exist. In other words, the Left plays by a different set of rules than the rest of America. There is no level socalled playing field in American electoral politics. In a sense the system is rigged. There is the parasitic Left feeding at the taxpayer trough versus everybody else. Conservatives knew about this travesty already but few studies have been put together that follow the money trail. For a half century, the Left has been using taxpayer dollars to fund efforts to advance radical, subversive causes in the United States. Changes in federal social policy in the mid1960s helped lay the groundwork for this insidious leftist astroturfing. Under the profoundly antisocial War on Poverty, the federal government has been handing out taxpayer money since 1965 to liberal and radical socalled community organizations to help them agitate against the status quo. One could say America declared war on itself and conscripted Saul Alinskyinspired pressure groups to do the fighting. In recent decades those on the Left  including groups like ACORN and moneygrubbing con artists like Jesse Jackson Sr.  have also become quite adept at working outside the public sector to shake down banks and other businesses to fill their war chests. Conservative groups receive no such largesse from Uncle Sam and in fairness, many such organizations would likely reject government funding on principle if offered it. This sueandsettle corruption will undoubtedly continue if Hillary Clinton becomes president. Secretary of Labor Tom Perez , no stranger to the shakedown business himself, is said to be a top contender for the attorney general post in any new Clinton administration. Perez, who previously ran the DoJs Civil Rights Division, is also a past president of Casa de Maryland, a notorious advocacy group for illegal aliens funded by George Soros and the late Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez. The moneyraising scam described in the GAI report isnt the only way leftwing groups fill up their bank accounts. Activist groups were encouraged to agitate by the Carterera Community Reinvestment Act, which enshrined in law a kind of lending protection racket. Banking regulators who had come under the influence of groups like ACORN had the power to make trouble for banks that failed to lend enough money to borrowers in socalled underserved communities. Banks that paid enough  whatever that means  got left alone, but banks that didnt, got their legs broken. Few serious economists doubt that the mortgage market debacle and the economic collapse of 2008 were caused by the deliberate weakening of underwriting standards carried out in the name of ending discrimination. Leftists played both sides. They called banks racist and demanded more subprime lending for minorities and then when the loans went bad called the banks racist for supposedly targeting minority borrowers. It was and is pure gangsterism. Through the magic of dysphemism, the once sought after subprime lending was transformed into predatory lending. The shaking down of lenders intensified when thenTreasury Secretary Robert Rubin presided over the Clinton administrations effort to put the CRA on steroids. Banks began to make risky subprime loans and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac aggregated them for sale in the secondary market as mortgagebacked securities. These practices made it easier for banks to give in to the demands of ACORN and other groups to originate more and more doomed mortgages because they knew they could offload their highrisk debt on quasigovernmental suckers Fannie and Freddie, which were under intense political pressure to service the subprime market. President Clinton turned the Community Reinvestment Act, a onceobscure and lightly enforced banking regulation law, into one of the most powerful mandates shaping American citiesand as Senate Banking Committee chairman Phil Gramm memorably put it, a vast extortion scheme against the nations banks, Howard Husock of the Manhattan Institute wrote in City Journal . When Husock wrote in 2000, U.S. banks had committed nearly 1 trillion for innercity and lowincome mortgages and real estate development projects, most of it funneled through a nationwide network of leftwing community groups, intent, in some cases, on teaching their lowincome clients that the financial system is their enemy and, implicitly, that government, rather than their own striving, is the key to their wellbeing. Enterprising leftwing levelers never tire of dreaming up these redistribution schemes. And they never will.",hate
"Search What Will Replace ISIS This is a war to determine whether the future will belong to the West or to Islam. October 28, 2016 Daniel Greenfield Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. Before long the same administration that declared the fighting in Iraq over several times will claim victory over ISIS. The timetable for its push against the Islamic State appears to have less do with the victimized Christians and Yazidis who have been prevented from coming here as refugees in favor of Syrian Muslims than with the Clinton presidential campaign. Like Obamas declarations that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were over, the announcement that ISIS has been defeated will be premature. It is based on a profound misunderstanding and misreading of Islamic terrorism. Long before its current string of defeats, ISIS had begun evolving into another Al Qaeda a multinational alliance of Jihadists scattered around the world. Bombing Mosul isnt hard, but try bombing Marseille, Brussels or London. There is no doubt that the ability of ISIS to temporarily establish a caliphate allowed it to build a network that could carry out terror attacks from New York to Miami to Nice to Munich. But it would be dangerous to assume that losing Iraq and Syria will stop ISIS. ISIS doesnt matter. The idea of ISIS does. And the idea of ISIS is Islamic supremacism. The organization we think of ISIS has transformed and rebranded countless times. Even now our leaders vacillate between calling it ISIS, ISIL or, more childishly, Daesh, while it dubs itself the Islamic State. We have been fighting it in one form or another for over a decade. It would be unrealistically optimistic to assume that the war will end just as this old enemy has shown its ability to strike deep in our own cities. The bigger error though is to think that we are fighting an organization. We are fighting an idea. That is not to contend, as Obama does, that we can debate it to death. It is not the sort of idea that argues with words, but with bullets, bombs and swords. But neither does it just go away if you seize a city. Al Qaeda in Iraq not only survived the death of Zarqawi, but it became even more dangerous under Baghdadi. It would be risky to assume that ISIS will die with him. Instead it may very well grow into a new phase of Al Qaeda, one that ties together some of the worlds deadliest Islamic terror groups into a network that is decentralized enough that it will not suffer from Al Qaedas leadership fatigue. The rise of Islamic terrorism has been an incremental process in which new groups learn from the mistakes of the old and supersede them. If ISIS does recede into a localized oblivion, reemerging only on occasion to suicide bomb something or someone in Baghdad, then a deadlier and even more effective group is likely to take its place. Each group will move one step closer to realizing the caliphate. To break the cycle, we must confront the idea of the caliphate at the heart of Islamic terrorism. ISIS is not unIslamic. It is ruthlessly and uncompromisingly Islamic in that, unlike its predecessors in the Muslim Brotherhood and Al Qaeda, it makes the fewest compromises to civilizational sensibilities. Its goals are the same as those of every Islamic political organization, including those dubbed moderate. It seeks to restore and enforce an Islamic system in every part of the Muslim world before moving on to conquer and subjugate the nonMuslim world. If this were merely some fringe belief held by a tiny minority of extremists, then it could be bombed to pieces in some Syrian or Iraqi backwater. But its the driving force of Islam. Thats why it wont go away. No amount of appeasement will banish it. Taking in more Muslim settlers, pressuring Israel and letting the Muslim Brotherhood colonize our foreign policy wont do it. Weve tried it and it actually makes Islamic terrorism much worse. When the announcement is made, the usual suspects will pat themselves on the back for having defeated ISIS by mobilizing a Muslim coalition. But it wasnt Obama who mobilized a Muslim coalition. The coalition, such as it was, mobilized them. Obama provided useful support to Islamic state sponsors of terror, such as Iran and Turkey, assorted Islamic Jihadists on the ground, some blatantly associated with Sunni and Shiite terror groups in their internal Jihadist conflict with ISIS over who will fight us. The allies we are aiding today will be the ones bombing us tomorrow. And that is why claiming credit for beating ISIS accomplishes nothing. ISIS is an expression of an Islamic impulse encoded in the Koran. Islamic groups differ in the tactical expression of that impulse. ISIS was nastier and uglier than most of the Islamic terror groups we had dealt with before this. Though even it found its Boko Haram affiliate in Nigeria occasionally a little too much to stomach. If ISIS vanishes from the world stage, Islamic terrorism will be easier to dismiss. Or so the thinking goes. The Islamic State was better at viral videos than the media that tried to whitewash Islamic terror. It was hard to ignore. But a scattering of Islamic terror groups around the world will be forgotten by the public. History suggests thats wishful thinking. Islamic terrorism has shown no signs of receding. Growing Muslim populations, both at home and in Muslim settlements in the West, and the increase in travel and communications, the infrastructure of globalism, spread it from the most backward to the most advanced parts of the world. Wealthy and unstable Muslim countries, rich in oil but poor in power, finance its spread through mosques and guns. These are the ingredients that give us ISIS or any other combination or letters that stands for Islamic terror. To do anything meaningful about it, we would have to reverse the decline of the West. Islam originally spread into a vacuum created by civilizational decline. Civilizational decline is why it is rising once again. An obscure local terror group eventually turned into ISIS by filling a power vacuum. Even as Obama performs another touchdown dance, some other group will be making that same journey. Its mission will be the familiar one of replacing our civilization with its own. Until we come to terms with this civilizational struggle, we will go on fighting endless wars in the sand and coping with endless terror attacks in our own cities because we have failed to recognize the nature of the enemy. We are not fighting an acronym, whether its ISIS or ISIL we are fighting an Islamic State. This is a war to determine whether the future will belong to the West or to Islam.",hate
"The SPLCs Libelous New Report on AntiMuslim Extremists Equating counterjihadists with jihadists. Robert Spencer The objective of this libelous new report from the hardLeft moneymaking and incitement machine the Southern Poverty Law Center SPLC is made plain within it Before you book a spokesperson from an antiMuslim extremist group or quote them in a story, research their background  detailed in this indepth guide to 15 of the most visible antiMuslim activists and consider the consequences of giving them a platform. They wish to silence those who speak honestly about the nature and magnitude of the jihad threat, blaming us for a supposed rise in Islamophobia. If they really want to stamp out suspicion of Islam, of course, they will move against not us, but the likes of Omar Mateen, Syed Rizwan Farook, Tashfeen Malik, Nidal Malik Hasan, Mohammed Abdulazeez, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, and the myriad other Muslims who commit violence in the name of Islam and justify it by reference to Islamic teachings. The SPLC doesnt do that because its objective is not really to stop Islamophobia at all, but to create the illusion of a powerful and moneyed network of Islamophobes, who can only be stopped if you write a check to the SPLC. Thats what this is really all about. In constructing this illusory edifice, the SPLC labels me and fourteen others antiMuslim extremists. We are, of course, no more antiMuslim than foes of the Nazis were antiGerman, but note the word extremists. Thats the mainstream media and Obama administrations term of choice for jihad terrorists. In what way are we extremists Has anyone on the SPLCs hit list and given the SPLCs track record of inciting violence against its targets, that is exactly what it is ever blown anything or anyone up Beheaded anyone Boasted of our imminent conquest of any territory and the massacre of or enslavement of its people No, all we have done is speak critically about jihad terror and Sharia oppression. The SPLC is trying to further the libel that we are the other side of the coin, the nonMuslim bin Ladens and Awlakis. Until we commit any terror attacks or conspire with others to do so, however, the SPLCs libel is only that a libel. Its also passingly ironic that the SPLC list includes several people who are doubtless horrified to be in this company, as they have endeavored for years to distinguish their message from that of those whom they themselves would smear as Islamophobes. But their temporizing and pandering didnt work they ended up on the Index of Prohibited Thinkers anyway, as will, ultimately, anyone who dares to note that Islam just might have something to do with the acts of murder committed in its name and in accord with its teachings. The report as a whole stands as an example of the Lefts strange tendency to present true statements as if they were selfevidently false, without bothering to explain why. Apparently the SPLC knows its supporters and is aware that it doesnt need to bother with troublesome things like, you know, facts. The SPLCs hit list recurrently excoriates people for making true statements that it apparently regards as selfevidently false. For example, it says that Ann Corcoran of Refugee Resettlement Watch accuses immigrantrun stores of illegally trafficking in food stamps. This is a case that Corcoran makes with evidence  evidence that the SPLC doesnt bother to try disproving. It says that Steven Emerson of the Investigative Project on Terrorism has claimed that the Obama administration extensively collaborates with the Muslim Brotherhood. That he actually has done so doesnt seem to bother them. As Andrew C. McCarthy has noted , Barack Obama has spent his presidency cultivating Islamists, particularly from the international Muslim Brotherhood and its affiliates in the United States. The SPLC also hits Emerison for having asserted that Europe is riddled with nogo zones. Regarding nogo zones, here are some news articles from just the past few weeks Germany Police sick of citizens nogo zone fears The SPLC excoriates Brigitte Gabriel of ACT for America for saying that any practicing Muslim who believes the word of the Koran to be the word of Allah  who goes to mosque and prays every Friday, who prays five times a day  this practicing Muslim, who believes in the teachings of the Koran, cannot be a loyal citizen of the United States. Yet it says nothing, of course, about the many teachings of the Quran that contradict American Constitutional principles the denial of the freedom of speech, the death penalty for apostasy, the devaluation of women, and more. How to reconcile these teachings with U.S. citizenship, the SPLC did not bother to explain. The SPLC quotes David Horowitz saying There are only a couple of degrees of separation between anybody on the left and the terrorists  and that includes people in the Democratic Party, even those who are antiterrorist. Here again, no refutation is offered  yet the Lefts dalliance with Palestinian jihad groups and overall antiAmericanism make it impossible to dismiss Horowitzs assertion. Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy, were told, is gripped by paranoid fantasies about Muslims destroying the West from within. The SPLC doesnt bother to mention the Explanatory Memorandum on the General Strategic Goal for the Brotherhood in North America , the captured Muslim Brotherhood internal document that explained that Brotherhood members must understand that their work in America is a kind of grand Jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and Gods religion is made victorious over all other religions. In attacking Pamela Geller of the American Freedom Defense Initiative, the SPLC descended to outright fabrications. Notes Geller  Their claim that I insist that Obama is the love child of Malcolm X is patently untrue. The SPLC also states that I have spoken to a neofascist group in Germany, when in fact I have never even been to Germany. It characterizes former FBI agent John Guandolos claim that CIA director John Brennan was a convert to Islam as an outlandish accusation, when in fact a U.S. asset assigned overseas with Brennan in Saudi Arabia when he was station chief confirmed years ago their firsthand account that Brennan was indeed the target of a Saudi intelligence influence operation that led to his conversion. Brennan has also stated publicly that he visited Mecca, which is impossible for a nonMuslim to do unless he is a special guest of the Saudi King. Even more strangely, the SPLC targets Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a woman who grew up as a Muslim in Somalia, suffered genital mutilated at the hands of Muslims, is under death threats from Muslims, and lives in exile from her homeland because of Muslims. Instead of trying to discredit her, the SPLC should be honoring her for her stand for human rights against Sharia oppression. But the SPLC has other priorities. Of me, the SPLC concedes that I am a real intellectual but complains that I am entirely selftaught in the study of Islam. An odd objection. One cannot be both selftaught and a real intellectual In any case, its false I am indeed mostly selftaught in the study of Islam, and make no secret of or apologies for it every days headlines proves me correct. Nonetheless, the fact is that I did first read the Quran and began studying Islam in earnest while at the University of North Carolina. My claims, says the SPLC, are provably false, but then only offers a number of them that are demonstrably true, without any attempt to refute them. It even says that I have referred to Barack Obama as the first Muslim president. This one epitomizes the dishonesty of the SPLC. The quote comes from an article I wrote in 2007 discussing how Obama was not a Muslim, stating that his obvious affinity for Islam and the Muslim world could make him into our first Muslim president the way Bill Clinton was called our first black president. After eight years of Obama, Id say I was proven correct in rather spectacular fashion. The SPLC, finally, hits me for having even suggested that the media may be getting money to depict Muslims in a positive light. The facts are once again deeply unfortunate for the SPLC George Soros funded a report on Islamophobia on Twitter and gave 200,000 to the Center for American Progress for a defamatory report on alleged Islamophobes. He also spent 600,000 for favorable coverage of the Muslim migrant inundation, bought favorable coverage of the Iran deal , and bought Islamophobia propaganda after the San Bernardino jihad massacre. But what need does the SPLC have of facts It knows its readers wont check up on the veracity of its claims, but will accept them at face value, since the SPLC is of the camp of the saints, the enlightened and tolerant Left. Those who are outside that camp clearly have no rights that the SPLC feels bound to respect.",hate
"The Psychopathic and Insincere Jihad Islams natural appeal to criminals, psychopaths, and murderers. October 28, 2016 Raymond Ibrahim is a Shillman Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center. Whenever Muslims engage in behavior that ostensibly contradicts Islamfrom taking drugs and watching porn to killing fellow Muslims Islams apologists loudly proclaim Aha, see, theyre not true Muslims Or, in the words of CIA head John Brennan on the Islamic State They are terrorists, theyre criminals. Mostmanyof them are psychopathic thugs, murderers who use a religious concept and masquerade and mask themselves in that religious construct. Overlooked is that many selfstyled jihadis are indeed psychopathic thugs, murderers some may not even believe in Allah at all. Yet this does not exonerate Islam, for its religious construct was designed to entice such men. As usual , this traces back to the prophet, Muhammad. After telling his followers that Allah had permitted Muslims four wives and limitless concubines Koran 43, he later claimed that Allah had delivered a new revelation Koran 33.51 permitting him, Muhammad alone, to marry and sleep with as many women as he wanted. In response, his young wife Aisha quipped I feel that your Lord hastens in fulfilling your wishes and desires. Apostates from Islam regularly cite this episode as especially disenchanting them with the prophet. But it is the concept of jihad that especially comports with those who seek to indulge their carnal appetites. For whoever fights in the name of Allah and/or seeks to empower Islamthat is, jihadis/terroristsis exonerated of all blame and, if he dies fighting, guaranteed the highest levels of paradise where more sex awaits. Thats because Allah made a pact with them. According to Koran 9111 Allah has bought from the believers their lives and worldly goods, and in return has promised them Paradise they shall fight in the way of Allah and shall slay and be slain. Rejoice then in the bargain you have struck, for that is the supreme triumph. Muhammad elaborated Lining up for battle in the path of Allah jihad to empower Islam is worthier than 60 years of worship. Moreover, The martyr is special to Allah. He is forgiven from the first drop of blood that he sheds. He sees his throne in paradise. He will wed the aynhour supernatural, celestial women designed exclusively for sexual purposes and will not know the torments of the grave and safeguards against the greater horror hell. Fixed atop his head will be a crown of honor, a ruby that is greater than the world and all it contains. And he will copulate with seventytwo aynhour. As for those Muslims who reject jihad, Muhammad said they will be tortured like no other sinful human. For many more Islamic scriptures depicting jihad as the greatest undertaking, one that earns unconditional forgiveness and paradise, see here . There is no denying that the historic growth of Islam is related to its carnal incentives. After more than a decade of preaching in Mecca, Muhammad had about 100 followers, mostly relatives. It was only when he became a successful warlord and caravan raider that his followers grew and multiplied. So long as such fighters helped spread the banner of Islam into infidel lands, they were deemed good and pious Muslimsregardless of their true intentions, priorities, or even faith. Many of the original jihadis now revered in Islamic hagiography were by modern standards little more than mass killing psychotics. Consider Khalid bin alWalid a Meccan pagan, he opposed Muhammad for years but when the prophet seized Mecca, Khalidlike many of Muhammads foes, such as his archenemy, Abu Sufyanexpediently converted, proclaimed the shahada , joined the winning team, and then went ajihadingmutilating, plundering, raping, enslaving, crucifying, and setting people on fire in the process. But because he did so under the banner of jihad, this serial killer and rapist is today one of Islams most revered heroes. The reason for this is that nowhere in Islam is there talk about the condition of the jihadis heart, or if hes right with God. Allah is not God he is not interested in hearts and minds but in fighters and swords. So long as his fighters proclaim the shahada There is no god but Allah and Muhammad is his messengerand fight under the banner of Islam, they can take, plunder, murder, and rape the infidels and if they die doing so, they go to paradise. Such was the genius of Muhammad in the Arabian society he lived in, members of ones tribe were as inviolable as nonmembers were free game, to be plundered, enslaved, or killed with impunity. Muhammad took this idea and infused it with a pious rationale. Henceforth there would be only two tribes in the world the umma which consists of all Muslims, regardless of raceand the infidels, who deserve to be plundered, enslaved, or killed with impunity for rejecting Allah. This explains why other tribal/nomadic societiesTurks and Mongols/Tatars, whose way of life consisted of preying on everyone outside their tribealso converted to Islam and, under the banner of jihad, continued preying on the other, the infidel, but now as venerated champions of the faith. Christian Europe was aware of Islams true appeal from the very beginning. Theophanes the Byzantine scholar d. 818 wrote the following about Muhammad in his chronicles He taught those who gave ear to him that the one slaying the enemyor being slain by the enemyentered into paradise see Koran 9111. And he said paradise was carnal and sensualorgies of eating, drinking, and women. Also, there was a river of wine  and the women were of another sort, and the duration of sex greatly prolonged and its pleasure longenduring e.g., Koran 56 740, 7831, 557077. And all sorts of other nonsense. Centuries later, St. Thomas Aquinas d. 1274 made similar observations He Muhamad seduced the people by promises of carnal pleasure to which the concupiscence of the flesh urges us. His teaching also contained precepts that were in conformity with his promises, and he gave free rein to carnal pleasure. In all this, as is not unexpected he was obeyed by carnal men. As for proofs of the truth of his doctrine. Muhammad said that he was sent in the power of his armswhich are signs not lacking even to robbers and tyrants. What is more, no wise men, men trained in things divine and human, believed in him from the beginning. Those who believed in him were brutal men and desert wanderers, utterly ignorant of all divine teaching, through whose numbers Mohammed forced others to become his followers by the violence of his arms. There is, finally, another group of Muslims who should not be overlooked. These do not give a fig for Allah nor wish to be martyred in exchange for paradise, but they rely on Islam to justify robbing, enslaving, raping, and killing nonMuslims, as many Christian minorities in nations like Pakistan and Egypt will attest. Because their victims are just infidelsand its a sin to aid a nonMuslim against a Muslim that is, a nontribal member against a tribal memberMuslim criminals target nonMuslim minorities precisely because they know Muslim authorities will not do a thing on behalf of the victimized infidels. In short, enough of these claims that this or that jihadi is, in the words of the CIAs Brennan, terrorists, criminals, psychopathic thugs, and murderers. Yes, they are. But that doesnt change the fact that one group of them is convinced that no matter how immoral or perverse their behavior is, as long as they continue fighting and dying in the name of jihad, paradise is assured them and another group doesnt care a bit about the afterlife, but knows that, as long as they only victimize infidels, no Muslim will hold them accountable. In both cases, Islam aids and abets their behavior.",hate
"The Muslim Bloc may have won the battle, but did Israel win the war October 28, 2016 Ari Lieberman By now it should be clear to all but the blindest or rabidly disingenuous that the United Nations is an organization that has been coopted by the nefarious interests of Muslim nations and their despotic third world allies. It is an organization rife with prejudice and hypocrisy. An organization that can undeniably and without equivocation be described as todays greatest purveyor of Judeophobia, historical revisionism and conspiracy theories. This fact is best illustrated by three resolutions passed this year by United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization UNESCO that deny the indisputable Jewish nexus to the holy city. On April 12, the 58member body voted in favor of an asinine and wholly onesided resolution that referred to Jewish holy sites in Jerusalem exclusively by their Muslim names and designated the Temple Mount, Judaisms holiest site, as a Muslim holy site of worship. To add insult to injury, the resolution also adopted wild conspiracy theories including a claim that Israel was planting Jewish fake graves in other spaces of the Muslim cemeteries. Unsurprisingly, the resolution, which was submitted by seven Muslim nations, passed by a wide margin with 33 votes in favor, six against and 17 abstentions. Two nations were absent for the vote. France, Sweden, Slovenia and Spain shamefully supported the vile resolution. That the resolution would pass was never in doubt given the large number of Muslim and despotic third world nations that constitute the makeup of UNESCO but it was hoped that the resolution would fail to garner European support and Israel could thus claim a moral victory. France with its collaborationist past and proclivity to kowtow to the worlds despots did not disappoint and predictably voted with the rabble. But following the vote, a crack appeared in the faade of antiIsrael invective so prevalent at the U.N. It appeared that France was having a case of buyers remorse. In an address to the French parliament, Prime Minister Manuel Valls termed the resolution clumsy and unfortunate. He then added in rather sharp and pointed terms that France will never deny the Jewish presence and Jewish history in Jerusalem. It would make no sense it is absurd to deny this history. France is one of Europes strongest advocates for the Palestinians. The Palestinian Authority and their Muslim allies at UNESCO should have understood from Valls statement that future resolutions with similar toxic content would no longer enjoy automatic European support. Instead of declaring victory and moving on, they pressed their luck by introducing another vile resolution in October. The October 13 resolution , sponsored by the usual suspects contained nearly identical language as the April resolution. It condemned Israel for various contrived transgressions and again severed the Jewish and Christian nexus to the city. This time however, the Muslim bloc was in for a rude awakening. While the resolution passed, the Muslim bloc was unable to garner a majority in the 58member body. Of the 24 nations that voted in favor of the resolution Mexico later withdrew support lowering the final tally to 23, 14 were composed of states with Muslim majorities while a fifteenth, Nigeria, is 50 percent Muslim, making passage of the resolution a forgone conclusion. What was notable was the fact that this time around, the resolution failed to garner a single western European concurrence. Other developing nations, like India, which had hitherto supported Arabsponsored drafts also abstained. Israels behindthescenes political offensive aimed at exposing the lunacy of the Muslim initiative was paying dividends. Following the resolutions passage, the Palestinians and their Muslim allies suffered additional political reversals. Mexico , asked for a revote because it wished to withdraw support for the motion. Mexicos Secretariat of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that his governments changed position reiterates the recognition that the Government of Mexico gives the undeniable link of the Jewish people to the cultural heritage of East Jerusalem. Brazil soon followed suit echoing Mexicos position. In a statement, the Brazilian government noted that it would no longer support such onesided resolutions. Italy, which had abstained, went one step further and announced that it would actively oppose such resolutions in the future. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi told an Italian radio station that these resolutions were incomprehensible, unacceptable and wrong. He added that to say that the Jews have no links to Jerusalem is like saying the sun creates darkness. Even UNESCOs directorgeneral, Irina Bokova voiced disapproval by stating that the heritage of Jerusalem is indivisible, and each of its communities has a right to the explicit recognition of their history and relationship with the city. She later received death threats for voicing objection to the motion. On Wednesday, the Palestinian Authority and Jordan introduced a third draft resolution to UNESCOs World Heritage Committee seeking to generate further political terrorism. The proposed resolution once again attempted to sever the Jewish nexus to the city and its holy sites. The 21member WHC body was expected to pass the resolution by consensus but in a surprise move, Croatia and Tanzania asked for a secret ballot which infuriated the Muslim bloc. Instead of the motion passing by consensus, the vote was 10 in favor, two opposed, eight abstentions and one nation absent. The two nations opposing were Tanzania and the Philippines. Of the 10 ayes, seven were Muslim. It was a pyrrhic victory at best. Given the large number of Muslim countries represented at the U.N. and the hostility that most of these nations harbor against Israel, it is a virtual certainty that toxic resolutions of this nature will continue to be sponsored and passed. But as evidenced by recent Arab political reversals, gone are the days that the Palestinians can rely on automatic European and nonaligned support. Israel has been effectively reaching out to the socalled nonaligned nations and it is having a significant positive impact. Part of the Israeli success lies in the fact that the Jewish state has much to offer these nations in the fields of water technology, agriculture, energy, counterterrorism, cyber warfare and arms. This outreach has translated to political dividends at the U.N. Nevertheless, the UNESCO resolutions serve to highlight the noxious nature and malevolence of many U.N. member states. It also underscores the need for the United States to maintain its commitment and assurance to Israel that it will never allow the U.N. to impose terms and dictates on Israel. There have been rumors circulating that Barack Obama in his twilight months would seek to impose a deleterious settlement on Israel utilizing the UN Security Council. The White House has remained uncharacteristically mute on the subject raising fears that there may be some merit to the speculation. The administrations objective would be accomplished by actively supporting a proposed antiIsrael resolution, likely introduced by France, or by choosing to abstain rather than exercising a veto. In addition to betraying longstanding commitments to Israel and running counter to strong bipartisan opposition, the notion that the United States would throw Israel under the bus and allow those who engage in despotism and blatant antiSemitism to have a say on Israels fate, is beyond asinine. Hopefully, the outrageous conduct exhibited at UNESCO steers the administration in the right direction.",hate
"Originally published by the Jerusalem Post . In one of the immortal lines of Godfather 2 , mafia boss Michael Corleone discusses the fate of his brother, who betrayed him, with his enforcer. I dont want anything to happen to him while my mother is alive, Corleone said. Message received. The brother was murdered after their mothers funeral. Last week it was reported that the Obama administration has delivered a message to the Palestinian Authority. The administration has warned the PA that the US will veto any antiIsrael resolution brought before the UN Security Council before the US presidential elections on November 8. Message received. Open season on Israel at the Security Council will commence November 9. The Palestinians are planning appropriately. Israel needs to plan, too. Israels most urgent diplomatic mission today is to develop and implement a strategy that will outflank President Barack Obama in his final eight weeks in power. Lobbying the administration is pointless. Obama has waited eight years to exact his revenge on Israel for not supporting his hostile, strategically irrational policies. And he has no interest in letting bygones be bygones. Before turning to what Israel must do, first we need to understand what Israel can do. A good place to begin is by considering what just transpired at UNESCO, where twice in a week, UNESCO bodies resolved to erase 3,000 years of Jewish history in Jerusalem and the Temple Mount. The fight that Israel waged at UNESCO is not the fight it needs to wage at the Security Council. The stakes at the Security Council are far higher. Like the UN General Assembly, UNESCOs decisions are nonbinding declarations that have no legal or operational significance. As such, there is no reason to expend great resources to fight them. For Israel, the goal of the fight at UNESCO is not to defeat antiIsrael initiatives. That is impossible given the Palestinians automatic majority. The purpose of the fight at UNESCO is to humiliate European governments that side with antisemitic initiatives, and to weaken the congenitally antiIsrael body itself. The government achieved both of these objectives. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzis disavowal of his own governments abstention from the vote on the first resolution  like the similar position taken after the fact by the Mexican government  was a diplomatic victory for Israel. So too, the fact that UNESCOs own SecretaryGeneral Irina Bukova felt compelled to disavow her own agencys actions by rejecting the resolutions denial of the Jewish peoples ties to Jerusalem was a significant victory for Israel. Her statement was deeply damaging for UNESCO and its reputation. Finally, the fact that Tanzania and the Philippines voted against the resolution was a testament to Israels capacity to convince other governments to abandon their traditional proPalestinian voting pattern. The Palestinians won the vote at UNESCO because they are more powerful diplomatically than Israel. They have an automatic antiIsrael majority. But they werent empowered by their victory. To the contrary. They were bloodied by it. In a sign of their weakening hold on member nations, the Palestinians and Jordanians felt compelled to send a threatening letter to the members of UNESCOs World Heritage Committee lest they dare to vote against the resolution. Powerful players dont make threats. They dont need to. Israels experience at UNESCO teaches us that there are governments that are open to counteroffers. Israel doesnt need to hide in Americas shadow. It is capable of working on its own to blunt the impact of the Palestinians automatic majority. And it will need to use all of its resources to fend off a USbacked assault at the Security Council. Unlike UNESCO, the Security Council can pass legally binding resolutions. Israel needs to be prepared to bring all of its resources to bear to prevent such a resolution from being adopted against it. Obamas intention to abandon Israel at the Security Council means that Israel comes to this battle severely hobbled. But there is one advantage to the USs betrayal. Over the years, Israels ability to trust the US to veto antiIsrael resolutions at the Security Council was been a mixed blessing. On the one hand, the US has secured Israel from diplomatic assaults. But on the other hand, our ability to trust Washington has made us diplomatically lazy and ineffective. Safe in Washingtons shadow, we have behaved as through all diplomacy is public diplomacy. That is, we have pretended that statecraft begins and ends with making the moral or strategic case for our side against the other guys. But public diplomacy is just one diplomatic tool. The Syrian regime, for instance, has no moral case for securing international support. Bashar Assad didnt convince Russian President Vladimir Putin to support him by arguing that he is better than alternative regimes. He bought Putins support by offering him permanent air and naval bases in Syria. Then there is Morocco, another weak state with no public diplomacy case to make. Last March, UN SecretaryGeneral Ban Kimoon outraged Rabat when he acknowledged the plain fact that Western Sahara, which Morocco occupies, is occupied territory. Morocco quickly secured the support of Spain and France and launched an allout onslaught against Ban. How did Morocco manage Moroccos most powerful diplomatic resource is its control over migration flows from North Africa to Europe. Anytime it wishes, Rabat can open the migratory floodgates just as easily as it can keep them shut. And the French and Spanish know it. In less than a month, Ban issued repeated abject apologies. Game. Set. Match. Morocco. From reports to date, it appears that shortly after the US elections on November 8, the Malaysians or Egyptians will submit a Palestinianbacked resolution that defines Israeli communities in united Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria as illegal. If the resolution is brought to a vote, the US will fail to veto it. Such a resolution, or a resolution obligating Israel to withdraw to the 1949 armistice lines, would cause Israel grave harm. So what resources does Israel have to prevent this from happening Of course, we have public diplomacy. And that might work with some friendly nations. But it wont get us over the top. We need to learn from the Syrian and Moroccan examples and consider what we have to offer Security Council members in exchange for their support in scuttling the approaching onslaught against us. One such resource is the US Congress. Israels allies in Congress are sickened by the Obama administrations devastating Middle East policies. A solid majority of lawmakers can be trusted to support actions that will reinforce Israels position. Israel has other resources as well that we can trade on. We have natural gas. And we have technologies that the governments of the world require to surmount the challenges of the 21 century. There is no reason to give these resources away when we can trade them for diplomatic support. As for the Palestinians, as the UNESCO vote showed, they are less popular now than at any time in the past 40 years. All they have to offer is threats and antisemitism. Both are powerful weapons. But they are no longer invincible. Israels goal must be to use our resources at the Security Council in a manner that will make it impossible for Obama to enable an antiIsrael resolution to pass. A method for achieving this goal has two components. The first component is to convince a friendly country on the Security Council to propose a balanced resolution that would counter the Palestinianbacked Israelbashing one. Such a resolution could include four points. First, it could deplore efforts to deny Jewish history in Jerusalem and the Temple Mount. Second, it can condemn the PA/PLO for their continued unlawful funding of terrorists. Third, it can urge Israel to restrain settlement construction in areas that in previous negotiations have been identified as likely territory for a future Palestinian state. Fourth, it can call on Israel and the PA to reinstate negotiations immediately without preconditions. Israel has friendly ties with a few Security Council members, among them Uruguay and New Zealand. In the final weeks of the Obama era, it is possible that Israel will be able to convince one of them to submit a balanced resolution along these lines. Obama would be hardpressed to oppose such a resolution in favor of one that singles Israel out for rebuke. But that still is insufficient. Obama can make Uruguay and New Zealand a better offer if he wishes. And so we move to the second aspect of the plan. If we learn nothing else from the Obama era, we must recognize that the time has come for Israel to stop sufficing with just one Security Council veto. Most states have several. And we need a few more. Russia today is the best place to start our search for a second veto. Putin is a dealmaker. As his agreement with Assad showed, he is willing to consider attractive offers. Obviously, Israel wont offer Russia bases. But we do have other things to offer Putin in exchange for a veto. For instance, in exchange for a Russian veto at the Security Council, Israel can offer Putin to lobby the US Congress to cancel US sanctions against Russia over Russias annexation of Crimea. Israel has no dog in that fight. And the sanctions are not getting the US anywhere. Putin might go for the deal for two reasons. First, by stepping into the breach and defending Israel against Obama, he will humiliate Obama. Second, if Israel succeeds with the Congress, he will reap economic rewards. For his part, Putin wouldnt even have to openly side with Israel. All he would have to do is announce that in the interests of regional stability, Russia will not support an unbalanced resolution on Israel and the Palestinians. If Putin supports a balanced resolution, Obama will be checkmated. His plan to take revenge on Israel for not following him off the strategic cliff will be foiled. Israel will have survived his presidency. None of this will be easy. And success is far from assured. There are many more ways for Israel to fail than succeed. Our diplomatic weakness remains a millstone around our neck. But as the UNESCO resolutions showed, attacking Israel is no longer cost free. We are not powerless in the grip of circumstances. We have cards to play. And now is the time to play them for all they are worth.",hate
"A look at the universitys new mission. October 28, 2016 Jack Kerwick Jonathan Haidt, a professor of social psychology at New York University, argued in a recently published essay that while its traditional telos end or goal has been truth, within the last few decades the university has assumed another Social Justice. The university, however, can only have one telos. The conflict between these two goals has raged for decades, Haidt claims. Last year, though, it became unmanageable when student groups at 86 universities and colleges around the country issued  demands  to administrators, demands for Social Justice that, by and large, were met. The following statement is posted at BlackLiberationCollective.org  We demand at the minimum, Black students and Black faculty to be reflected by the national percentage of Black folk in the state and the country. We demand free intuition for Black and indigenous students. We demand a divestment from prisons and an investment in communities. A statement of principles follows. The Black Liberation Collective BLC opposes antiBlackness sexism ableism capitalism White privilege inequality and heteronormativity. It rejects as well nonviolence considered as a principle in contradistinction to a tactic . AntiBlack racism is woven in the fabric of our global society, says the BLC. When social systems are racialized by white supremacy, whiteness becomes the default of humanity and Blackness is stripped of its humanity, becoming a commodity, becoming disposable. The BLC is antisexist insofar as it affirms the value of all Black womens lives whether cisgender, transgender, or genderqueer. In addition to rejecting Eurocentric beauty standards that are made to lessen the beauty of Black women and Black womens features, being antisexist also means realizing that police brutality, the prison industrial system, school to prison pipeline and the like are aspects of structural racism that affect black women as much as they impact black men. Black liberation entails queer liberation and trans liberation. We also seek to destroy the heteronormative norms that dehumanize Black queer people, the BLC asserts. The homophobia within the Black community comes by way of the same hands responsible for white supremacy. Presumably, transphobia within the black community is also a legacy of white supremacy. In cooperation with cissexism and the gender binary, transphobia has been used as a means of invalidating and erasing our trans family members. The BLC pledges to eliminate such systemic biases. These Social Justice Warriors SJWs are staunch opponents of the capitalist notions of infinite profit, homogenized markets, and a privatized means of production. Capitalism, they insist, is the economic system thats been used to justify the oppression, marginalization, and exploitation of blacks. Nor is the solution to this oppression to be found in supporting blackowned businesses. The BLC explains that we cannot adopt the patriarchal, exploitative tools of our oppressors as we seek liberation. Rather, the solution is to dismantle antiBlack capitalist corporations that benefit from our oppression. It isnt only the capitalist corporations that these students want destroyed. They demand as well the eradication of all institutional practices and policies that discriminate against the black community and the removal of all federal, state, and local government officials who do not abide by our principles. The State and all its institutions that deny Black humanity and Black agency must be dismantled and replaced with those that produce Black liberty. Concerning its attitude toward America, the BLC is clear This country was built to systematically oppress groups of people, and the Black Liberation Collective will not stand for it. Haidt misspeaks in characterizing 2015 as the year when the university experienced a crisis of identity, an unmanageable conflict of goals. To judge from the vast majority of liberal arts, humanities, and social sciences departments, Social Justice long ago eclipsed truth as the raison detre of the academy. Interestingly, it is these SJW demands from last year that bear this out. Perhaps it is because Ive spent the last couple of decades in the academy in the capacity of both student and faculty that I may be more privy to this than are some others, but its painfully obvious that these student activists did not come up with these demands on their own. If they didnt have their professors actually write the demands for them, then the Black Liberation Collective unquestionably derived the concepts and language of their statement of demands from their mentors. To put it bluntly, one must attend college, major in the liberal arts and humanities, and study under far left professors in order to think in the terms that are characteristic of Social Justice Warriors. Leftist ideologues are training their students to bend the university to their will. This is the first point. There is, though, another, a rich irony that is lost upon these selfstyled radicals. For all of their bluster over systemic racism and structural white supremacy, i.e. phenomena that are omnipresent and, hence, largely unconscious, these black students, their white collaborators, and their professors fail to realize that their thinking for lack of a better term on these issues is about as Eurocentric as one can get. The  critical race theory  to which the BLC subscribe is a version of Marxism, the philosophical vision of a 19 th century GermanJewish man. The Marxist tradition within which they are enmeshed was fleshed out over a span of generations by mostly white heterosexual men. But theres more to it than this. The idea that racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, and the like against which SJWs rail are evils to be defeated is itself peculiar to the moral traditions of European civilization. If these isms and phobias are immoral it can only be because those who are guilty of them fail to judge the individual as an individual. Color, gender, sexual orientation, ability, and so forth are neither constitutive of nor essential to the moral identity of the individualbut only if the framework of the doctrine of individualism is accepted. Yet this conception of the sacrosanct individual is as Eurocentric as the proverbial apple pie is American. The Social Justice Warriors intellectual landscape is as much a European colony as was any West African country in the 19 th or early 20 th centuries. Those in the Black Liberation Collective have most definitely internalized the modes of thought of their oppressor. Now, they would have been well aware of all this had they received a genuine education in college rather than a training in Social Justice.",hate
"What feminists can learn from Melania Trump. October 28, 2016 Ilana Mercer In recent interviews, Donald Trumps wife, Melania Trump, observed wryly that almost every malicious, liefilled article about herself or he husband was written by a  female. Indeed, women seem to have a particular stake in bringing Mr. Trump down. The contrast between Mrs. Trump and the many histrionic shrews prosecuting her husband is stark. In both her interviews with CNNs condescending Anderson Cooper and Fox Newss Ainsley Earhardt, Mrs. Trump was the embodiment of strength. When a liberal woman declares shes a strong woman usually uttered in a tartlike, staccato inflection, shes using a clich. Look at her actions. Youll see that strong to liberal distaff means kicking and screaming until she brings others into compliance with her worldview and ways. A strong liberal woman is one who hammers you about your obligation to forkout for her Trojans and her Trivora. And if birth control fails our liberated libertine, then youre on the hook for her abortions and abortifacients. And dont dare doubt any of the intemperate charges leveled by this prototype liberal succubus against a man, any man. To doubt her is to harm her. It was not without significance that Hillary Clintons first general election speech, in June, was before Planned Parenthood. At the time, media buried the story of one named Rajiv K. Fernando , who had donated to the Clinton Foundation and was given a seat as Hillarys nuclear weapons advisor. Watching this, I was thinking endemic corruption, the 19 trillion debt, the dire jobs report, the terrifying prospect of negative interest rates and the fate of savers. But Hillary and her gynobrigade in media and across the country were cheering for a universal right to taxpayerpaid dilation and curettage DC. Melania Trump, on the other hand, is authentically strong. In her refusal to impart salacious tellall tidbits to interviewers, in the way she guards her privacy and that of her family in her serene, gracious, and beautiful manners and bearingMrs. Trump exemplifies a European womans good breeding. Shes a class act. Her enemies are the cultural underclass. Nor does Mrs. Trump display any of the histrionics about men exhibited by her American counterparts. There are images on the Internet of presidents being inappropriate with women. In particular, you can watch a grainy YouTube clip of Barack Obama appearing to be showing off his crotch to giggling female reporters. In another, the president, with Frances Nicolas Sarkozy, is eying the shapely behind of a young woman passing by. Much to media chagrin, Melania refused to get worked up about the 2005 Access Hollywood tape in which her husband engaged in lockerroom talk. Men will be men. If theyre not saying it theyre thinking it. More material than her mien were Melania Trumps words of reason. On the Sovietstyle witchhunt launched against her husband with media mediation, she said this All sexual assault allegations should be handled in a court of law. To accuse someone, man or woman, without evidence is damaging and unfair. This was the exact verdict of famed defense attorney Tom Mesereau, about the Bill Cosby pileon. Quit the feeding frenzy. Give the man his due process. Investigate the women, counseled Mesereau, Esq., at the time. The very embodiment of the malevolent liberal matriarchy rising is the sainted Michelle Obama. The First Lady was lauded for an unhinged antiTrump address to the nations women. In a world where Americans have been beheaded on camera, women raped en masse on Europes streets, and Christians exterminated in the Middle Eastthe First Lady bewailed being shaken to her shallow core by raunchy words. I cant stop thinking about it, groaned Michelle about Mr. Trumps Access Hollywood indiscretion. It has shaken me to my core in a way I could not have predicted. The ritualistic decapitation on the altar of a Catholic priest by Muslim migrants in France Thats something I cant stop thinking about. The machinegunning of five Macys shoppers and employees by a Turkish Muslim immigrant Arcan Cetin, in my neck of the woods That has shaken me to my core in a way I could not have predicted. Again, Mrs. Obamas pitiful case against Mr. Trump has strengthened nothing but her dramaqueen credentials. Candidate Clinton crowed that Mrs. Obamas long whinge for women was a compelling and strong case about the stakes in the election, about who we are as Americans. Indeed, the implicit case Michelle put to women is this a mammoth national debt, a shrinking job market, rising lawlessness and racial strife, an annual intake of mostly ThirdWorld immigrants exceeding 3 million, the dangers to life and limb of importing more Islam fuhgeddaboudit. What counts, whimpered Michelle Obama, voice tremblingyes, Mrs. Obama almost brought herself to tearswas to ferret out microaggression, and find a safeplace to hunker down. As I write, Sen. Elizabeth Warren has stormed a stage somewhere for Hillary Clinton. Phony Pocahontas is hollering about the power of nasty women to immiserate. Clinton and Warren make for a resentful, domineering, powerhungry pair, whove made it big in life through the use of state power. The human backdrop to their displays of female force invariably looks the same. Whereas Trump rallies are packed with hopefilled, beaming faces a ClintonWarren affair is festooned with malevolentlooking, aggrieved women and their frightened, lowT houseboys. The background music enfeebled squeaking courtesy of a female pop singer like Katy Perry, whose outoftune yelps and bedroom whispers would be unheard, if not for the marvel of AutoTune. AutoTune is the holy grail of recording that corrects intonation problems in vocals or solo instruments, in real time, without distortion or artifacts. It was invented by a male engineer. Shudder. If this melodramatic, neurotic message is the voice of Americas womenand legions of Republican women have seconded itthen count me with HER, with Melania.",hate
"Search Zineb el Rhazoui, Charlie Hebdo Survivor, Discusses Why the World Needs to Destroy Islamic Fascism Undeterred by fatwas and death threats, the author has released an incendiary and thoughtful new book, bound to provoke debate. October 28, 2016 Reprinted from NyTimes.com. She leads a clandestine existence, on the move and under 24hour guard as Frances most protected woman. Yet Zineb El Rhazoui, the Charlie Hebdo journalist who happened to be in Casablanca on January 7 last year, the day terrorists avenging the Prophet massacred nine people at the satirical magazine in Paris, believes she has a duty to defy Islamists desperate to silence her. Shaken but undeterred by the fatwas and relentless, precise death threats issued via social media to kill the bitch since she helped produce the publications first survivors issue following the attack  and spoke about it in Arabic for the Arab press  the MoroccanFrench writer refuses to assume an anonymous identity. Fleeing Paris or abandoning her human rights activism, and her unforgiving critiques of the religion she grew up with, are also out of the question. I dont have the right to renounce my struggle, or to give up my freedom, says the reporter and sociologist of religion in an interview with Women in the World, during a recent trip to New York, as part of French president Francois Hollandes delegation when he received the Appeal of Conscience Foundations World Statesman Award for 2016. If the French state protects me it is not little individual me What is being protected is my freedom to be irreverent, and freedom of expression, so I should exercise this even more because I enjoy this protection. Its totally crazy. I have done nothing against the law and have nothing to hide, yet I live with security while those who threaten us are free, El Rhazoui declares with an air of shock and anger that underscores the arbitrariness and brutality visited on a 34yearold woman condemned to living on the run and mostly in the shadows. And if you call them by their names you are Islamophobic and racist. I am racist I can teach them a few things about Arab culture. I can show them how to discover its richness and the diversity of their culture. I believe this culture deserves universality because you can be Arab, Muslim and a free thinker. Resisting terror Sweeping in to the offices of Women in the World in Manhattan, accompanied by bodyguards, the worldrenowned journalist is living proof of her pledge to keep living her life beyond its limits as a key way of resisting terror. Elegant and beautiful, with her long, wavy hair flowing freely and in an impeccably tailored black dress, El Rhazoui is reminiscent of 1940s cinemas cerebral heroines  her eloquence and composure only occasionally betraying the trauma of the past 20 months. Each time we speak about the aftermath of the massacre at her magazine and how she is coping personally her voice quavers, but when the subject comes back to her fight for reform in Islamic civilization she is fearless. In this spirit, El Rhazoui, obliged to spend most of her time in hiding, like Salman Rushdie after his 1989 publication of The Satanic Verses , has taken the highrisk option of publishing an explosive new book about Islam. Detruire Le Fascisme Islamique  Destroy Islamic Fascism , being released in France this week, takes the battle of ideas directly to the ideologicallydriven zealots who inspired the assassins of her dear friend Charb Stephane Charbonnier, late editor of Charlie Hebdo who preferred to die standing than to live on my knees. Obtained exclusively by Women in the World, the book dedicated to Muslim atheists is an unapologetic strike against the strict application of Islam by imitating the first Salafists or pious ancestors. The Prophet Mohammed and his companions, whose violent exploits are contained in bellicose texts from a barbaric 7thcentury Bedouin tribal context, exhibited codes of behavior El Rhazoui insists have no place in the modern world and can be directly connected to terrorism. The most abject crimes of Islamic State are but a 21stcentury remake of what the first Muslims accomplished under the guidance of the Prophet, she writes, noting that sexual and domestic slavery, the massacre of nonMuslims notably Jews, pedophilia, pillage, polygamy and summary executions were all adopted from preIslamic societies. The book is also the journalists way of carrying on the legacy of her dead comrades, who reveled in their right to mock established religion and fanatics everywhere  with Islam no exception to their traditional French anticlerical ridicule  through satire and caricature. Formerly the magazines religion writer, El Rhazoui is in the throes of joining the exodus of staff breaking from the magazine under its new management. Flush with cash from international donations, the fundamentally altered publication, she disappointedly explained,  will probably never again draw the Prophet  out of fear of more reprisals. And those who think that only a handful of madmen are capable of killing for a cartoon of Mohammed forget that everywhere that Islam reigns as the religion of the state, caricatures and cartoons in the press are repressed. El Rhazouis book, dedicated to Muslim atheists, is an unapologetic strike against the strict application of Islam. Religion of peace and love We need to admit that Islamism today is applied Islam, El Rhazoui  who describes herself as an atheist of Muslim culture writes, responding to politicians, religious figures, Islamophobia opponents and media commentators who claim after every jihadist attack that real Islam has nothing to do with such terror. When we apply Islam to the letter it gives Islamism, and when we apply Islamism to the letter it gives terrorism. So we need to stop saying Islam is a religion of peace and love. What is a moderate Islamist An Islamist who doesnt kill The essaylength book is in the grand French polemical tradition of Emile Zola whose Jaccuse denounced the antiSemitism of the French state and establishment during the Dreyfus Affair, on the eve of the 20th century. El Rhazoui, who holds Moroccan and French citizenship, takes aim at a very 21stcentury phenomenon what she abhors as the intellectual fraud of Islamophobia, which pretends to be about antiracism but in her reckoning is used as a weapon to silence all critics of Islam and the ideas behind it as automatically hostile towards all Muslims. Epitomized by the French Collective Against Islamophobia CCIF, this deliberate strategy vilifies as Islamophobic voices such as El Rhazouis who dare question the religion the CCIF and fellow travelers define only through the prism of their own fundamentalism. The notion of Islamophobia doesnt even exist in Muslim countries, the author points out, because outside the West, criticism of the religion or Mohammed is officially categorized as blasphemy. Unable to pass blasphemy laws in Europe, groups like the CCIF employ a dangerous semantic confusion, she said. On the CCIF site it is written Islamophobia is not an opinion it is an offense. This is very dangerous because it has even entered the dictionary as hostility towards Islam and Muslims. Yet criticism of an idea, of Islam or of a religion cannot be characterized as an offense or a crime. I was born and lived under the Islam of Morocco and live in France and I have the right criticize religion and this dictatorship of Islamophobia that says I have no right to criticize If we criticize Christianity it doesnt mean we are Christianophobes or racist towards the Christian race. The widespread pressure to selfcensor is severe, El Rhazoui says. You can no longer speak about Islam without saying its a religion of peace and love. But when you open any book in Islam what do you find Violence, blood, oppression of women and hate for other religions. Of course you can find this in other religions, however we are talking about something written many centuries ago during a barbaric time for humanity. As long as we dont talk about this, and keep repeating that Islam is a religion of peace and love, many people will continue to believe the Koran is a constitution, and that rather than being a book written 15 centuries ago reflecting a particular context, it is a legal constitution to apply today. Zineb El Rhazoui feels she is carrying on the legacy of her dead Charlie Hebdo comrades. After completing high school in Morocco, El Rhazoui studied languages and the sociology of religion, obtaining a Masters degree from Pariss prestigious social science graduate school EHESS. In her twenties she returned to the country of her birth to work as a journalist at Le Journal Hebdomadaire, becoming a campaigner for secular liberties, such as the right to break the fast and even snack in public during the month of Ramadan. This act of nonviolent resistance earned her her first fatwa, ahead of her involvement in the movement supporting the Arab Spring in 2011. The wave of personal attacks and threats that came after her collective protest against Ramadan rules prompted her to leave Morocco again for France where she began to report for Charlie Hebdo, bringing her memories of having vomited up compulsory religious classes in a country where being Muslim is not a choice unless youre Jewish or Christian. Extreme personality cult Socalled Islamic fascism, seen in its most extreme form in groups like ISIS, shares characteristics in common with all extremeright fascisms, El Rhazoui argues, because it combines an intense personality cult around Mohammed as the incarnation of the nation. It also employs widespread systems of suspicion and denunciation, exemplified by sartorial branding  for example Burkinis or niqabs  that allow for immediate identification and targeting of nonadherents. There are also familiar fascist tropes of repressive sexism against women and homosexuals, armed militias, adoption of a flag, and a strategy that confers the benign status of Muslim women to heavily veiled adherents in the West, and characterizes them, disingenuously, as victimized objects of exclusion. The literary corpus of Islam is so stuffed with damning accounts it would be difficult to cleanse it without altering the fundamentals of dogma, El Rhazoui writes. If the terrorists of Daesh ISIS behead those they judge to be miscreants, that is because they draw on their legislation in the texts like the 8th surah of the Koran, alAnfal, verse 12 Remember what Your Lord revealed to the angels  I am with you, so support those who have believed. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. You can strike them above the neck and strike off every fingertip. You can be Arab, Muslim and a free thinker Drawing on her personal experience and scholarly knowledge of Islams core Arabic texts, the politics of the postArab Spring Middle East, and the wellspring of reformism and dissidence embraced within the multifaceted Islamic civilization, El Rhazouis book is an impassioned response to all the extremists who want to see her and her fellow opponents of politicoreligious repression dead. The greatest racism is, El Rhazoui argues, the racism of the Islamist ideology that forbids marriage with people who are not Muslims, and that rejects women. That is the definition of racism and fascism and we must say it, the writer adds. Today Islam in the world only has a role as a civilization. A civilization is defined by many things and not uniquely by religion  but also by its geographical heritage, its artistic, culinary and sartorial traditions and by literature. The Muslim religion has its place in the modern world if it submits itself fully to the laws that rule humanity today universal principles of equality between men and women, sexual and individual freedom, and equality for all, no matter your creed or religion. Until Islam has admitted this and accepted that the freedom of men and women is superior to it, Islam will not be acceptable. Islamophobia whiners Destroy Islamic Fascism aims to puncture the hypocrisy and fauxintellectual fakery the authors word of Islamophobia whiners and other collaborationists from across the political spectrum  particularly the hard left, CryptoIslamist antiracists on a quest for a new Muslim proletariat, certain feminists, cultural relativists and socalled moderate Imams. All these willing accomplices do is distort the noble cause of fighting racism to give undeserved legitimacy to an ideology that at its most extreme results in the horrors of Islamic State, the author says, but also makes the lives of millions of Muslims living in Islamic countries downright miserable. What do these Islamophobia whiners say to the millions of individuals who live in Islamic theocracies and dream of liberty El Rhazoui concludes in her book. Who speaks about the nightmare of a woman who decides to cross the streets of Algiers, Casablanca or Cairo in a skirt those who would like to drink a glass of alcohol in countries where you have to flout the law to do it  about homosexuals, pariahs of Muslim societies, who often only have the choice of death, prison or exile Who speaks about this youth born Muslim but dreaming of a normal life, these teens attacked for having had a romance The summer furore over Burkini bans in France agitated the author who deplored the cynical rush of Islamists and their Western sympathizers in the media, academia and politics to celebrate the controversial swimsuit as a form of liberation and simultaneously a banal piece of cloth preferred by Muslim women, even though most never wear it. Western media, in an intolerable readiness to oblige, have defended the Burkini as a freedom and a legitimate cultural expression of a part of humanity, she said, but pointed out that in Muslim countries the beaches are not filling up with Burkinis, but they are emptying themselves of women. From one year to another, they are disappearing from the public space, because the veil has never been anything except an extension of the walls of their harem to the exterior. As for mainstream or moderate Muslim clerics, El Rhazoui tells Women in the World that during the Burkini debate in France not one Imam stood up and said Hey, wait a minute, you can be Muslim and wear a regular bathing suit. History will judge those who have monopolized the debate, given a platform to Islamist fundamentalism and even given it a guarantee of acceptability, the author of Destroy Islamic Fascism told Women in the World. This is just betrayal and it is collaboration with one of the worst forms of fascism that exists today, she said. According to the writer, who is repeatedly accused of bigotry, the Islamophobia ruse is driven by great ignorance and a lack of understanding of the culture of Islam and what Islam with a big I is  they ignore its complexity and that there have always been opposition currents and progressive and liberal pushes from within. The accomplices dont recognize the struggles playing out today in Arab countries will inevitably be won by the democrats and free people. No fascism or totalitarianism has ever been able to win in the long haul of history. The people who are the allies and collaborators of this totalitarianism today will be judged by history and seen as accomplices to this criminal ideology to which they have given a veneer of respectability. For El Rhazoui the true racism emerges from a condescending approach to Islamic culture that decrees an Islamic woman in a burqa is congenitally not free and that her race is the burqa. We present the fundamentalists as being a race and this only shows the contempt we have for this culture. It is absolutely intolerable, she says. Survivor syndrome Women in the World asked El Rhazoui how she manages to keep up her spirits, and continue her struggle for the freedom to dissent after everything that has happened since January 2015. It is a question people often ask me, she said with a perceptible tremor in her voice. But when you live through these moments in which you are confronted by a reality as cruel and simple as life and death, you realize can put many things in perspective. Straight after the attacks, like many of my colleagues I felt guilty for having stayed alive. I said to myself Those who are dead are dead for all our work, and some are dead when it wasnt even their work. But it was my work because I am a journalist and I am still here. And then you understand this is all part of survivor syndrome, which is normal when you survive a massacre like that. As you start to heal you say, I am lucky to be alive and if I am still here perhaps that is because I still have something to do. I understood long before the attack on Charlie, when I engaged in a struggle for individual liberties and democracy in Morocco, that when you fight against totalitarianism, whether it is political or religious, you should never give your enemies the pleasure of stopping living. We fight so that everyone can have a free and happy life and we must continue to live this same life. Zineb El Rhazoui C attends the funeral of French cartoonist and Charlie Hebdo editor Stephane Charb Charbonnier, on January 16, 2015 in Pontoise, outside Paris. MARTIN BUREAU/AFP/Getty Images Still a day doesnt go past when she doesnt think of her old colleague Charb and their many heated discussions. He was someone who was extremely lucid and for whom the concepts were clear. He was a true humanist who didnt fear being accused of being racist because for him it was absurd. El Rhazouis deconstruction of Islam is also a defense of Muslims, she reasoned, as salvation will come when we stop aligning the identity of an entire community with the most fundamentalist people who pretend to represent it. We have to extend a hand to all these Muslims who are free people, who have questioned their heritage, and who are fighters for liberty, battling for the same values as us but in a context controlled by Islamists, she says. Life in a moving jail Since January 2015, the survivor from Charlie Hebdo has traveled frequently to speak at universities and meetings of the Freedom Forum, in Europe and the U.S., under the protection assured by the French state and the countries that receive her. She says she would never complain about living under permanent armed guard and having her freedom of mobility curtailed, because so many other writers and political figures around the world  and especially in Islamistcontrolled or influenced countries  are taking the brave decisions to do as she does but without any security. I always find some spaces of freedom. There are always little escape hatches. Life continues says the woman who has just written her second book since the Charlie attacks, and recently became a firsttime mother, in what she laughingly called the surprise baby boom at a publication that used to have one of the lowest birthrates in French media. Today I wander around in a moving jail  its a moving cage  but in reality I am more free in my head than those who threaten me. Because their cage is inside their head. They have this cage in their brain and even if they have freedom of movement it is their spirit and their reason and intelligence that is imprisoned. I am much freer than them.

"ProPalestinian Propaganda Lowering Standards of Truth in America Manipulation by doctored narratives in every sphere. October 28, 2016 Reprinted from IsraelNationalNews.com . Commendably, organized American Jewry is finally focused on the campaign to boycott, delegitimize, and sanction Israel. However, focusing primarily on Israel, and not also on America and Europe, is shortsighted. The BDS campaign has not devastated Israel economically. Israel is thriving both economically and in terms of regional alliancesbut fifty years of a wellfunded propaganda campaign has all but destroyed Israels good name and has rendered her and Jews everywhere vulnerable to diplomatic, academic, and mob attacks. It has also lowered the standards for truth among Americans. This is a very important point. An Islamicstyle of Jew hatred has merged with Western, politically correct antiracism to breed an unnatural passion for Palestinians, Fakestinians, which has infiltrated every corner, every crevice of our lives and world. It has infected Americans and Europeans on both sides of the aisle and of every class, race, and ethnicity. This is utterly astounding, amazing really something like this does not happen overnight. The BDS campaign is rooted in the Arab League, PLO, and Soviet propaganda campaign that began in the mid1960s. In the mid1970s, the UN proposed its infamous ZionismRacism resolution. In 1967, the day after Israel won yet another war of selfdefense, Israelnot the Arab aggressorswas seen as the alleged occupier. By the late 1970s, Edward Saids treacherous, lying work had begun to have its way with Western academics, and with Westernstyle academics in Israel, European governments, and international organizations. I only realized how successful his campaign was in 1980, when Israel was demonized at a UN conference on Women in Copenhagen. The Soviets, the Iranians, the Arab League, the PLO roamed the hallways chanting Death to Israel European feminists called upon Palestinian refugees but refused to hear JewishIsraeli refugees from Arab and Muslim countries. By 2001, the UN World Conference Against Racism in Durban was an even more outofcontrol Hate Fest and riot against Israel. As we approach 2017, UN Resolutions against Israel are as commonplace as they are grotesque. UNESCOs recent decision to DeJudaize Jerusalem, the Western Wall, and the First and Second Temples is a grim and maddening continuation of this trend. At the same time, proIsrael professors and students in America are increasingly being harassed, even fired. Such Lies have infiltrated my private social world. For example At a recent holiday dinner, our guests agreed that we live in criminal and anarchic times and that no great power has stopped global barbarism, no entity is willing to bring the world back from the brink. A likeminded gathering, yes Not exactly. One man, a genial, wellheeled, welleducated JewishAmerican suddenly began hectoring us about the Palestinians. What if they did not hate the Jews and destroyed all their textbooks that demonize Jews and Israelis What if they were peaceful Wouldnt we have to admit that Palestinians have always existed and therefore deserve a state of their own You cant deny that the Palestinian people have always lived there, can you Oh my. Where to start The company included two authorscholars who, between them, have published 15 books and thousands of articles, many of them dealing with the history and nature of Islam, tribal gender and religious apartheid, Israel, and antiSemitism, etc. Among us was a third author, who had also served four tours of duty in the IDF. I held my breath and prayed that we would not go to war at the table. This man was punching way above his pay grade and I could not understand why. The two authorscholars presented facts, cited statistics. I pulled down book after book from my shelves. We got nowhere. Look, he said. I have some really good Muslim friends, theyre Americans, totally Westernized, they are Palestinians. They strongly feel that this is their identity. Why deny them the identity of their choice And then I understood that the proPalestinian/antiZionist propaganda behind the relentless BDS campaign is successful precisely because so many Americans of all ages, are without knowledge without respect for knowledge do not know this and frankly, dont care. Fair is fair, he said. In other words Whats good for the Jews has to be good for everyone else. If not, the Jews dont deserve whatever it is either. Heres a man whos not an antiSemite or an antiZionist not an active member of any organizationyet who needs to believe the canard that nonJewish Palestinians have always existed or that they existed by the nineteenth century or no later than 1948, the year that another stateless peoplethe Jewschose a national sovereign identity. He would not listen to reason. It was quite astounding. How is this possible His mindset is part of our ruling American zeitgeist. If Rachel Dolezal can say shes black even when shes white and direct a chapter of the NAACP if a man can say that hes really a woman, trapped in a mans body if all truths are relative if everything is subjective if objectivity is no longer important if doctored narratives have supplanted factbased histories if revisionism is preferred to truththen, yes, anyone can say that they deserve their own nation state because they feel or believe that they do. I am grateful to my combative guest for reminding me that ignorance is often arrogant and as such, is a great enemy that educated people have been especially vulnerable to False Ideas that, psychologically speaking, we must approach them as if theyve been brainwashed by a cult. Facts alone will not work. We must consider all known techniques for deprogramming. This is one of our greatest challenges.",hate
"US Navy Iran Giving Terrorists Missiles to Fire at US Ships October 28, 2016 Theres only one possible solution. Lets load 400 million in unmarked foreign currency on an unmarked cargo plane and deliver it to Iran, Then make follow that up with a few more. And make sure Iran scores 150 billion in sanctions relief. Thats how we got here . Its SmartPower, which is neither smart nor powerful. Earlier this month US Navy ships had to fire defensive interceptor missiles after they were targeted by attacks launched from Houthicontrolled Yemen. This was likely the first time in history the Navy had to take such measures, and officials are now saying they think Iran is behind the attacks. We believe that Iran is connected to this, Vice Admiral Kevin Donegan told NBC News. In fact, the US has intercepted many shipments of weapons from Iran to the Houthi militants, who oppose Yemens internationally recognized government in a conflict that has seen thousands of civilian deaths and mass starvation of the civilian population. The intercepted shipments were filled with coastal defense cruise missiles, boats that we believe were explosive boats, other weapons that were clearly on the decks of their ships that we saw, Donegan said. Im sure theres no chance that the billions Obama lavished on Iranian jihadists have in any way freed up the terror state to open its own Jihadi candy store. Not a chance. And Im sure that when Iran gets the nuclear weapons that Obama is enabling, it will use them as responsibly as its using its cruise missiles.",hate
"Hillary Clinton Seeks Even More Unfit Secretary of State Than Her October 28, 2016 Daniel Greenfield Having never read any medieval German folk tales, Hillary Clinton is counting her chickens before theyve hatched and preparing to hand out jobs that no one has handed her to hand out. Shes busy planning her fantasy cabinet for her fantasy administration. And her big pick makes sense. Reportedly she would like to make Joe Biden the Secretary of State. Biden is the obvious choice. Hes arrogant, dumb and brimming with bright ideas like just giving Iran money or splitting Iraq into little pieces. Obviously this wouldnt be a competency pick. The last time we had someone qualified as Secretary of State was during President Bushs time in office. Then Democrats decided they would give the job as a consolation prize to failed presidential candidates. Because our foreign policy is just that important. And who could be counted on to make an even bigger mess than Hillary Clinton or John Kerry... Joe Biden. Its a perfect plan. If you want a fall guy to blame everything on, they dont come any more obvious than Joe Biden. And if you want someone shadowed by the soft bigotry of low expectations, youve gotta go Joe.

"The Bundy Verdict is Another Defeat for Obama October 28, 2016 Daniel Greenfield Obama Inc. has a lot more luck with the media than it does with trials. Its lynchings of police officers have not gotten very far. Baltimore was the biggest and most resounding defeat. But it wasnt the only one. And the vastly differing treatment of the Bundy protesters and the Dakota pipeline protesters, from killing to government backing, have not had their intended effect. Instead Obama lost at trial. Again. This time its the Bundy case. That was when the left realized it hated civil disobedience, just before rediscovering it again when it came to environmental protests. But big gov lost this one . Again. A jury Thursday delivered a stunning acrosstheboard acquittal to the leaders and participants in the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge occupation and a remarkable blow to the federal government as it tries to tamp down a national movement led by a Nevada family to open public lands to ranchers, miners and loggers. The verdicts finding Ammon Bundy, older brother Ryan Bundy and five others not guilty of a federal conspiracy drew elation from defense attorneys who spent five weeks arguing that the armed takeover amounted to a timehonored tradition of First Amendment protest and civil disobedience. The highprofile case riveted the state and drew national and international attention to the isolated bird sanctuary in rural eastern Oregon. The jurys decision proved no less dramatic and sets up a showdown in the next stage of the landrights movement. It means that Big Green Gov will have to think twice next time around. Or do a much better job of picking a jury. The Oregon prosecutors sat silently in front of their boss, U.S Attorney Billy Williams, and the head of the FBI in Oregon, Greg Bretzing, as the judge announced the not guilty pleas one by one. But it was quickly back to more of the same. ut the trial fireworks werent quite over. A brawl broke out at the very end, when six to seven U.S. marshals surrounded Ammon Bundys lawyer as he stood before the judge, arguing and shouting for his client to walk out the door a free man. They tackled him and stunned him with a Taser gun. As Mumford yelled, What are you doing, U.S. District Judge Anna J. Brown ordered, Everybody out of the courtroom All I was asking for was papers, Mumford said after emerging from federal custody nearly two hours later.

"Hillarys Secretary of State After 9/11 Send a Check for 200 Million to Iran   Were talking about Tehran Joe Biden of course who is good pals with the Iran Lobby. Biden is reportedly Hillarys fantasy cabinet pick for Secretary of State. Because the Democrats have decided that Secretary of State is a job too important to be trusted to experienced diplomats, but should instead be reserved strictly as a consolation prize for failed presidential candidates. Heres a flashback on Bidens views . Democratic vicepresidential candidate Joe Biden was quoted Monday as telling senior Israeli officials behind closed doors that the Jewish state will have to reconcile itself to a nuclear Iran. In the unsourced report, Army Radio also quoted Biden as saying that he opposed opening a additional military and diplomatic front. Army Radio said Israeli officials expressed amazement over the remarks attributed to him. Israel will have to reconcile itself with the nuclearization of Iran, Army Radio quoted Biden as telling the unnamed officials. Bidens people loudly denied the report, but he had a history of being tight w ith the Iran Lobby. Some might call it reaching out to American Muslims. But to many Iranians living in California, a fundraiser for Sen. Joseph Biden DDel. at the home of a prominent proIran lobbyist on Feb. 19 sent a wrongheaded message to the ruling clerics in Tehran. When we learned that Sen. Biden was planning to hold a fundraiser at the California home of Dr. Sadegh Namazikhah, we immediately contacted his office to express our dismay, a prominent IranianAmerican activist tells Insight. Why dismay Dr. Namazikhah is wellknown in the Los Angeles area for his support of the ruling clerical regime in Tehran and is one of the regimes leading unofficial lobbyists in America. We thought that Sen. Biden might not know his background. Getting the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to appear at this event will certainly be seen by the regime in Tehran as a show of support. On the eve of the fundraiser, which brought an estimated 30,000 into Bidens reelection coffers, a Biden staffer told the activist that the senators staff had all the facts necessary to make a decision, and he was planning to attend the fundraiser despite the protests. Several participants who paid to attend the event tell Insight that Biden arrived at 8 p.m., stayed until 11 and delivered a sweeping condemnation of President George W. Bushs Axis of Evil formula. As Senator, Biden was not only undermining Bush, but fundraising off it at the home of supporters of a terrorist enemy state. Biden also impressed many of those present with his friendly attitude toward the Islamic Republic of Iran. The senator said that Iran always wanted to be an ally of the United States and to have good relations with the U.S., according to Housang Dadgostar, a prominent lawyer. As IranianAmericans, we dont want anything to happen to the Iranian government or to the Iranian people as a result of this war on terrorism, says Mohsen Movaghar, a Los Angeles businessman. Both men belong to the 70member board of directors of Namazikhahs Iranian Muslim Association of North America IMAN. Namazikhah denied any official contact with the Iranian government. But he tells Insight that he regularly travels to Iran  something many expatriates do  and that he actively supports moderates within the ruling clergy, such as Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, in their efforts to bring reform to the Islamic system. Namazikhah and other IMAN board members say Bidens office contacted them to inquire if they would hold a private fundraiser for the senator, who is up for reelection this year, after meeting with them at a proTehran gala in New York last December. That event was sponsored by the AmericanIranian Council AIC, a proregime lobbying group trying to get Congress and the Bush administration to lift the trade embargo on Iran. But Biden had the perfect post 9/11 reaction . After September 11th, Biden Suggested Sending 200 Million To Iran, No Strings Attached, As A Gesture Of Good Faith To The Arab World. At the Tuesdaymorning meeting with committee staffers, Biden launches into a streamofconsciousness monologue about what his committee should be doing, before he finally admits the obvious Im groping here. Then he hits on an idea America needs to show the Arab world that were not bent on its destruction. Seems to me this would be a good time to send, no strings attached, a check for 200 million to Iran Biden declares. He surveys the table with raised eyebrows, a How do ya like that look on his face.

"Weiner Sexting of 15YearOld Girl Leads to New FBI Investigation of Hillary Emails   The giant flaming garbage dump that is Clintonworld is offering up a wonderful new development sure to excite anyone who wanted to combine the Weiner scandal and the Hillary email scandal. Yes Virginia, you can now have both of them in one. Like peanut butter and jelly or shampoo and conditioner in one, theyve been merged into one horrible stinking landfill for your entertainment and the downfall of the republic. The FBI has reopened its investigation into Hillary Clintons use of a private server while secretary of state after discovering new emails  apparently during the probe of former Rep. Anthony Weiners sexting  in a stunning turn of events just days before the presidential election. FBI Director James Comey wrote in a letter to top members of Congress Friday that the bureau has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. Comey did not detail those emails, saying only that they surfaced in connection with an unrelated case. An FBI source, though, confirmed to Fox News that the new emails were discovered after the bureau seized devices belonging to disgraced Rep. Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin, a top Clinton aide who recently announced she was separating from the former congressman. The New York Times first reported on the Weiner investigation connection, noting the FBI had been probing texts Weiner sent to a 15yearold girl. As Donald Trump and congressional Republicans seized on the FBIs decision, interim Democratic Party leader Donna Brazile simply tweeted, Good grief, after the news of the Anthony Weiner connection broke. Cant argue with her there. It would be hilarious if Anthony Weiner and thereby Huma Abedin led to the downfall of Hillarys lifelong ambition. You just know someone is going to commit suicide in a D.C. park. But does anyone in the Democratic Party really look forward to 4 to 8 years of this This is how big of a mess Hillary is now.

"Obamas UN Ambassador Cuba is Right About Our Human Rights October 29, 2016 Daniel Greenfield You may remember Ambassador Samantha Power from the time she proposed invading Israel. Since then shes gone on to a glorious career of representing the Castro regime at the UN. Or is it the Obama regime. It naturally gets confusing when the US Ambassador to the UN sides with the enemy against her own country. For more than 50 years, the United States had a policy aimed at isolating the government of Cuba. For roughly half of those years, UN Member States have voted overwhelmingly for a General Assembly resolution that condemns the U.S. embargo and calls for it to be ended. The United States has always voted against this resolution. Today the United States will abstain. Applause. Thank you. Under Obama, Power was told to abstain from opposing a resolution critical of the United States. And they say Obama is some sort of antiAmerican traitor. I dont see it. If he were, we would be seeing signs of it by now. Anyway, Power then went on to audition for the job of the UN ambassador from Cuba by claiming that critiques from a brutal Communist dictatorship about our human rights are wellfounded... Let me be among the first to acknowledge  as our Cuban counterparts often point out  that the United States has work to do in fulfilling these rights for our own citizens. And we know that at times in our history, U.S. leaders and citizens used the pretext of promoting democracy and human rights in the region to justify actions that have left a deep legacy of mistrust. Somehow though siding with Communist dictatorships who are the enemy while betraying our allies in the region does not create any mistrust. Only opposing the left does.",hate
"Obamas DOJ Hasnt Approved Warrant for FBI of New Hillary Emails   Lynch and Obamas corrupted DOJ have switched to overtly undermining the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton. Remember those Hillary emails that have come up in the Weiner investigation As of Saturday night, the FBI had still not gotten approval from the Justice Department for a warrant that would allow agency officials to read any of the newly discovered Abedin emails, and therefore are still in the dark about whether they include any classified material that the bureau has not already seen. We do not have a warrant, a senior law enforcement official said. Discussions are under way between the FBI and the Justice Department as to the best way to move forward. This is Michael Isikoff so the spin is an attack on Comey. Though if Comey couldnt get Lynch to sign off on a warrant, the public announcement could very well have been his way of pressuring the DOJ to do the right thing. Now that the emails are an election issue, the only way to move forward is to allow the FBI to review them. But the Dems and the media are currently attacking Comey and the Isikoff piece is a typical example. Rather than tell the truth that the DOJ is obstructing the Hillary investigation, its smearing the FBI instead. As so many have pointed out, imagine if Nixon had been a Democrat. This is the way the media would have covered Watergate. Meanwhile the Dems are also screaming that Comey tell them about the emails that they refuse to grant him access to.",hate

I looked for all the devices that may have any of my State Department work on it and returned  returned  gave them to my attorneys for them to review for all relevant documents.

"Obamas Attorney General Warned FBI Director Not to Inform Congress of New Hillary Investigation   The media is shamelessly spinning this corrupt behavior by Attorney General Lynch as standard protocol and blasting the FBI from deviating from some imaginary standard in which Democratic presidential candidates are supposed to be immune from the consequences of their criminality . And Congress is meant to be kept in the dark. Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates disagreed with FBI Director James Comeys decision to notify Congress about his bureaus review of emails potentially related to Hillary Clintons personal server, law enforcement officials familiar with the discussion said. There was no direct confrontation between Lynch or Yates and Comey. Instead, the disagreements were conveyed to Comey by Justice Department staff, who advised the FBI chief his letter would be against department policy to not comment on investigations close to an election, the officials said. It is in line with policy though for Lynch to have met with Bill Clinton. But yes, a Hillary backer disagreed with a course of action damaging to her candidate. Comeydecided to disregard their concerns and sent the letter Friday anyway, shaking the presidential race 11 days before the election and nearly four months after the FBI chief said he wouldnt recommend criminal charges over the Democratic nominees use of the server. The officials acknowledged there was little Lynch and Yates could do given the fallout over Lynchs controversial meeting over the summer with former President Bill Clinton.

"Dems File Complaint w/DOJ Against FBI for Investigating Hillary   Its an obviously absurd move, but considering that the DOJ has become a transparently political organization that abuses and attacks law enforcement on a regular basis including, in the Eric Garner case, the FBI, this is just how things work in the hall of mirrors that the left has made . The Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed a complaint with the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility on Friday against FBI Director James Comey for interfering in the Presidential election, following the FBIs decision to open up an investigation into Secretary Clintons emails this close to Election Day. Federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the Hatch Act. It is absolutely absurd that FBI Director Comey would support Donald Trump like this with only 11 days to go before the election, said Scott Dworkin, Senior Advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump. It is an obvious attack from a lifelong Republican who used to serve in the Bush White House, just to undermine her campaign. Comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting America, not investigating our soon to be PresidentElect Hillary Clinton. Its silly grandstanding and seems easy enough to dismiss.Except that bizarre and unlikely tactics, no longer are. There was outrage over MoveOns attack on Petraeus and even most Dems thought that it was unhelpful. This attack on Comey I suspect will meet with little criticism.

"Sioux Indians Wish Dakota Pipeline Protesters Would Go Home October 30, 2016 Daniel Greenfield The ecoloons protesting the Dakota pipeline have the support of the media and the White House. But many of the local Sioux dont see them as defenders. They just wish they would go home . Ask around and youll hear stories of pipeline protesters whove traveled great distances. Theyve come from Japan, Russia and Germany. Australia, Israel and Serbia. And, of course, there are the allies, not exclusively Native American or indigenous, whove flocked here from all corners of the US. Demonstrating is their proud daily work. The obnoxious leftists of the world have united. And they want no pipelines or showers. No one makes this clearer than Robert Fool Bear Sr., 54, district chairman of Cannon Ball.

Its so close that, given the faceoffs with law enforcement, you have to pass through a police checkpoint to reach it. Its about time people heard from folks like him, he says. Fool Bear has had it with the protesters. He says that more than two years ago, when members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe could have attended hearings to make their concerns known, they didnt care. Now, suddenly, the crowds are out of control, and he fears its just a matter of time before someone gets seriously hurt. Go down to the camps, he says, and you wont see many Standing Rock Sioux. It irks me. People are here from all over the world, he says. If they could come from other planets, I think they would. And the Sioux are stuck helping leftist idiot protesters. Not long ago, he found three teenage girls from Ontario, Canada, camped out inside his storage shed. A white woman from Spokane, Washington, came to see him for help, saying shed come here with nothing and her car had broken down. When he was at the casino recently, someone approached him about two young kids who were on their own because their parents had been arrested. Even though Fool Bear is against the protests, that doesnt mean hes not preparing to help people out, too. He anticipates opening the community gymnasium for people without beds come winter, and a growing pile of sleeping bags and blankets sits in his office. Those protesters from Arizona, Georgia and California wont know what hit them when the cold rushes in, he says. Instead of helping the Sioux, privileged leftists have become a burden for them to take care of.",hate
"Media Spin The FBIs Actions Are Deeply Troubling, Not Hillarys   So the Hillary email investigation was reopened due to a sexting investigation of her close aides husband. So the media focused its outrage and disgust not on the gruesome WeinerAbedinHillary trio, but on the FBI. Reporting line from the alternate universe that the left inhabits, the media is brimming with headlines attacking the FBI for investigating Hillary. Hillary Clinton called the FBIs actions deeply troubling. They should be. For her. But instead the media made the propagandistic decision to upend the scandal coverage by portraying the FBIs actions in investigating Hillary as the scandal. Rather than Hillarys own actions. The agenda is blatantly obvious. But its also telling that the left has decided that the real scandal is investigating their own.",hate
"Obama Donations Funneled Through Fake Bonuses   This is some great investigative work. And its the kind of story that flies under the radar and its just a small component of the Democratic machine. But it is what the setup looks like . Jon Tester didnt come all the way from Montana for the scrambled eggs and bacon. The US senator, virtually unknown in Boston, was in a conference room at the Thornton Law Firm that June morning to cash in at one of the most reliable stops on the Democratic fundraising circuit, a law firm that pours millions into the coffers of the party and its politicians. Tester, a massive, jovial man who raises livestock on his family farm, was more compelling than many of the other breakfast guests, all of them political candidates the firm hoped would defend the interests of trial attorneys. But the drill was basically the same. The personal injury lawyers listened politely for a few minutes, then returned to their offices. And Tester walked away with 26,400 in checks. But a striking thing happened the day Tester visited in 2010. Partner David C. Strouss received a payment from the firm labeled as a bonus that exactly equaled his 2,400 contribution to Testers campaign, the maximum allowed. A few days later, partner Garrett Bradley  until recently the House assistant majority leader on Beacon Hill  got a bonus, too, exactly matching his 2,400 gift to Tester. Thats quite a coincidence. From 2010 through 2014, Strouss and Bradley, along with founding partner Michael Thornton and his wife, donated nearly 1.6 million to Democratic Party fundraising committees and a parade of politicians  from Senate minority leader Harry Reid of Nevada to Hawaii gubernatorial candidate David Ige to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Over the same span, the lawyers received 1.4 million listed as bonuses in Thornton Law Firm records more than 280 of the contributions precisely matched bonuses that were paid within 10 days. No corruption to see here. Now lets move on to another fake scandal. Thorntons lawyers were especially generous to Vice President Joe Biden, one of Washingtons strongest advocates for trial lawyers, contributing more than 78,000 to his campaigns from 2003 to 2008. During President Obama and Bidens reelection campaign in 2012, Michael Thornton hosted a fundraiser for the Obama Victory Fund at his house in Cambridge, where Biden was the guest of honor. Some of the biggest donors  some Thornton partners gave 20,000  were escorted into a private room and offered the chance to be photographed with Biden, said someone who was there. Thornton records show the lawyers were reimbursed for those donations. Hope and change.",hate
"Hillary Campaign Launching Attacks on the FBI October   If the Clinton campaign becomes any more deranged, Hillary will start running attack ads against the FBI. This kind of tactic is already perilously close to an attack ad. Hillary Clintons presidential campaign ratcheted up its attack on the director of the FBI on Sunday, circulating a draft letter critical of James Comey to former federal prosecutors. It is out of our respect for such settled tenets of the United States Department of Justice that we are moved to express our concern with the recent letter issued by FBI Director James Comey to eight Congressional Committees, the Clinton campaigns letter speaking for prosecutors said. The letter was signed and provided to The Daily Beast by Elkan Abramowitz, a former chief of the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. It is expected to be released Sunday evening. So we have the bizarre spectacle of Hillary deciding that she needs to campaign against the head of the FBI, who was just being praised for clearing her, because when youre a paranoid personality who assembles lists of enemies, this is how you react. But its also telling that the Clinton campaign finds this so threatening that it is waging war on the FBI.",hate
"Obamas DOJ Also Obstructed Clinton Foundation Investigation October   We now know that Lynch and Obamas DOJ are obstructing the investigation of Hillary Clintons emails. The biased media is predictably spinning this as the FBI being in the wrong and Hillarys backers at the DOJ being in the right. But it also appears that the DOJ was obstructing any investigations of Hillary. Including that of the Clinton Foundation. The FBI field office in New York had done the most work on the Clinton Foundation case and received help from the FBI field office in Little Rock, the people familiar with the matter said. In February, FBI officials made a presentation to the Justice Department, according to these people. By all accounts, the meeting didnt go well. Some said that is because the FBI didnt present compelling evidence to justify more aggressive pursuit of the Clinton Foundation, and that the career public integrity prosecutors in the room simply believed it wasnt a very strong case. Others said that from the start, the Justice Department officials were stern, icy and dismissive of the case. That was one of the weirdest meetings Ive ever been to, one participant told others afterward, according to people familiar with the matter. Justice Department officials told the FBI at the meeting they wouldnt authorize more aggressive investigative techniques, such as subpoenas, formal witness interviews, or grandjury activity. But the FBI officials believed they were well within their authority to pursue the leads and methods already under way, these people said. Of course the DOJ wouldnt authorize investigations of the Democratic Partys chosen. Thats the type of elemental corruption at work in the system.",hate
"ExAssistant FBI Director Clintons Are a Crime Family October   Thats quite an endorsement . And if theres anything top FBI officials now, its crime families. Certainly this is probably the first serious level of experience that Hillary can claim in any field. The Clintons, thats a crime family, basically, former assistant FBI director James Kallstrom said. Its like organized crime. I mean the Clinton Foundation is a cesspool. Kallstrom, best known for leading the investigation into the explosion of TWA flight 800 in the late 90s, said that Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, was a pathological liar. He also blasted Attorney General Loretta Lynch, claiming that she impeded the investigation into Clintons private server. The problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation, he said. Thats the problem. They never had a grand jury empanelled, and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled, Im sure, is Loretta Lynch would not go along with that. Kallstrom also said that FBI Director James Comey and the rest of the FBIs leadership were responsible for holding back the investigation, not the rest of the bureau. The agents are furious with whats going on, I know that for a fact, he said. But according to the media, the FBI investigating Hillary is the real crime.",hate
"Americans Seek to Help Persecuted Christians , Government Helps Muslims The people of the United States get it, but the Obama administration could care less. October 31, 2016 Originally published by the Gatestone Institute. Raymond Ibrahim is a Shillman Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center. As the Muslim persecution of Christians continues to reach critical proportions around the world see report below, the average American shows much more concern than the current administration. Soon after it was revealed that the Obama administration has taken in 5,435 Muslim refugees, but only 28 Christianseven though Christians are approximately 10 percent of Syrias population and are classified as experiencing a genocide therea poll found that more than three quarters of American respondents agreed with the statement It is important to me that the next US President be committed to addressing the persecution that some Christians face around the world eg., imprisonment, beheadings, rape, loss of home and assets. The deliberate targeting and killing of Christians in Europe also reached unprecedented levels in modern times. Most notably, on the morning of July 26,  Allahu Akbar  shouting Muslims stormed a small church in France during morning mass. They forced 85yearold Fr. Jacques Hamel to his knees, slit his throat, and  critically injured  a nun, before being killed by police. It was later revealed that police had known that church was being targeted and had even been monitoring one of the murderers for at least oneandahalf years. Later, when a journalist asked Pope Francis if Fr. Jacques was  killed in the name of Islam , the pope disagreed. He argued that he hears of Christians committing violence every day in Italy this one who has murdered his girlfriend, another who has murdered the motherinlaw and these are baptized Catholics There are violent Catholics If I speak of Islamic violence, I must speak of Catholic violence. The logic of the popes statement seems to be that violence done in direct contradiction of the JudeoChristian Gods commandmentssuch as the murder of wives and mothersinlawis identical to violence done in accordance with Allahs commandments to wage jihad on infidels. In ISIScontrolled territories in Iraq and Syria, reports of Christians being tortured to convert, maimed, crucified, burned alive, beheaded, or sold into sex slavery continued to emerge. In Iraq, a report says that Christians and other minorities in Iraq are facing persecution at unprecedented levels and are at the verge of extinction . The Christian population has dwindled from 1.4 million to 300,000 in the last decade, according to some estimates. However, Minority Rights Group put that the number at anywhere between 50,000 to 250,000. A former ISIS member exposed some of the atrocities the group commits in Syria. They were extremely brutal, killing women and the elderly who did not obey them. They abused and mutilated their dead bodies. They cut up the corpses, tied them to the back of the cars and dragged them along. They would find them and publicly execute them. I witnessed many executions. The remainder of Julys roundup of Muslim persecution of Christiansmost of which was not committed by ISISincludes, but is not limited to, the following Muslim Slaughter of Christians Nigeria  Two armed Muslim tribesmen murdered Rev. Joseph Kurah, an evangelical pastor, while he was working on his farm. They repeatedly hacked him to death with machetes. A local Muslim reportedly hired the assassins after he got into an argument with the Christian leader. Since 2001, Muslim Fulani have murdered thousands of Christians and destroyed hundreds of churches. According to a separate report , in just June and July, Muslim Fulani tribesmen targeted and invaded several Christian majority villages. They killed 133 people, destroyed 76 churches, and countless Christian properties and farms. Muslims hacked a female Christian preacher to death in the outskirts of Abuja. Eunice Elisha, a minister from the Redeemed Church of God, was found dead in a pool of her own blood after she went out to preach in the streets. A month earlier, on June 2, a Muslim mob beat Bridget Agbahime, the wife of a Christian pastor, to death with iron rods on the accusation that she blasphemed against Muhammad. About one million Christian children whose families have been displaced or affected by the violent activities of Boko Haram and Muslim Fulani herdsmen are starving. Churches, which are currently the primary supporters of these children, have gone beyond capacity and tens of thousands of children are expected to die of starvation and disease if they do not receive aid from elsewhere. According to the report, Boko Harams sevenyear rebellion has left 20,000 people dead and more than two million displaced. Philippines  Attacks and murders of Christians around Mindanao Island, which has a large Muslim population, are on the rise. Fr. Sebastiano DAmbra, who has lived in the region for 40 years, is calling on authorities to find proper solutions to stop the agony of the Christian community. He said, A Christian was killed in Jolo a few days ago. A reliable source told me that 20 Christians have been targeted to be killed or kidnapped soon. the Christian community is suffering a form of persecution from those who are guided by bad elements who claim to do it in the name of Islam. Kenya  Muslim gunmen from Al Shabaab murdered Pastor John as he was returning home from facilitating a peacemaking training seminar. The jihadis ambushed the bus he was in killing the pastor and six other people including children. Democratic Republic of Congo  Suspected Muslim militants armed with guns and machetes slaughtered nine Christians in the North Kivu region. They also looted homes, seizing food and cattle as plunder. The area, which is 96 percent Christian, has seen more than 1,100 killed over the last year and a half. Pakistan  The 2013 Muslim bombing of the All Saints Church in Peshawar, which killed more than 100 Christian worshippers, claimed its latest victim . After battling internal injuries she had received three years earlier from the attack, Cecilia, a 42yearold Christian nurse, died from bomb fragments embedded in her body that had turned cancerous. According to the report, With tearstained eyes, her husband noted that We are still losing loved ones after the attack. Forced Conversion, Rape and Murder of Christians Libya  A report documents the sufferings that Christians experience at the hands Muslim militants when they migrate through Libya in an effort to reach Europe. In one instance 11 women were abducted and kept as sex slaves underground and repeatedly raped by various jihadis for almost a year. One of the Christian women, Amal, 21, said They took the Christians to Tripoli and kept us underground  we didnt see the sun for nine months. Sometimes we didnt eat for three days. Other times they would give us one meal a day, half a piece of bread. The Christian woman described how they were pressured into converting to Islam under threat of death and beaten with hoses or sticks. Sometimes they would frighten us with their guns, or threaten to slaughter us with their knives. Islamic State  ISIS has been making use of social mediaincluding Facebook, and mobile apps like WhatAPP, and Telegram to sell enslaved Christian and Yazidi girls to a wider network of sadists and pedophiles. One Telegram posting showed a picture of a young girl with the caption Virgin. Beautiful. 12 years old, the posting states. Her price has reached 12,500 and she will be sold soon. Nigeria Another report says that the Muslim terrorist group, Boko Haram, has murdered 466 people, almost all of whom were Christian, for refusing to convert to Islam they also forced 218 women and young girls to marry their fighters. Pakistan  Muslims kidnapped and forced a 14yearold Christian girl to convert to Islam last May. Her father pled with them for weeks to release his daughter. They eventually pretended to relent, told him to meet them somewhere so they could return his daughter, and, once he arrived, shot him dead . The girl remains with the rapists, the slain fathers widow and three other daughters are hiding in their home in fear of further reprisals from the kidnappers. According to Najma Bibi, the girls mother several months after my daughters kidnapping, the police have not done anything because we have no money to defend our rights. We live in a hopeless situation, we need help. I pray that my daughter will continue to place hope and faith in Jesus Christ. Muhammad Iqrar, a Muslim man, assaulted and raped Sonia Nasar, a 16yearold Christian girl. Although the rapist fled when her father rushed to the scene after hearing the cries of his daughter, Sonia was left in critical condition. He said that he expects no justice or follow up from local authorities, some of whom are associated with the rapist. Sobia Nadeem, a Christian girl studying for a Masters degree in physics, was abducted by a group of Muslims, forced to convert to Islam, and forced to marryat gunpointa man named Mohammad Hamza in Lahore. Although the girl managed to escape back to her parents home, she was taken to court where her family had to prove that her conversion and marriage were performed under force. Numerous reports continued to appear indicating that nonMuslim students, most often Christians, are being forced to convert to Islam through the public school system. Teachers force them to recite the shahadawhich when said before Muslim witnesses makes the reciter a Muslimand force them to study Muslim beliefs and practices. This often occurs in conjunction with denigration of the Christian faith. Due to ongoing Christian protests, the Punjab government said it would launch an inquiry. Muslim Attacks on Christian Churches and Symbols Turkey  During the July 15 failed coup attempt, at least two churches were attacked . One of the attacks happened in Trabzon. A group of 10 people attacked Santa Maria Church with paving stones and hammers to smash the windows said the report. One church leader in Istanbul said, Im not optimistic about the plight of Christians in Turkey. Bear in mind weve had a Roman Catholic Bishop murdered, weve had clergy threatened, weve had one priest murdered 10 years ago. Any Christian leader, if theyre being honest, would say that some of whats going on is quite alarming. Nigeria  On Friday, July 15, Muslims attacked a Catholic church. They were angered that Christians were praying in the church on Friday, Islams holy day, when Muslims congregate and pray in mosques. According to a Christian church leader, Sometime around 2pm, some Muslim youths in their hundreds left their mosque after their Friday Jumat prayer and rushed to the church premises, climbed the wall and destroyed everything in the church the windows, the altar, musical instruments, the chapel. The security man in the church premises was beaten to a pulp. Some women holding a prayer meeting were chased away. The seminarian, who is resident in the premises, was also beaten up and chased away. Iraq  According to a new report , All 45 churches and monasteries inside Mosul are reportedly now occupied by ISIS, who have looted, burned and destroyed property, in addition to removing the buildings crosses. Christians unable to flee are forced to pay large extortion money jizya or risk instant execution. Sudan  A report notes that by continuously bombing Christian and nonMuslim indigenous regions near South Sudan, and targeting churches and pastors homes for destruction, the government is trying to cleanse the nation of Christians and create a homogenous Muslim state. In recent years, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by the violence, their homes, crops, churches, schools and hospitals destroyed. Indonesia  Despite receiving all legal documents and permits, a Catholic family trying to construct a shrine to the Virgin Mary on their own land since 2009 continued to face growing threats from local Muslims. In 2012, a Muslim mob set fire to the shrine site and brought construction to a halt. Most recently in July, Muslims stormed the house of a Catholic leader and ordered him to stop the work, even though he has a building permit issued by the authorities. Muslim Attacks on Christian Apostates, Blasphemers, and Preachers Egypt  According to a report , Just like the biblical character Daniel in the lions den, an Egyptian Muslim who converted to Christianity found himself at the mercy of ferocious attack dogs that were unleashed by his jailers to torture and possibly kill him. However, law student Majed El Shafie had God on his side and, just like in the story about Daniel, the savage animals miraculously did not harm himto the utter astonishment of his prison guards. He was, however, tortured by the Muslim guards themselves. Uganda  Another Muslim convert to Christianity has lost his family, home, and business, and now lives in a small shanty. As a result of his apostasy, the extended family of the 53yearold man, a former Muslim imam, stormed and eventually appropriated his ancestral home in an attempt on his life. Of that night, he said I heard people talking outside my house around 8 p.m., saying that they wanted to take away my life and, We cannot watch the whole family turning to Christianity. He complained to the local council after his relatives also destroyed his business, but their intervention had no effect and he now lives without any means to provide for himself. Pakistan  Nadeem James, a 27yearold Christian man and father of two, was arrested in Gujarat district after a Muslim angry with him accused James of texting a poem deemed blasphemous of Muhammad. According to the accuseds brother We were not at home when the police raided our house to arrest Nadeem. However, when the cops couldnt find any of us in the premises, they took away two women of the family  my wife and the wife of my elder brother, Faryad. Around the same time, local mosques began calling on megaphones that if he didnt surrender himself, Christian homes would burn. Nadeem surrendered himself and the women were released. The charge against my brother is completely baseless. Nadeem is uneducated and could not have possibly sent that text message. Im certain that Yasir Bashir Muslim accuser downloaded the supposedly blasphemous text onto Nadeems phone and then forwarded it to his cell number to build a case against my brother. Yaqoob Masih, 56, a Christian sanitary worker, was accused of committing blasphemy against Islam in Hyderabad. According to the report, Masih collected waste from the streets and dumped it at a specific location, however Bakash Muslim accuser, without verifying, tortured Masih with a stick, accusing him of committing blasphemy by burning pages of a book which reportedly carried Islamic verses. Masih was packing the garbage and waste in a trunk when Bakash accused him of blasphemy. Masih was hospitalized from his injuries. A Muslim doctor who treated a dying Christian man with medicine that was donated through zakat, Islamic charity, received death threats . The Christian was on the verge of dying without treatment. In his defense, the Muslim doctor said he did not know the man was a Christian, or that it was against some interpretations of Islamic law to use Muslim charity money to help nonMuslims. Iran  Three Azerbaijani pastors were arrested in Tehran during a visit. No reason was given to family and local legal experts. According to the report, This is the latest in a succession of pastors who have been imprisoned by Iranian authorities over many years for accusations ranging from apostasy to evangelism. And Ebrahim Firouzi, who has been under arrest since 2013 under vague charges suffered physical abuse at the hands of prison guards when he was forced to attend an appeal hearing. Dhimmitude Muslim Contempt and Hostility for Christians Bangladesh  Christian and Hindu businesses received notices from a banned Islamic organization ordering them to uphold a number of Islamic customs or be killed. These include hanging banners with Allahs name, keeping copies of the Koran, putting pictures of the Kaba in Mecca, removing pictures or statues of their own religions, creating a place for Muslims to pray, and banning music and female workers. Pakistan  The government in the Raiwind district flooded a Christian graveyard with sewage water and desecrated all the graves. In response, protesting Christians complained that even in the grave they can receive no peace in Pakistan. Sudan  Authorities insulted, forcefully arrested and jailed 14 Christians when they attempted to stop them from seizing an evangelical school on church property, which authorities plan on giving to Muslim businesses. Later, authorities returned to the same Christian school, gave letters of dismissal to the Christian headmistress, vandalized her office, and replaced her with a teacher of their own choosing. Egypt  After a Christian man was stabbed to death and many Christian homes and a church burned by angry Muslims because of a rumor that a church was going to be built, Coptic Christian Bishop Makarious of alMinya was interviewed on television. Church authorities in Egypt are regularly diplomatic and sensitive to what they say, but Makarious made many revealing comments. Although only Christians, no Muslims, were killed and hurt, he wondered why the government and media continue to describe these incidents as clasheswhich suggests two quarrelling partieswhen the reality is always that one side attacks the other Within minutes of the start of one of the attacks, 100 Muslims instantly appeared, fully armed, as if ready for war. He added As long as the attackers are never punished, and the armed forces are portrayed as doing their duty, this will just encourage others to continue the attacks, since, even if they are arrested, they will be quickly released. When the host asked questions about who is released and why, suggesting that perhaps those released are in fact innocent of any wrongdoing against the Christians, the bishop replied Well what do you think when the actual attackers themselves are arrested, with complete proofs and evidences against them, but then they are still declared innocent and released this happens every single time. About this Series The persecution of Christians in the Islamic world has become endemic. Accordingly, Muslim Persecution of Christians was developed to collate someby no means allof the instances of persecution that surface each month. It serves two purposes 1 To document that which the mainstream media does not the habitual, if not chronic, persecution of Christians. 2 To show that such persecution is not random, but systematic and interrelatedthat it is rooted in a worldview inspired by Islamic Sharia. Accordingly, whatever the anecdote of persecution, it typically fits under a specific theme, including hatred for churches and other Christian symbols apostasy, blasphemy, and proselytism laws that criminalize and sometimes punish with death those who offend Islam sexual abuse of Christian women forced conversions to Islam theft and plunder in lieu of jizya financial tribute expected from nonMuslims overall expectations for Christians to behave like cowed dhimmis , or thirdclass, tolerated citizens and simple violence and murder. Sometimes it is a combination thereof. Because these accounts of persecution span different ethnicities, languages, and localesfrom Morocco in the West, to Indonesia in the Eastit should be clear that one thing alone binds them Islamwhether the strict application of Islamic Sharia law, or the supremacist culture born of it.

"Freedom Center Urges College Presidents to End Aid to Campus Supporters of Terror We ask that you withdraw all university privileges granted to SJP. October 31, 2016 Frontpagemag.com Editors Note The following letter was sent to the presidents of the ten campuses named in the Freedom Centers report on the Top Ten Schools Supporting Terrorists. In alphabetical order, the ten campuses are Brooklyn College CUNY, San Diego State University, San Francisco State University, Tufts University, University of California, Berkeley, University of California, Irvine, University of California, Los Angeles, University of Chicago, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and Vassar College. October 27, 2016 University of California Dear Dr. Napolitano, Your school purports to promote the values of diversity, inclusiveness and tolerance yet provides resources, funding and legitimacy to Students for Justice in Palestine. Students for Justice in Palestine is a campus organization whose sole purpose is to conduct hateful propaganda against Jews and the Jewish state for the terrorist organization Hamas. The explicit goals of Hamas are the destruction of the worlds only Jewish state and genocide against its Jewish population. For these reasons, among others, three campuses of the University of CaliforniaIrvine, Los Angeles, and Berkeleyhave been named among the Top Ten Schools Supporting Terrorists by the David Horowitz Freedom Center. You may read the full report here http//www.stopthejewhatredoncampus.org/news/toptenschoolssupportingterroristsfall2016report While it masquerades as a typical campus cultural group, SJP is an integral part of Hamass efforts to annihilate Israel through the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions BDS campaign. This is an insidious effort that attempts to delegitimize Israel, and smear it as a rogue apartheid nation. These claims are ludicrous. More than a million Palestinians enjoy Israeli citizenship including the rights to vote and to sit on the Israeli courts and parliament. Harvard Professor Alan Dershowitz has said of the BDS movement, It is antiSemitic, antiZionist, antihuman rights, antiintellectual, antiscience, antinegotiation, antipeace, anticompromise, and antiPalestinian workers when they are denied opportunities to work. Both Larry Summers and Hillary Clinton have denounced BDS as antiSemitic Jew hatred. Yet your school provides a platform and funding for its sponsors. With university support, SJP also conducts Israeli apartheid hate weeks on campus quads. These events feature proHamas advocates, the construction of apartheid walls featuring proHamas, antiSemitic propaganda, and the creation of mock checkpoints and dieins that disrupt student movements on campus. SJP actively disrupts proIsrael campus eventsa threat to free speech and a violation of your universitys stated values and rules of conduct. In addition to being scripted by Hamas terrorists, SJPs proterror campaign is funded and guided through a Hamas front called American Muslims for Palestine. In recent testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Jonathan Schanzer, who worked as a terrorism finance analyst for the United States Department of the Treasury from 20042007, described how Hamas funnels large sums of money and provides material assistance to Students for Justice in Palestine SJP through the Hamas front group American Muslims for Palestine AMP for the purpose of promoting BDS campaigns on American campuses. AMP was created by SJP cofounder Hatem Bazian, a proterrorist lecturer at UC Berkeley who called for a suicide bombing Intifada inside the United States. It employs highranking officials from other Muslim charities that were previously shut down for providing material assistance to terrorists. Schanzer described AMP as arguably the most important sponsor and organizer for Students for Justice in Palestine SJP, which is the most visible arm of the BDS campaign on campuses in the United States. He detailed how AMP provides speakers, training, printed materials, a socalled Apartheid Wall, and grants to SJP activists and even has a campus coordinator on staff whose job is to work directly with SJP and other proBDS campus groups across the country. Furthermore, according to an email it sent to subscribers, AMP spent 100,000 on campus activities in 2014 alone. Students for Justice in Palestine continues to accept funding and aid through the Hamas front group American Muslims for Palestine. Despite its links to terrorist organizations and agendas, Students for Justice in Palestine continues to receive campus funds and campus privileges, including university offices, and the right to hold events preaching the genocidal values of Hamas on university property. These privileges would normally be denied to groups that preach hatred of any other ethnic group, let alone one that supports barbaric terrorists who slaughter men, women and children with the goal of cleansing the earth of people who disagree with them. In light of these facts, we ask that you withdraw all university privileges granted to SJP and other campus groups who promote the genocidal Hamas agenda, and that you put an end to the terrorist influences which have infiltrated your campus and which threaten the security not only of Jewish students on your campus, but of all Americans.

"Meet Hillary Clintons Secretary of State Send a 200 million check to Iran. October 31, 2016 Daniel Greenfield Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. September 11, 2001 has come and gone. Countless bodies lie scattered in fragments around where two of the countrys tallest skyscrapers once stood. Some have burned to ash. Others had their throats slashed by Islamic terrorists. Still others fought and died on a plane to prevent another Islamic terror attack from taking place. But Joe has an idea. Joe is a guy with lots of big ideas and this one is a real doozy. The Senator from Delaware has come a long way since his days as a sixties shyster drumming up business in Wilmington. His formerly bald head is covered in hair so shiny is gleams under neon lights. His teeth are capped and shine almost as brightly. After a generation holding down a squeaky seat in the Senate, seniority makes him a man to be reckoned with. And therefore a man to be listened to. Even if you wish he would shut up. Im groping here, Joe says. For once he isnt referring to his notorious habits with women that will go on to make him the star of countless viral photographs, massaging, squeezing, caressing. Instead hes talking about foreign policy. The Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has no clue. Joe is worried that the Muslims will think badly of us after they murdered thousands of us. And he has a plan to make them feel better. Seems to me this would be a good time to send, no strings attached, a check for 200 million to Iran, Senator Joe Biden says. The remark isnt quite as random as it seems. The Senator from Delaware, a state not known for its large Muslim or Iranian population, has a friendly relationship with the Iran Lobby. That relationship will only grow friendlier during the Bush era as he attacks America and appeases its enemies. IranianAmericans who hate the Jihadist government that has taken over their country and oppressed the Persian people are outraged when he attends a fundraiser at a proIranian lobbyists home in California while treasonously attacking his own government for naming Iran one of the members of the Axis of Evil. Joes usual Amtrak obsession wouldnt get him in the door in California, but treason, hair plugs and capped teeth make him a big hit outside Delaware. And Joe remains very fond of Iran. He informs Israeli officials that Israel will have to reconcile itself with the nuclearization of Iran. And thats all the way back in 08 before the deal that puts Iran on the path to a Shiite bomb was a nuclear twinkle in Obamas eye and a radioactive itch in Hillarys socks. That was a big year for Biden. It was his first and biggest shot at the big chair in the White House. Joe had tried it in 88 and was stomped by Dukakis, of all people, after being caught plagiarizing a speech by British politician Neil Kinnock. 08 got him a useless position in the White House as a consolation prize. This time around Joe Biden is expected to get the same consolation prize from Hillary Clinton that she got from Barack Obama the office of Secretary of State of the United States. Of all the jobs that Joe Biden wants and is utterly unfit for, Amtrak train engineer, secret agent and the guy in charge of counting all the money at the bar, its hard to think of one that hes less fit for. Joe Biden blamed Darfur on the Gingrich Revolution. He fell in love with the Taliban. The Taliban per se is not our enemy, Joe insisted. There is not a single statement that the president has ever made in any of our policy assertions that the Taliban is our enemy. He suggested that 95 of the Taliban were probably okay and only 5 were incorrigible. Most of the Taliban, he seemed to think, were, like Joe Biden, just in it for the money. But Joe Biden has a soft spot for Islamic terrorists whether theyre the Shiite Jihadists of Iran or the Sunni Jihadists of the Taliban. Joe loves all the terrorists of the world and the terrorists love him back. It wasnt that long ago that we were being lectured to by the media on Bushs ruination of relations with the rest of the world. If Biden were to become Secretary of State, he would become the third Democratic presidential campaign loser to get the job as a consolation prize for his failures as a politician. The last time a professional held down the job would have been the Bush administration. And yet, perversely, each loser Secretary has been more incompetent than the last. Hillarys disastrous time as Secretary of State could only be exceeded by John Kerry who gave away everything to the Russians and who was contradicted by the White House so many times it would have humiliated a lesser man. Or just any man. The only loser who could follow two class acts like that was Joe Biden. Joe Bidens amateur diplomacy has been one disaster after another. Even his visit to Israel, a friendly ally not known for fractious political visits by American politicians, became an international incident with Biden sulking in his room while Hillary yelled at Prime Minister Netanyahu for 45 minutes over the phone. But somehow Biden, with his gift for appeasing Iran and the Taliban, alienates allies. Just this year, Joe Biden launched yet another attack on Israel. A cynic might almost think that Tehran Joe loves Islamic terrorists and hates those who resist them and fight against them. Biden has claimed that terrorism is not an existential threat. He accused President Bush of being shortsighted for using the military to fight Islamic terrorists. He argued that the perception that we want to stay in Iraq helps Al Qaeda. Some years later, his administrations decision to pull out led to the rise of ISIS. He called for closing Gitmo while insisting that it had become the greatest propaganda tool that exists for recruiting of terrorists around the world. Senator Joe Biden was a voice for appeasement. Vice President Joe Biden was part of an administration that empowered and unleashed the malignant power of Islamic terror. Secretary of State Joe Biden would be able to act out his worst fantasies. He could even write that check to Iran. Though the ObamaBiden era has seen cash transfers to Iran that make Joes 200 million check seem like chump change. Hillary Clintons rise doesnt just mean that she will be making big decisions. It will mean that Joe Biden will have gone from a Wilmington shyster to running the foreign policy of a country he has betrayed.",hate
"Hillary Clinton and the Presidents  Longer Game . At home and abroad, a nation less affluent, less free, and far less secure. October 31, 2016 Lloyd Billingsley The President of the United States, the most powerful man in the world, used a pseudonym to communicate with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on her private, unsecured email server. As Andrew McCarthy contended , that was the reason the FBI declined to prosecute Clinton, because the president would have been part of the same action, and that wouldnt be politically correct. The current president of the United States is also on record that, contrary to custom, he will linger in Washington DC for a few years. Wherever he chooses to live, the email intrigue suggests continuing backchannel communications with Hillary Clinton, should she become president. That invites a look at what the man the New York Times dubbed Obamas narrator, the White House adviser who sat closest to the president and signed off on his every word, had to say about the presidents vision of the future. Few of the decisions he had made would satisfy the politics of the moment, David Axelrod explained in his massive 2015 Believer . But at home and abroad, Obama was playing a longer game. As he explained in Columbia, Missouri, on October 30, 2008, We are five days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America. If this man was a liberal, as Barry Rubin wondered in Silent Revolution How the Left Rose to Political Power and Cultural Dominance , why did he see a need fundamentally to transform a nation shaped by liberals such as Franklin Roosevelt with his New Deal and Lyndon Johnson with his Great Society He saw the need because he was not a liberal but a lifelong leftist radical. As David Horowitz explained in Volume 7 of the Black Book of the American Left , the president was born, bred and trained in the progressive movement. His mentors were Communists and their progressive successors, so no wonder he presided over the institutionalizing of the policies of the left in government for eight years. What that means in practical terms is becoming painfully evident. The economy remains sluggish and under Obamacare, the presidents signature plan, premiums are skyrocketing . This suggests that, as many believe, Obamacare was simply a demolition plan. In the longer game, designated successor Hillary Clinton will impose government monopoly healthcare, what some candidates erroneously call socialized medicine. As Rubin noted, the goal of the left is to convince Americans the exact opposite of what their experience proved that the country had fundamentally failed and the old leftist solutions were the answer. The result may be a very longterm and even permanent change of the United States into something else, a nation far less affluent and far less free. And far less secure, as David Axelrod also indicates. Vladimir Putin makes an appearance in Believer but Obamas narrator does not outline Putins background in the KGB. The believer includes nothing about Putins role in East Germany, a Stalinist police state that walled in its subjects and shot those attempting to escape. The narrator avoids Putins belief that the breakup of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century. In Believer , Putin tells the president, You are a highly educated man. I come from the security sector. The believer then asks the president for his assessment of Putin. Hes smart, tough, clear about his interests and without a trace of sentimentality, the president says. That is not very strong language for a KGB veteran and expansionist autocrat. In his narrators account, the president uses the word motherf",hate
"Search Selective Outrage Over SPLCs AntiMuslim Extremist List Leftists and atheists appalled that SPLCs hit list of Islam critics includesLeftists and atheists. October 31, 2016 Robert Spencer Sam Harris thinks its unbelievable that Maajid Nawaz and Ayaan Hirsi Ali made it to the Southern Poverty Law Centers hit list of AntiMuslim Extremists. He said nothing about me or the other people whom the SPLC included, which is not surprising, since he has quite recently expressed willingness to acquiesce in other contexts to the demonization that the SPLC list exemplifies. Hemant Mehta of The Friendly Atheist blog ably sums up the outrage over Nawaz and Hirsi Ali being included If criticizing religious beliefs makes them extremists, then it wont be long before other vocal atheists end up on that list too. And make no mistake, thats what Nawaz and Hirsi Ali are doing. Thats all theyre doing. Theyre not antiMuslim they work with moderate Muslims. Theyre critical of the worst aspects of Islam. The problem with being angry about Nawaz and Hirsi Ali being on the SPLC list, but silent about everyone else who is on it, is that what Mehta says about Nawaz and Hirsi Ali can quite accurately said about everyone else on the list. If criticizing religious beliefs makes them extremists, then it wont be long before everyone who dares to utter a critical word about Islam will be on the list  and that is indeed the objective of the list to stigmatize and marginalize any and all such critics. Mehta protests that Nawaz and Hirsi Ali are not antiMuslim they work with moderate Muslims. Theyre critical of the worst aspects of Islam. But no one would think that the other 13 were antiMuslim if it hadnt been for the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Hamaslinked Council on AmericanIslamic Relations CAIR and their allied groups insisting that we were all these years, in their avidity to conflate opposition to jihad terror and Sharia oppression with hating a group of people  a tactic designed to discredit opposition to jihad terror and Sharia oppression. Mehta and co. are falling for and validating the same smear tactics hey are decrying when used against their friends. And as for working with moderate Muslims, for 13 years Jihad Watch has contained this invitation  Any Muslim who renounces violent jihad and dhimmitude is welcome to join in our antijihadist efforts. It is Nawaz as well as other moderates who has attacked me, in what appears to have been a cynical attempt to gain support for himself among Muslims I never attacked him, and would have have been happy to work with him otherwise. In complaining that Nawaz and Hirsi Ali are merely criticizing religious beliefs and are not antiMuslim, Mehta is strongly implying that the others on the SPLC list are doing something beyond criticizing religious beliefs and are indeed antiMuslim. On Twitter the last couple of days Ive seen many people express outrage that Nawaz has been lumped in with the likes of Spencer but when I ask them what the big difference is between us, or for quotes from me that are actually bigoted, they go silent. Mehta, Harris, Haider and the others who are only angry with the SPLCs hit list because it included Nawaz and Hirsi Ali are, by their selective outrage, acquiescing to and legitimizing the SPLCs demonization of the other people on the list. In his own defense, Hemant Mehta wrote me to explain, somewhat unsatisfactorily I focused on those two because theyre well known in atheist circles. This is a selfdefeating choice for them to have made, for the SPLC has never identified anyone whom it considers to be a legitimate critic of Islam, and never will the point of lists such as the one they released yesterday is to demonize and silence everyone who dares say something about Islam that is not warmly positive. The turn of Mehta, Harris, and Haider will come for the same treatment. One wonders if, when this happens, there will be anyone left to speak for them who has not already been smeared as antiMuslim, with their tacit approval.",hate
"A resolution on Jerusalem that will fuel antiJewish incitement and violence. October 31, 2016 Joseph Puder If anyone doubted the fact that the United Nations agencies harbored a deepseated antiIsrael and antiJewish animus, the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization UNESCO vote on Jerusalem proved it. The UNESCO World Heritage Committee voted this week October 26, 2016 on a resolution dealing with Jerusalem, drafted by the Palestinian and Jordanian delegations, and submitted by Kuwait, Lebanon and Tunisia all Arab Muslim states. The Executive Committee of UNESCO approved 10 for, 2 opposed, 8 abstained, and 1 missing the resolution that was already voted on earlier this month in which 24 memberstates approved the resolution Algeria, Bangladesh, Brazil, Cuba, Chad, Dominican Republic, Egypt, Iran, Lebanon, Malaysia, Morocco, Mauritius, Mexico, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Russia, Senegal, South Africa, Sudan and Vietnam 6 opposed Estonia, Germany, Lithuania, The Netherlands, UK, and the U.S.. Among the abstaining 26 states were Argentina, France, Greece, India, Japan, Kenya, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka and Sweden. The resolution deeply decries the continuous Israeli aggressions against civilians including Islamic religious figures and priests, decries the forceful entering into the different mosques and historic buildings, and into Muslim holy sites by Israelis, including employees of the socalled Israeli Antiquities. Israel is urged to end these aggressions and abuses which inflame the tension on the ground and between faiths. According to Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch, a Genevabased watchdog organization, the resolution, which is likely to be adopted, Dangerously risks fueling antiJewish incitement and violence, and legitimizing the escalating Palestinian denial of Jewish and cultural rights. Neuer added that, This inflammatory narrative, praised last week by Hamas, rewards the past years relentless Palestinian stabbing and shooting attacks in Jerusalem and other parts of Israel, which we mustnt forget, began with false claims that Israel was planning to damage the holy Muslim Shrines. The expected resolution mentions eleven times AlHaram AlSharif, the Muslim designation to what Jews call Har Habayit, the holiest shrine in Judaism where the Temple of Solomon stood and also known as Temple Mount. With the Islamic bloc controlling the largest voting bloc in the UN, it is no wonder that a resolution of this kind can be approved. OIC Organization of Islamic Cooperation, being the largest and most influential bloc at the UN, it might as well declare that the earth is flat, and it will garner a majority vote at the General Assembly or its other UN constituent agencies. What this resolution effectively does to Jerusalem is to Islamize sites historically belonging to other faiths. The latest draft does not describe the Western Wall as the most hallowed remains of the Jewish Holy Temple destroyed by the Romans in 70CE, but as The Western Wall of Al Aqsa Mosque, in a blatant effort to erase the Jewish heritage and biblical truth, and as part of a campaign to Islamize the site. It shamelessly disregards the fact that Jewish worshippers have prayed at the Wall for over two thousand years. The language of the draft resolution continues the deliberate attempt by the Palestinian Authority PA to deny the Jewish historical connection to the Land of Israel in general and to Jerusalem in particular. Mahmoud Abbas has continued on the path of denial that Arafat initiated at Camp David. Among the charges brought up by the PA and the other ArabMuslim states for undertaking the resolution is that the Jerusalem light rail, which is used daily by thousands of Arab residents of Jerusalem, is having a damaging effect on the visual integrity and the authentic character of the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem. Yet the rail tracks pass through an existing highway and facilitates effective transportation for visitors of all faiths. Preceding the shameless resolution and the vote that took place in the Paris headquarters of UNESCO, Israels president, Reuven Rivlin stated at an event in his Jerusalem residence, No forum or body in the world can come and deny the connection between the Jewish people, the Land of Israel and Jerusalem  and any such body that does so simply embarrasses itself. We can understand criticism, but you cannot change history. UNESCOs Director General, Irina Bokova and the Chairman of UNESCOs Executive Board, Michael Worbs, expressed displeasure and apologized for the resolution. In an interview with Israeli TV Channel 10 on October 14, 2016 the day following the vote, Worbs said he hoped that the Boards Tuesday meeting will be delayed in order to reach consensus on the resolution before a formal vote. Bokova, on her part, expressed her dismay at the resolution, saying that efforts to deny history and the Citys Jerusalem complex multifaith character, harms UNESCO. Earlier, in July, 2016 Bokova stated that, The heritage of Jerusalem is indivisible, and each of its communities have a right to the explicit recognition of their history and relationship with the city. To deny or conceal any of the Jewish, Christian or Muslim traditions undermines the integrity of the site, and runs counter to the reasons that justified its inscription in 1981 as a World Heritage site. UNESCO can be counted as one of the most antiIsrael UN agencies. In the course of a typical year, the organizations legislative bodies will condemn Israel 10 or more times, with no criticism aimed at any other country in the world. In 2009 for example, UNESCO adopted 10 antiIsrael decisions , eight at the 181 st and 182 nd sessions of the Executive Board, and two at the 35 th session of the General Conference. Again in 2010, UNESCO adopted 10 antiIsrael decisions at the 184 th and 185 th sessions of the Executive Board. In 2011, UNESCO again adopted 10 antiIsrael decisions at the 186 th and 187 th sessions of the Executive Board and two resolutions against Israel at the 36 th session of the General Conference. Whereas Jerusalem was King Davids capital and continued to be the capital of the Second Jewish Commonwealth, as well as Israels capital today, it was never the capital of any Arab or Muslim empire, Caliphate, or entity, nor was Jerusalem a spiritual center that Muslims yearned for. The Umayyad Caliphate had its capital in Damascus. The Abbasside Caliphate capital was Baghdad, and the Ottoman Empires Caliphate capital was Constantinople. Ramle, a small town in Israel, was its administrative capital in Palestine  not Jerusalem. A Palestinian state never existed as an independent entity, and the PA claims on Jerusalem are strictly contrarian  to deny Jerusalem as the heart of Jewish spirituality and yearning. Jerusalem exists in every Jewish prayer, and is invoked on every occasion and holiday. Dore Gold, former Director General of Israels Foreign Ministry, addressed last years UNESCOs Jerusalem resolution. He pointed out that the resolution glossed over any Jewish connection to Jerusalem, and it failed to acknowledge Christianitys ties to Jerusalem. Most dismaying is the fact that Christian nations who voted for the resolution or abstained, have abandoned all vestiges of pride and honor, and are willing to deny historical truth for narrow political interests. Brazil, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic, predominantly Catholic states, are a case in point. Unfortunately other Christian countries including France, Spain, Greece, Argentina, and Sweden, who should know about Jerusalem from their church bibles, did not have the courage to reject this outrageously false resolution. It can only lead to the conclusion that perhaps cowardice and latent antiSemitism drove their decision to accept, not reject this infamous resolution.",hate
"Is Hillary Panicking Over the FBI and Weiner Emails   These past few days have seen a major shift in the Clinton tactics. During the original investigation, the Clinton campaign and its political and media allies launched attacks at Republicans for wasting time investigating Hillary, but did not attack the FBI. It misrepresented FBI statements, but it certainly did not target investigators in the way were seeing now. But now we have open hostilities between Lynch at the DOJ and the FBI. We have the Clinton campaign circulating a letter attacking the FBI. We have countless media hit pieces aimed at the FBI. The obvious question is why. The Clinton campaign kept its cool, at least to some degree, before. It certainly didnt begin an illadvised campaign against the FBI. Thats the kind of tactic that may play to your core base, but alienates everyone else. That is to say everyone who isnt in the media. So whats going on here 1. The Clintons thought they were done. Its close to the election. So theyre lashing out. Its typically paranoid and nasty behavior by the Clintons. Hillary tried playing humble. She tried apologizing. But a moment ago, her victory seemed inevitable, and now shes in a state of fury at having it put at risk. 2. There is something in those emails that genuinely frightens the Clinton campaign. Which is why it took the crazy risk of going after the FBI with both barrels. Its desperate to smear the FBI as much as possible in order to neutralize any revelations or even potential charges. The attacks are a warning to treat Hillary with kid gloves again... or else. The first is plausible. To a degree. But for all of Hillarys awkwardness, she didnt lose it in the past. Why is she losing it now Theres no evidence beyond speculation for the latter. And yet the major shift in tactics is rather striking. If the Clinton campaign were panicking, this is what it would look like.",hate
"2 Reminders to Ignore the Trump is Doomed Polls   Weve recently had two object lessons in the worthlessness of the Trump is Doomed polling saga. A few days ago, the media was loudly trumpeting that Hillarys victory was inevitable, that the polls were in and she was going to ignore Trump and focus on building her administration and winning downticket races. And then, just like last time around, the numbers turned around again. I was recently asked to predict the race. I answered that the one thing I could predict is that the media will claim a landslide for Hillary right before the election. That much is very likely. Its in the medias interest to spread FUD by promoting polls that predict not just a Hillary win, but a landslide, creating the perception that voting is useless. The more Republicans feel that the outcome is futile, the less likely they will be to go out and vote. But the scandal polling numbers have a history of rebounding. This remains a challenging and very unusual election. The premature panic weve seen in some circles is unhealthy. We shouldnt completely ignore poll numbers, but neither should we treat them as inevitable. Weve had two major lessons in why thats short sighted.",hate
"Hillary Clinton Hits Unfavorability High of 60, Higher Than Trump October 31,   Remember last week when Hillary Clinton was shopping around for White House drapes and the popular wisdom was that she was inevitable That was fun. Wasnt it. Now she hit an unfavorability rating high of 60 percent. Thats higher than Trump. It also means that the candidate who claims shes going to bring Americans together is disliked by most of the country . Clinton is seen unfavorably by 60 percent of likely voters in the latest results, a new high. Trump is seen unfavorably by essentially as many  58 percent. Marking the depth of these views, 49 percent see Clinton strongly unfavorably, and 48 percent say the same about Trump  unusual levels of strong sentiment. The extent of partisan antipathy in this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates, is remarkable Ninetyseven percent of Trump supporters see Clinton unfavorably 90 percent, strongly so. Ninetyfive percent of Clinton supporters see Trump unfavorably  again, 90 percent strongly so. But remember Hillary is inevitable. Now the Clinton campaign has decided to go after the FBI under the assumption that people like Hillary more than the FBI. That may be a slight misjudgment. And by slight, I mean huge. Because not only is the FBI more popular than Hillary, so are major landfills, UFO cattle mutilations and a number of international war criminals.",hate
"DNC Head Leaked 2nd Debate Question to Hillary October 31,   Were not talking about Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the exmuppet in charge of the DNC who was forced to resign because of the way the DNC rigged the process to favor Hillary. This is Donna Brazile who was brought in to replace her to bring back integrity to the DNC. Since Brazile is another Clinton loyalist, that was never going to happen. But the latest leak reveals that Brazile had passed along a second debate question to Hillary. All this just emphasizes how fraudulent and rigged the whole debate process was. Another leaked email has emerged showing Democratic National Committee boss and former CNN contributor Donna Brazile sharing a debate question in advance with the Hillary Clinton campaign  despite Braziles persistent claims to the contrary. CNN announced in a statement soon after the email became public Monday that Brazile had tendered her resignation and the network accepted it on Oct. 14, days after the controversy over Brazile tipping off the Clinton campaign initially broke. According to documents released Monday by WikiLeaks, Brazile sent Clinton Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri an email titled, One of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash, the night before the March 6 CNN primary debate in Flint, Mich. Her family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint, Brazile wrote. The following night, LeeAnne Walters, a mom whose twin boys stopped growing and whose daughter lost her hair during the Flint water contamination crisis, posed a question to both Clinton, the eventual Democratic presidential nominee, and her primary opponent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Clinton responded with a lengthy answer that moderator Anderson Cooper had to twice interrupt in an attempt to keep to the agreedupon time limit.

"Independents Tilt Decisively to Trump October 31, 2016 Daniel Greenfield Independents are the largest political group in the country. Larger than either Democrats or Republicans. And theyre tilting toward Trump and the GOP. Adding in ideology, the tracking poll shows Clinton going from 95 percent support among liberal Democrats early in the tracking poll to 88 percent now, while Trumps gone from 89 percent among conservative Republicans to 94 percent now. Independents  sometimes swing voters in past elections, albeit inconsistently  also merit attention. Theyve gone from a scant 6 points in Clintons favor in the first four nights of tracking, 4438 percent, to a substantial Trump lead now, 3451 percent, ClintonTrump. A key element here is the partisan preferences of independents who emerge as likely to vote They were 2 points more likely to lean toward the Republican Party rather than the Democratic Party at the start of tracking, but are 10 points more apt to do so now. Hillary Clinton tried to win over independents by positioning her brand as a moderate centrist who can work with Republicans and can get things done while portraying Trump as dangerous and irresponsible. It certainly worked to a degree. Trumps pitch was that hes not a conventional Republican and he can overturn a rigged system. The drain the swamp speech was a key element. The latter is more likely to ultimately appeal to people who identify as none of the above because theyre disgusted with both parties.",hate
"Hillary Clinton Campaign Still Whining About the FBI November 1, 2016 The Hillary Clinton whineaton continues. After having mobilized mulltiple exofficials and media types to attack the FBI, the Clinton campaign, whose candidate blatantly benefited from white glove from the FBI is complaining about a double standard. Hillary Clintons campaign accused FBI Director James Comey Monday of engaging in a blatant double standard. Clintons campaign manager Robby Mook slammed Comey in the wake of reports that the FBI director refused to publicly comment on potential Donald Trump campaign ties to Russias alleged efforts to meddle with the U.S. election, but did weigh in on an updated investigation involving Clintons email server. It is impossible to view this as anything less than a blatant double standard, Mook, Clintons campaign manager, said on a call with reporters. That Director Comey would show more discretion in a matter concerning a foreign state action than one involving the Democratic nominee for president is nothing short of jawdropping. Yes, its jaw dropping that Mook cant grasp how investigations work. Comey had no reason to comment on the Trump thing because it wasnt part of an existing criminal investigation of Trump. There has been, despite Hillarys bottomless barrel of lies, a criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton. Its a double standard if Trump and Clinton were both facing criminal investigations. Its not a double standard since only Hillary is.",hate
"The renewed criminal investigation into Hillarys misdeeds  and how it could affect the election. November 1, 2016 Matthew Vadum Democrats are in panic mode a week out from Election Day as they try to spin away the FBIs newly announced discovery of a hoard of twothirds of a million potentially sensitive emails apparently related to Hillary Clintons catastrophic tenure as Americas top diplomat. Partisan hack James Carville is spewing wild conspiracy theories. I think it is an outrage and I think the fact that the KGB is involved in this election is an outrage and I think the American people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for FBI Director James Comey. Thats what I think. He added, this is in effect an attempt to hijack an election. It ought to be called for what it is. Just this past July, Comey was praised by Democrats far and wide for his wisdom in opting not to pursue Clinton. There is evidence federal officials tried to hinder various investigations of Clinton and the endlessly corrupt Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, which functions as a bribe processing center for wouldbe president Hillary Clinton. But Democrats have suddenly flipped sides, denouncing Comey as an enemy of the republic now that he has opened an investigation into the newly discovered emails. Carville, long known as the Ragin Cajun, is apoplectic because he thinks these emails could change the dynamics of the election. The old Clinton hand may be right. Investigators found 650,000 emails on a laptop computer they believe was used at home by disgraced former Rep. Anthony Weiner D and his wife, longtime senior Hillary aide Huma Abedin. The computer is reportedly the same device serial pervert Weiner used to send sexual messages to an underage girl. Underlying metadata suggests thousands of those messages could have been sent to or from the private server that Mrs. Clinton used while she was secretary of state, according to people familiar with the matter, reports the Wall Street Journal . Some of the information emailed may have been classified. Abedin, who has intergenerational ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, reportedly forwarded sensitive government information to her personal Yahoo email account and may have viewed them on her home laptop. Over the objections of Attorney General Loretta Lynch, Comey notified Congress of the information about the previously unknown emails at this late stage in the election cycle because after letting Hillary off the hook this summer he was facing a huge uprising among FBI employees, the overwhelming majority of whom are not unprincipled supplicants to power. Lynch is doing her best to make sure the Department of Justice probe goes nowhere. Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs Peter J. Kadzik, whom Zero Hedge calls the best friend of John Podesta, Hillarys campaign chairman and former White House chief of staff in Bill Clintons administration, is heading up the email probe. So the fix is in. In any event, the prospect of restoring his good name may also have prompted Comey to act. People are upset at Comey because he took the cowards way out in the email investigation and is viewed as helping the Clinton team and the Obama White House in their efforts to cover up wrongdoing. It was back on July 5 Comey announced that despite the massive body of damning evidence accumulating against Clinton he would not recommend charges be brought against the former secretary of state for her use of hackerfriendly homebrew private email servers to conduct official business. Clinton and her aides were extremely careless in their handling of classified documents but there was no evidence of criminal intent, he said, even though the relevant national security statute does not require intent. The next day Attorney General Lynch confirmed no charges would be laid against Hillary. Lynch, as everyone now knows, had a clandestine meeting with former President Bill Clinton at a Phoenix airport a week before, at which a corrupt bargain was presumably made. This internal rebellion in the investigative agency was serious enough that Comey felt he had to act immediately. I have some sources in the FBI and the former district attorneys, commentator Larry Kudlow said Sunday on NBCs Meet the Press. The FBI is in full revolt right now. The FBI has been in full revolt since the decisions made last summer. Ever the Hillary shill, host Chuck Todd corrected Kudlow. Not full revolt, he said. Theres been a lot. I mean itsthere are agentsLets not say full revolt. All right, a semifull revolt, said Kudlow. Because what Im getting at is if Comey hadnt said what he said to Congress and the rest of the world, it would have leaked. It would have leaked. That whole building was ready to leak that they had discovered this new source with Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin. So, I dont think Comey had much chance here. And I think the FBI is badly divided. Meanwhile, the trickle of bad news for Hillary Clinton has turned into a raging flood in the last few days. Clinton has been directly implicated in a nasty false flag operation against the Donald Trump campaign. Top Democrat operatives Robert Creamer and Scott Foval were caught on undercover video describing their involvement in an elaborate criminal conspiracy involving the use of targeted political violence against political opponents. The euphemism employed was conflict engagement which means paying leftist agitators, the homeless and the mentally ill, to cause melees at Trump rallies. Fomenting violence and physically attacking political opponents was what the fascist Third Reich did, using the Sturmabteilung or S.A., also called brown shirts and storm troopers. Longtime Democrat pollster and campaign consultant Doug Schoen, a familiar face on Fox News Channel, announced he could no longer in good conscience support Clintons candidacy. Im deeply concerned that well have a constitutional crisis if shes elected, he said Sunday. If the secretary of state wins, we will have a president under criminal investigation, with top aide Huma Abedin under criminal investigation. Republican Donald Trump is closing the gap in national polls of likely voters. Clintons unfavorability rating in polls now exceeds Trumps. Shes at 60 percent hes at 58 percent. Former New York mayor and leading Trump surrogate Rudy Giuliani said over the weekend that enough evidence has surfaced from WikiLeaks and the FBI to indict Clinton for racketeering. Bill Clinton does the speeches, they put the money in the pocket, she does the favors in the government, said Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor. It all links up. Why did they destroy 33,000 emails Because it shows the link. Influential liberal journalist Ron Fournier threw Hillary under the bus. Mrs. Clinton got a secret server to protect what the Washington Post called the circle of enrichment, he said. If Hillary Clinton wins next week, media outlets across America will have to hire extra investigative journalists to handle all the corruption exposes that will follow.",hate
"How the #NeverTrumpers sunk themselves. November 1, 2016 Bruce Thornton is a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center. The chorus of NeverTrumpers is wailing ever louder as election day and Hillarys supposed victory approach. After more than a year of complaining about Trump crashing their political soiree, the Republicans attacking Trump still dont seem to get how their own behavior contributed to the perception that they are outoftouch elites disdainful of the Republican masses. A recent example comes from premier NeverTrumper Bret Stephens of the Wall Street Journal . In his column Stephens bids farewell to a Republican Party stupid enough to nominate Trump, contrasting it with his imagined Golden Age of Republican policy excellence that Trump and his followers have destroyed. One policy in particular, immigration, reveals the distance between the political and pundit elite and the voting masses that helped make Trump the nominee At a 1980 Republican primary debate in Houston, candidates George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan were asked whether the children of illegal immigrants should be allowed to attend public schools for free. Mr. Bush said they should. Were creating a whole society of really honorable, decent, familyloving people that are in violation of the law, he lamented. Reagan agreed. Instead of putting up a fence, he asked, why dont we . . . make it possible for them to come here legally with a work permit, and then, while theyre working and earning here, they pay taxes here. For good measure, Reagan suggested we should open the border both ways. Where, in the populist fervor to build a wall with Mexico and deport millions of human beings, is that Republican Party today Take Bush seniors statement first. It repeats basically the same clichs that the bipartisan Gang of Eight recycled in 2013 during their push for Comprehensive Immigration Reform, another euphemism for amnesty. All those hardworking, familyvalues illegal immigrants are embryonic conservatives, we were told, who just need legal status and social recognition so they can come out of the shadows, as John McCain said, and start voting Republican. The political apple doesnt fall far from the tree son Jeb ended his presidential ambitions by calling illegal immigration an act of love. This stance on illegal immigration by Republican politicos and pundits is obviously lightyears from the experience and position of many ordinary people. Take McCains oftrepeated trope of living in the shadows. Seriously Illegal alien young people openly protest on live television, knowing they are not going to be deported. Millions visit emergency rooms for free, and wrangle food stamps, welfare transfers, school lunches, and all sorts of largess, all the while they live protected by sanctuary cities. And living in the shadows doesnt deter them from committing felonies, given that even if caught, convicted, and deported, theyll soon be back. Remember Juan Francisco LopezSanchez, the illegal alien deported five times, who murdered Kate Steinle Or Angel Gilberto GarciaAvalos, another fivetime deportee who just this month started a 61 million fire in Sequoia National Park He had just been released from the Kern County Jail, but could not be deported because of Californias lunatic sanctuary city law, which prohibits a sheriff from contacting federal agents. Simply repeating the hardworking, family values, religious mantra doesnt address the problems of illegal immigration. There are such illegal immigrants, as I know from over sixty years of personal experience living in the San Joaquin Valley, one of the largest concentrations of illegal aliens in the country. I grew up with MexicanAmericans, theyre members of my immediate family, theyre my friends, students, and colleagues. Theyre also the victims of the crimes and disorder caused by our porous border. Some illegals do transition into these sort of immigrants, but many do not. A rigorous vetting process might sort out the wheat from the chaff. But Bush, McCain, and Stephens have not proposed a workable, rigorous mechanism for determining who should stay and who should go. That means with any form of amnesty, citizenship will likely be granted indiscriminately, with only the most egregious felons sifted out, if any are stupid enough to apply for citizenship rather than continuing to live in the shadows. But all those guilty of DUIs, hitandruns, or defrauding the welfare system with fake IDs will stayand then bring their extended families under the provisions of the disastrous 1965 Immigration Act, which enshrined family reunification, with no limits on relatives of U.S. citizens. Equally tonedeaf is Stephenss bringing up Ronald Reagans open the border both ways. Thats exactly what he did in 1986 when he signed the SimpsonMazzoli Act, which granted amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants, with promises of border enforcement that never materialized. Stephens doesnt mention that as a result, the number of illegal immigrants increased from about 3 million to 11 million, creating todays crisis. The obvious lesson is secure the border first, then figure out what to do with the 11 million. It would be governmental malfeasance to repeat Reagans mistake. The problem with politicians and pundits like Stephens is they dont live with the consequences of indiscriminately letting in people from very different cultures and mores. People like Stephens dont live daily with the disorder and crime that results. Theyre not aware of the extensive damage to quality of life, the illegal immigration version of broken windows, such as dogs without rabies shots running free, health and safety codes ignored, building codes shrugged off, garbage and refuse dumped everywhere, copper wire stolen from pumps and street lights, and chronic petty theftand thats on top of stolen cars, hitandruns, driving without insurance, gangbanging, and dealing drugs. And if Mr. Stephens thinks Im just a nativist or xenophobe or racist, I dare him to visit the San Joaquin Valley. Better yet, let him bring his wife and children to live there for a month. Come and tour a hospital emergency room, a Social Security disability office, a public school, a county jail, and then wax lyrical about these honorable, decent, familyloving people. It would take just a week for Mr. Stephens to develop a fervor for a fivefoot high wall around his house, and buy four or five pit bulls and a shotgun. Then again, he wouldnt last that long. Within a day hed scurry back to his nice, white, secure tony neighborhood where he doesnt have to pay the cost of his moral preening. And that hypocrisy is where Trump came from. In the perception of millions of votersperceptions NeverTrumpers have fed so incessantly that they look a lot like realitythe conservative politicians and pundits care more about their privileged status and purity of principle than they do about the welfare and interests of their partys voters. And so they would rather see a venal, perjurious, corrupt mediocrity become Obama 2.0 and continue the progressive destruction of the Constitutional order, than see elected the nominee of their own party. What sort of principle is that",hate
"Obama Wont Vote With America at the UN Under Obama, the United States wont defend the United States. November 1, 2016 Daniel Greenfield Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. A generation ago the Communist tyranny in Cuba demanded that the United Nations condemn America for the embargo. The brutal Castro regimes rant accused the United States of threatening nuclear annihilation, countless acts of sabotage and plans to assassinate Cuban leaders. On a cold day in October, the European leftwing activist serving as UN Ambassador announced to applause that her administration would no longer be voting to defend the US at the UN. UN Member States have voted overwhelmingly for a General Assembly resolution that condemns the U.S. embargo and calls for it to be ended. The United States has always voted against this resolution. Today the United States will abstain, Samantha Power said. Thank you, she added, acknowledging the applause. Under Obama, the United States would no longer defend the United States. A generation ago the Communists had been in Cuba. Now they were in Washington D.C. Instead of defending America, Obamas chosen representative agreed that our Communist enemies had a point about our lack of human rights and our imperialist foreign policy. Let me be among the first to acknowledge  as our Cuban counterparts often point out  that the United States has work to do in fulfilling these rights for our own citizens. And we know that at times in our history, U.S. leaders and citizens used the pretext of promoting democracy and human rights in the region to justify actions that have left a deep legacy of mistrust, she said. If the Cuban representative had been in her place, he could not have done much better. Communist Cuban propaganda was now being parroted by Ambassador Power. If the Castro dictatorship wanted to save money, it could shut down its propaganda department and outsource the labor to Washington D.C. The Cuban ambassador boasted that Cuban Communists had rid ourselves of US imperialism and proclaimed that, We will never go back to capitalism. He declared that the resolution was a powerful message to the peoples of the world. The message is indeed unmistakable. Ben Rhodes, the close Obama adviser who sold the media on the Iran sellout, curtly tweeted his justification, No reason to vote to defend a failed policy we oppose. Who is this we The Cuban embargo is the law of the land. Its the official policy of the United States. Its based on laws passed by Congress and implemented by President John F. Kennedy and his successors. This we certainly isnt the United States government, its elected representatives in the legislative and executive branches working together to end the old policy and implement a new one. One member of the we must be Ben Rhodes because he tells us so. Who is Rhodes An aspiring novelist who pushed Obama to back the Muslim Brotherhood takeover of Egypt, the Iran nuke sellout and now, apparently, choosing Communist Cuba over America. No one has ever elected Rhodes to anything, but under leftwing rule, he outweighs Congress, President Kennedy, the law of the land and the national interests of the United States. We is Obama who made the final decision. Its Ambassador Samantha Power. Its a number of other functionaries all of whom derive their power from a single elected official who is only one third of the government. This is the we that announced its treasonous opposition to the US at the UN. America has a we problem. If the we of the American left wants to vote its own way, it should secede to form its own country. When President John F. Kennedy proclaimed the Embargo on All Trade with Cuba, he based it on authorization from the Congress of the United States. That is how our system used to work. These days El Teleprompte in D.C. decides that he wants to sign a nuclear treaty with Iran, mandate transgender bathrooms, legalize millions of illegal aliens or open relations with his brother tyrant in Havana and he does so on his own authority. And Congress is dismissed as a bunch of obstructionists. Thats not how America is supposed to work. Thats how Iran works. Thats how Cuba works. The first word in the introduction to Obamas Presidential Policy Directive on Cuba after the date was I. Obamas basis for his authority is his 2014 announcement. Letat cest moi. Obama is the State. JFK, no humble shrinking violet, mentions I only in the fourth paragraph, after Congress. What is the context of Kennedys I Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority of section 620a of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The I of JFK can only act as a servant, not a master. In Obamas Directive, Congress exists only to be berated or badgered for its obstructionism. There is no source of authorization for anything other than Barack Obama. There is no law. Only Obama. Now the big we in Washington have decided that they will oppose America at the United Nations. But Ben Rhodes, who aspires to excel at novelistic narratives, made an unfortunate slip. Obama has been accused of Louis XIVs Letat cest moi mentality. But Ben Rhodes isnt saying, We are the state. Instead he tells us that there are two powerful political entities in America. One is US. The other is We. We does not yet entirely control the state. But we also feels no obligation to the United States. If we agrees with America, then we will vote with it at the UN. If we opposes America, then we votes against it. We will choose patriotism or treason based on its own interests. Not ours. We happens to run America. But it isnt America. Its the parasite humped on Americas back. You can call we by many names. Deep State is one. Its a coalition of leftwing special interests networking through politics, the nonprofit sector and media corporations to control America. President Kennedy was quite familiar with the enemy . We are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influenceon infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice. Kennedy was speaking after the recent Bay of Pigs crisis. The Foreign Assistance Act, mentioned by him, was passed by Congress that year. While the Cuban embargo limited the ability of the Castro regime to sponsor and spread terror around the region and the world, it didnt stop the we in Washington D.C. It is easy to sit here in the distant future of 2016 and wonder whether Cuba matters at all. But the truth is that we are still enmeshed in the same fundamental struggle of the Cold War. That struggle did not end when the Berlin Wall fell. It is a battle over whether nations will be ruled by We the People or by the nameless We of the monolithic and ruthless conspiracy of the Nomenklatura of the left. By backing away from America at the United Nations, the we have announced their independence from the laws, responsibilities and duties of the country whose government they have hijacked. But the we offer us no such independence from their treasonous rule. Instead they impose on us the collectivism of Yevgeny Zamyatins novel We in which everyone suffers under the stifling progressive tyranny of the One State that controls every aspect of human life. That novel inspired 1984. What we offer us is what Cubas Castro, Wes One State and every Communist regime offer us. Its what George Orwell in 1984 summed up as, A boot stamping on a human face  forever. President Kennedy dated his embargo proclamation from the one hundred and eightysixth year of the Independence of the United States of America. At the United Nations, Ambassador Power cheerfully declared Americas enforced submission to the Communist demands for Cuba. The Cuban people show no signs of winning independence from their Communist overlords. The question is will the United States of America be able to regain its independence from the we",hate
"Dawn Perlmutter The war on law enforcement is epidemic. Every aspect of culture has been infected. The antipolice disease is highly contagious and rapidly spreading on social media, in memes, in movements, in popular fast food restaurants, at football games, on campuses, in media and in every aspect of American culture. An epidemic is defined as the rapid spread of infectious disease to a large number of people in a given population within a short period of time. Colin Kaepernick is the Typhoid Mary of the antipolice epidemic. Kaepernick refuses to stand while the U.S. national anthem is being performed at the start of NFL games as a protest against alleged racial injustice and police brutality. On Sept. 1 Kaepernick chose to kneel on one knee as his protest gesture instead of just sitting on the bench. His explanation for his decision to switch is that it was an attempt to show more respect to former and current U.S. military members. As if kneeling is somehow symbolically less offensive than sitting. He misinterpreted the meaning of the military expression, take a knee which occurs when troops take a pause before continuing their mission. Similar to Hands Up Dont Shoot the antipolice gesture has been imbued with a trendy righteousness regardless of its original meaning. The media reverently refers to Kaepernicks protest as Taking a Knee as if it is some kind of sacred act. There are no headlines that read Kaepernick Disses the Flag or Kaepernick Takes a Crap on his Country. Just in case his gesture didnt send a clear enough message, Kaepernick also uses clothing to symbolize his antipolice sympathies. He has worn everything from tshirts honoring the militant Black Panther Party to socks that depict police as pigs. In addition to numerous other crimes the Black Panther Party was responsible for the murder of at least 15 officers and originated the expression Off the Pigs meaning murder police. Like the typhoid infected cook Mary Mallon, Kaepernick is rapidly spreading the antipolice pathogen. In what has been dubbed the Kaepernick Effect dozens of NFL and WNBA players have knelt, sat, or raised a fist during the national anthem. The disease has also spread to over 50 high schools, 35 colleges, and one middle school. In what can only be described as a bizarre symbolic contradiction there were two incidents where women performing the Star Spangled Banner got down on one knee in protest of what they were singing. One of the women, Denasia Lawrence, not only kneeled while performing the anthem but also opened her jacket to display a Black Lives Matter tshirt exposing Miami Heat fans to the contagious disorder. Rapid spread is well known for infectious diseases. The antipolice disorder also contaminated the Navy. An unidentified sailor assigned to the Naval Air Technical Training Center in Pensacola, Florida, filmed herself deliberately not standing for the National Anthem and posted it on Facebook. She remained seated and raised a fist during morning colors and then praised Colin Kaepernick. Another sailor Petty Officer 2nd Class Janaye Ervin, an intelligence specialist in the Navy Reserve, stationed at Pearl Harbor, did not stand for the national anthem while in uniform. She also posted a statement on Facebook saying she was inspired by Colin Kaepernick. The Navy acted decisively. She lost her security clearance and may be facing jail in response to her actions. It is yet to be known if facing real consequences will contribute to curing the virus or accelerating it. Kaepernick is just one carrier of the antipolice disease. The source of the infection can be attributed to specific movements such as Black Lives Matter that originated in Florida during the Trayvon Martin protests. The disease went airborne in Ferguson, Missouri where it was transmitted to college students, professional protesters and journalists who subsequently spread the disorder to towns and cities across the country. Currently the disease seems to cluster around populations that are susceptible to antipolice propaganda. The symptoms are irrationality, excessive anger, impaired perception, anxiety, hatred and delusions of oppression. Acute symptoms include sudden changes in behavior, aggression, paranoia, loss of control and homicidal and suicidal tendencies. All indicators are expressed in severe disrespect for law and order. Early symptoms of the antipolice epidemic have been observed in various cultural manifestations of contempt for law enforcement officers. Antipolice graffiti is a common symptom of the virus. Writing has escalated from insults such as police are murderers to threats of violence. A recent popular indicator is the expression Kill Cops and related variations such as Kill All Police, Save A Life, Kill a Cop, Cops Lives Dont Matter and Shoot Cops. Threats are also depicted in images such as guns to officers heads. Violent antipolice rhetoric has also been seen in protest signs that read All My Heroes Kill Cops, Put Wings on Pigs Kill Cops and Cops Under Control Or Cops Under Flowers. Disturbingly, antipolice graffiti, protests and tweets increase after officers are murdered signifying that violence against cops is celebrated and glorified. The antipolice epidemic has also spread to wellknown fast food restaurants. Employees have refused to serve officers at a Taco Bell in Phenix City, AL Dunkin Donuts in West Hartford, CT Krispy Kreme in Columbia, SC IHOP in Virginia Beach, VA Arbys in Pembroke Pines, FL Chuck E. Cheese in Bowling Green, KY Whataburger in Lewisville, TX McDonalds in Brenham, TX Chipotle in Brooklyn, NY Genghis Grill in Dallas, TX Noodles  Company, in Alexandria, VA Tropical Smoothie in Winter Haven, FL Luckys Teriyaki, SedroWoolley, WA and at the Krystal Restaurant in Irondale, AL. Other incidents involved employees refusing to let an officer use the restroom in a Philadelphia Starbucks, refusing service at a Sunoco gas station in Miramar, FL, writing Black Lives Matter on an officers coffee cup at a Dunkin Donuts in Providence, RI and a Walmart Bakery in McDonough, GA refusing to bake a cake for a police officers retirement party. These are just the incidents that have been made public. Refusing service at a restaurant goes beyond gestures of disrespect. Law Enforcement officers are concerned that instead of simply being denied service that their food will be tampered with. For this reason, many officers will only eat at restaurants where they can see the food being made. This is a legitimate concern. On Aug 23, 2016 in Louisville, KY five police officers were denied service at a Taco Bell. When another employee took their orders, they overheard a conversation between two employees making the food saying, Im going to mess with them, which resulted in them walking out of the restaurant. When officers have to fear what is being put in their food there can be no doubt that the war on police is a fullscale epidemic. The antipolice infection went viral on social media. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other social networks have hundreds of antipolice pages ridiculing, disrespecting and threatening officers. Protests and riots are organized on social media and some users openly advocate and celebrate the killing of police officers. The following are examples of popular hashtags #FTP Fuck The Police, #BlueLivesMurder, #ACAB All Cops Are Bastards, #BlueLivesDontMatter, #FuckCops, #FuckThemAll, #APDK All Police Dept. Killer, #FryEmLikeBacon, #BlackLivesMatter, #Ferguson, #MilwaukeeUprising and #Kaepernick. As the disease progresses, more acute symptoms begin to manifest in acts of violence. A particularly offensive indicator of the disorder is the desecration of fallen officer memorials. Memorials honoring officers killed in the line of duty have been attacked in Philadelphia, Chicago, Albuquerque, Fresno, Denver, New Orleans, Oakland, Austin, Honolulu, Rochester, San Diego, St. Paul, Covington, Richmond, Goshen, Fayetteville, Raleigh and many other cities across the country. Vandalism has involved everything from dousing in paint, toppling and scratching granite, burning, to destroying a metal torch in order to extinguish the eternal flame. In a previous article , I described these acts as symbolic assassinations. Vandals target tributes to heroic officers because they want to appropriate the valor, honor and respect that they think they have been deprived of. This is another symptom of the antipolice disease. A sense of entitlement and resentment that leads to both symbolic and actual attacks on law enforcement officers. At its most critical stage the antipolice disorder is lethal. This is expressed in the dozens of ambushes and killings of police officers. In the most acute phase of the disease some of those infected become homicidal and suicidal targeting and killing officers knowing that they will die in the incident. A pattern has emerged that clearly demonstrates that attacks on police escalate from protest gestures to acts of vandalism to deadly shootings that inspire further demonstrations in a continual cycle of protest and violence. Consequently, Kaepernicks gesture is neither benign nor harmless. It is one symptom in a deadly epidemic.",hate
"Force and Fanaticism  Wahhabism in Saudi Arabia and Beyond Is Wahhabism a complete distortion of Islam November 1, 2016 Raymond Ibrahim Note In what follows, Shillman Fellow Raymond Ibrahim reviews Force and Fanaticism Wahhabism in Saudi Arabia and Beyond, by Simon Ross Valentine. A shorter version of the book review first appeared in the Middle East Quarterly Fall, 2016, vol. 23, no. 4. Valentine, a British Methodist pastor and teacher who taught in Saudi Arabia, has written a useful book about the desert kingdom. Most interesting is its exploration of how the monarchy is the single greatest force in spreading Islamic fundamentalism it has spent as much as 100 billion to spread Wahhabism in the West, yet America and Britain have been, and are continuing to be, implicit supporters of Wahhabism. Valentine discusses the background of how this unholy alliance came about. He warns If the West simply ignores it, Saudi Arabias role in international terrorism seems likely to worsen rather than conveniently disappear. This is troubling considering that ISIS is Saudi Arabias latest monstrous contribution to world history. The author explores important topics, including the mutawwa , or religious police, and provides useful historical context, discussing the origins of Wahhabism, its alliance with the House of Saud, and the oil discoveries that changed everything. The books primary defect is standard. Valentine regularly insists that it is of the greatest importance to distinguish between Wahhabism and Islam generally. Anything good, positive, tolerant and peaceful is ascribed to Islam anything bad, negative, intolerant, and violentmisogyny, draconian punishments, execution of apostates, intolerance for and discrimination against nonMuslimsis ascribed to Wahhabism. This position appears to be based on the authors own cultural presuppositions. Thus he felt confused and puzzled to hear of Wahhabi intolerance, including the attempt to propagate their beliefs by force, prompting him to wonder Can you force someone to love God.... In all the conversations I had with ulema, imams, Mutawa religious police and Saudis generally there was never a mention of love, the idea that God loved me, just frightful talk of hell, burning and future pain if I did not believe and accept the Wahhabi faith. Had Valentine engaged in a critical reading of Islamic doctrine and historyas opposed to projecting his Christian notion of God onto Islamhe wouldve known that Muhammad, followed by countless caliphs and sultans throughout the centuries, did propagate their beliefs by force the overwhelming majority of todays Muslim world was taken from nonMuslims by force and that although Islam attributes 99 characteristics to God, love is not one of them. Valentines readers wouldve benefit much more had he simply laid out his useful information concerning the inner workings of the Saudi regime and its unholy alliance with the West, without trying to tackle the deeper question of what Islam really isleading to yet another book marred by Islamic apologetics.",hate
"If government can truly alleviate poverty, why have leftist policies only made it worse November 1, 2016 Thomas Sowell The political left keeps announcing, as if it is a new breakthrough discovery of theirs, that life is unfair. Have they never read Thomas Grays Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard, more than two and a half centuries ago What about economic historian David S. Landes statement The world has never been a level playing field In the joint autobiography of Milton Friedman and his wife Rose, they say Everywhere in the world there are gross inequities of income and wealth. They offend most of us. Few can fail to be moved by the contrast between the luxury enjoyed by some and the grinding poverty suffered by others. Moreover, Professor Friedman left behind a foundation dedicated to promoting school choice, so that disadvantaged children could get a better education for a better chance in life. What is it that the political left is saying that they think is so new, such a breakthrough and such a necessity for progress More important, what test of evidence  if any  have they ever subjected their notions to No one has presented the social vision of the left more often than Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times  and no one has been more certain that those who do not happen to share his vision just dont get it, as he has repeatedly declared. Mr. Kristofs essay Growing Up Poor in America in the October 30th New York Times is a classic example of the mindset of the left. It begins with the story of a poor black teenager in Arkansas, being raised by a single mom. Sometimes he goes hungry and his home does not have even one book. But it does have television sets with huge screens, and apparently there is money enough to buy marijuana. Surely we can all agree that this young fellow has very unpromising future prospects ahead of him, and that this is a human tragedy. The circumstances of his life are unfair to him and none of us would want to be born into such circumstances. Moreover, he is just one of many who are brought up in a setting that is full of dangers and with a low probability of improvement. But that is not enough for Mr. Kristof or for the political left in general. Of such youngsters he says, as a society, we fail them long before they fail us. Whoa Just when did society make the decisions and engage in the actions that have led to this teenager being in the bad situation he is in And just when did society acquire either the omniscience or the omnipotence to prevent it When the left says society they usually mean government. That is apparently what society means in this case, for Kristof laments that this teenager is the kind of person whom Americas presidential candidates just dont talk about. If the left chooses to believe that government intervention is the answer to such tragedies, that is their right. But, if they expect the rest of us to share that belief, surely they could subject that belief to some empirical test. But we can, however. The 1960s were the triumphant decade of those who wanted government intervention to solve what they called social problems. How did that work out What were things like before this social vision triumphed And what were things like afterwards Homicide victimization rates among black males were going down substantially in the 1940s and the 1950s. But homicide victimization rates reversed and skyrocketed in the 1960s, wiping out all the progress of the two previous decades. When the 1960s began, most black children were born into families with both a mother and a father. After the great welfare state expansion during the 1960s, most black children were born to a single mother, like the youngster in Arkansas today. Kristofs essay also mentions a teenage girl who is a single mother, and suggests that sex education could have prevented her from getting pregnant. Teenage pregnancy was going down  repeat, DOWN  during the 1950s. It reversed and shot up after the 1960s began bringing the sex education vision into schools across the country. Very similar trends occurred in England, after very similar visions and policies also triumphed there in the 1960s. Perhaps it is the left that just doesnt get it  or cannot face the hard fact that its own vision and policies worsened the very things they claimed would be made better.",hate
"Time Investigating Hillary is an Attack on All Women November 1, 2016 Good morning. Its Tuesday. Whos up for another silly attempt to claim that Hillary Clinton is only being investigated for her rogue email setup because shes a woman This gem comes from Robin Lakoff, a Berkeley professor in sustained incoherence and special pleading. Hillary Clintons Emailgate Is an Attack on Women Its not about emails its about public communication by a woman I am mad. I am mad because I am scared. And if you are a woman, you should be, too. Emailgate is a bitch hunt, but the target is not Hillary Clinton. Its us. The only reason the whole email flap has legs is because the candidate is female. Can you imagine this happening to a man His name was General Petraeus. Thank you. Have a nice day. Clinton is guilty of SWF Speaking While Female, and emailgate is just a reminder to us all that she has no business doing what shes doing and must be punished, for the sake of all decent women everywhere. There is so much of that going around. That escalated quickly. And incoherently. Also Im pretty sure its not the 20s or whatever decade Robin is parodying or channeling. But yes, Hillary Clinton is only in this mess because shes a woman. It has nothing to do with anything else. That must be why Albright and Rice werent in the center of similar scandals. If the candidate were male, there would be no scolding and no scandal. Those very ideas would be absurd. Men have a nearly absolute right to freedom of speech. In theory, so do women, but that, as the creationists like to say, is only a theory. Emailing classified information on your server to avoid transparency regulations is not free speech. Its illegal for both public officials of both genders. But heres Hillary Rodham Clinton, the very public standin for all bossy, uppity and ambitious women. Here are her emails.

"Hillary Campaign Manager Gets 7K a Month from Hillary Donor Linked to Economic Collapse   Clintonworld is a giant sewer. Nothing about it can surprise. It plummets to infinite depths of slime, mold and rotting carrion. This is just another day in Clintonworld . John Podesta, who draws no salary from the campaign, is making 7,000 per month from the Sandler Foundation, run by Herb Sandler, Politico reported. The Sandlers ran World Savings Bank, which was sold to Wachovia in 2006 for 25.5 billion and which was accused of offering adjustablerate mortgages that contributed to the housing collapse. Saturday Night Live got into trouble when it depicted the Sandlers as people who should be shot. Time Magazine listed them as one of 25 people to blame for the financial crisis. In the early 1980s, the Sandlers World Savings Bank became the first to sell a tricky home loan called the option ARM. And they pushed the mortgage, which offered several ways to backload your loan and thereby reduce your early payments, with increasing zeal and misleading advertisements over the next two decades. The couple pocketed 2.3 billion when they sold their bank to Wachovia in 2006. But losses on World Savings loan portfolio led to the implosion of Wachovia, which was sold under duress late last year to Wells Fargo. Notorious right wing comedy show Saturday Night Live also featured the Sandlers On October 4, 2008, however, Saturday Night Live aired a skit in which the Sandlers were depicted as predatory lenders. Under their names, SNL placed the caption people who should be shot. Compounding the Sandlers negative press was a Time magazine list that identified them as two of the 25 people to blame for the financial crisis. The New York Times also labeled the Sandlers pariahs  and on December 24, 2008, the Times reportedthat their mortgages were the Typhoid Mary of the housing crisis.

"Lawyer Who Kept Hillary Campaign Chief Out of Jail in DOJ Hillary Probe November 1, 2016 Daniel Greenfield Peter Kadzik kept Hillarys campaign chief out of jail. And he hopes to do the same for her. Hillarys people have gone on the warpath against the FBI. Their allies are Obamas political appointees at the DOJ. And this is who is in their corner. The Justice Department official in charge of informing Congress about the newly reactivated Hillary Clinton email probe is a political appointee and former privatepractice lawyer who kept Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta out of jail, lobbied for a tax cheat later pardoned by President Bill Clinton and led the effort to confirm Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Peter Kadzik, who was confirmed as assistant attorney general for legislative affairs in June 2014, represented Podesta in 1998 when independent counsel Kenneth Starr was investigating Podesta for his possible role in helping exBill Clinton intern and mistress Monica Lewinsky land a job at the United Nations. Fantastic lawyer. Kept me out of jail, Podesta wrote on Sept. 8, 2008 to Obama aide Cassandra Butts, according to emails hacked from Podestas Gmail account and posted by WikiLeaks. Kadziks name has surfaced multiple times in regard to the FBIs investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for using a private, homebrewed server. After FBI Director James Comey informed Congress on Thursday the FBI was reviving its inquiry when new evidence linked to a separate investigation was discovered, congressional leaders wrote to the Department of Justice seeking more information. Kadzik replied. We assure you that the Department will continue to work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible, Kadzik wrote on Oct. 31. Kadzik had been an attorney with Dickstein Shapiro LLP for 18 years before he represented Podesta in the Clinton/Lewinsky investigation. He was hired in 2000 as a lobbyist for tax cheat Marc Rich, who was controversially granted a pardon by President Bill Clinton during Clintons final days in office. Kadzik got the job because he was trusted by White House Chief of Staff John Podesta, and was considered to be a useful person to convey Marc Richs arguments to Mr. Podesta, according to a 2002 House Oversight Committee report. Marc Rich Funny you should mention his name. FBI boss Comey was the prosecutor in that case. And the FBI recently released material from the investigation into that case. So theres a lot of Clinton history coming full circle here.",hate
"FBI Releases Files on Bill Clintons Cash for Pardons Scandal November 1, 2016 Daniel Greenfield The FBI has an early present for Hillary Clinton. Its the files from the time her husband decided to pardon a wanted fugitive in exchange for cash. That fugitive was a fellow by the name of Marc Rich. His prosecutor James Comey. The FBI unexpectedly released 129 pages of documents related to an investigation closed without charges in 2005 into President Bill Clintons pardon of Marc Rich, who had been married to a wealthy Democratic donor. The unusual timing of the release was the result of a Freedom of Information Act request that had been completed and was posted under standard FBI practice, according to a law enforcement official who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. But the Clinton campaign immediately questioned the timing of the release. Well of course it did. Its never especially wise to pick fights with people who have a lot of dirt on you. The investigation stemmed from one of several pardons Clinton made on the last day of his presidency in 2001, that of financier and international fugitive Marc Rich, whose exwife Denise had given to the Democratic National Committee and the entity that would later become the Clinton Foundation. And theres a surprise guest. While the files may seem dated, they invoke figures beyond the Clintons who went on to play key roles in official Washington  including Comey. He served as prosecutor in charge of a legal case against Rich from 1987 to 1993. As the U.S. attorney in Manhattan in 2002, Comey took over a criminal investigation of Clintons pardons. I was stunned at the Rich pardon, Comey wrote in a letter to lawmakers in 2008. Clintons people are fuming, but it was a standard FIOA request and theres nothing big here. Its just one of those things the Clintons should have gone to jail for. But didnt. Another of those.",hate
"Hillary Already Planning Fireworks for Victory Celebration November 1, 2016 People of the United States, your royal family . Law enforcement officials and the FDNY have been told to prepare for a bargelaunched pyrotechnic display off Manhattans Javits Center, where Clinton and running mate Tim Kaine will join their supporters for the Nov. 8 vote count, sources said. The aerial detonations would last for two minutes, with the triumphal celebration permitted to start as early as 930 p.m.  a mere halfhour after the polls close in New York, sources said. Fortunately pride has never been known to come before a fall. And hubris is a notoriously positive trait with no negative consequences. That must be why Hillary Clinton is down in the polls and facing yet another investigation while feuding with the FBI. Cops and firefighters were blown away by Clintons hubris in planning the fireworks display, which would eclipse the shower of blazing sparkles that preceded the balloon drop at Julys Democratic National Convention. Its a little presumptuous of her to plan on winning. I guess she put in for this before Friday, one NYPD detective said. Others said the actual election results could put a damper on things, but one firefighter raised the specter of a 2000style recount and added, So whats she going to do, put the fireworks on ice The arrogance is truly unchecked.",hate
"Obamas Secret Muslim List Why enemies of Israel and Irans goto guy appeared on the list. November 2, 2016 Daniel Greenfield Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. Like a warped Islamic version of Santa Claus, Obama had a secret Muslim list. And his people checked it at least twice. The list was of Muslims who were prospects for important jobs and appointments. It included a Muslim who had described Israel as an Apartheid State, Irans goto guy in New York financial circles and a number of figures linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. It was the ultimate religious test from an administration that had vocally rejected them. Obama had claimed that having religious tests for migration was shameful and not American. When I hear folks say that, well maybe we should just admit the Christians but not the Muslims, he huffed from Turkey. His Muslim host country was run by a bigoted sponsor of Islamic terror. We dont have religious tests, he insisted. Except we did and we do. Obama also had religious tests. His religious tests excluded Christians and favored Muslims. That is why his Syrian refugees were between 98 and 99 Muslim with only 68 Christians and 24 Yazidis, even though both groups are real victims of the Muslim religious war. Syria is 10 Christian and hundreds of thousands have been displaced. Yet only 68 have made it past Obamas iron curtain. Thats either an Islamic religious test or the worlds greatest coincidence. But would the man who piously lectured us on the evils of religious tests really have a religious test Of course he would. The hacked emails include a list of Muslim American candidates for top Administration jobs, subcabinet jobs, and outside boards/agencies/policy committees. The list was sent to John Podesta who headed the ObamaBiden Transition Project. It had been put together by a woman who had sat on the Commission on International Religious Freedom, but boasted that she had, Excluded those with some Arab American background but who are not Muslim e.g., George Mitchell. Many Lebanese Americans, for example, are Christian. How shameful. How not American of Barack Hussein Obama. Most who are listed appear to be MuslimAmerican, except that a handful where noted may be Arab American but of uncertain religion esp. Christian, she assured Podesta. Religious tests are only out of line when they exclude Muslims. Not when they exclude Christians. Thats the pattern which emerged from the ObamaBiden Transition Project and Obamas refugee policy. There has been a clear pattern of administration bias against Christians and Jews. And in favor of Muslims. That bias has been obvious in a foreign policy which backed Islamic supremacist groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood over more moderate governments at the expense of nonMuslim populations. This policy led to the displacement and death of countless Christians, and the persecution of entire communities, by an administration which then denied safe harbor to the victims of its own policies. Administration bias replicated that same bigoted policy at home when it favored Islamic candidates. Obama appointed Farooq Kathwari, the first name on the Muslim list sent to Podesta, to the Presidents Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The Muslim list email had warned that, Kathwaris then 19yearold Americaneducated son Irfan aka Imran, was killed in 1992 fighting Jihad against the Russians in Afghanistan. The actions of his son, who may have been with the Mujahedeen but was also apparently outraged over Indias defense of Kashmir, is of less relevance than Kathwaris appearance at an ISNA conference and another conference cosponsored by the Muslim Students Association. Both groups are linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. He cochaired the American Muslim Task Force whose members included Salam AlMarayati , Director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, which has defended Hamas and Hezbollah, Yahya Basha, president of the American Muslim Council and a former board member of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, and assorted other Islamists . Its report complained that Muslims were inhibited from donating to charities run by Islamic terrorist groups such as Hezbollah. Yahya Basha also appeared on Obamas Muslim list. Also listed was MPACs Aslam Abdullah who had claimed that Zionists, Christians and Hindus were behind the War on Terror. He had described Israel as an apartheid state and a racist state. The second Muslim on the list, Cyrus AmirMokri, was named assistant treasury secretary. He became the first Iranian to be named to such a high position and defended the Iran nuclear sellout. Mokri attended a meeting with members of the Iran Lobby at the White House. He also reportedly advised Obama on Iranian sanctions. Obama had famously told NASA boss Bolden that one of his three tasks at the space agency was Muslim selfesteem. But Bolden almost didnt make it in. The Muslim list included two alternative candidates for NASA administrator. One of them, Dr. Charles Elachi of JPL was dismissed as possibly Christian. Indeed Elachi, who grew up admiring John Wayne and believes that American success is possible because it isnt held back by the longstanding, ingrained systems and beliefs found in the Middle East would have been a rather poor fit. But it is deeply shameful and unAmerican that his potential NASA appointment questioned his religion. That is an inappropriate religious test that Obama must apologize for. The other name on the list however is Firouz Naderi, an Iranian board member of the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans which advocated in support of the Iran nuke sellout. Eboo Patel, whose name would frequently appear on lists of Islamists in the Obama administration, first made an appearance on the Muslim List. Despite his Islamist ties, he got the posting at the Advisory Council on FaithBased Neighborhood Partnerships. Also listed were Keith Ellison, Andre Carson and Larry Shaw. Shaw sits on the board of CAIR. Dilawar Syed, the first name to appear on the list of possible appointments, was named to Obamas Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Syed is a cofounder and chair of the Asian Americans and Pacific Islander Victory Fund which has come out for Hillary Clinton. The secret Muslim list describes him as animated by policy issues relating to the Muslim world. A similar description is appended to the bio for Kashif Zafar who served as a CoChair of the South Asian American Leadership Council at the DNC. Also on the list was Hamid Biglari. Bloomberg described Biglari as Irans Man in New York and as the Iranian presidents goto guy in New York financial circles. Biglari was a key Iran Lobby figure. The recently revealed secret Muslim list is deeply troubling. There should be no religious test for political appointments. Yet Obama had one. And his people sought to screen out Christians and favor Muslims. This represents behavior that is in Obamas own words, shameful and not American. One cant help but conclude that, based on his own principles, Obama is shameful and not American.",hate
"Will James Comey Change the Outcome of the Election Is this the gamechanging October surprise that many hope for  and others dread November 2, 2016 Bruce Thornton is a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center. FBI Director James Comeys reopening of the investigation into Clintons emails has roiled once more the presidential election. Donald Trump has called the decision courageous and bigger than Watergate. Clinton, the DOJ, Democrat Senators, and their media flying monkeys are all having conniption fits over their quondam champions defection, calling the announcement appalling, absurd, strange, deeply troubling, an attack, and unprecedented. The bigger question is whether it will move enough voters over to Trumps side and put him in the White House. Theres no doubt that Comeys announcement eleven days before the election is mystifying. Not because it is unprecedented as the Democrats keep squealing. They had no such qualms when the weekend before the 1992 election, special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh indicted a pollsurging George H.W. Bush for his alleged involvement in the IranContra scandal. No, the mystery is Comeys motives. Is Comey like Conrads Lord Jim, now sacrificing his FBI careersure to be over if the notoriously vengeful Clinton is elected to atone for having besmirched his office, reputation, and the principle of equality before the law in service to careerist selfinterest Or was he facing a mutiny and leaks from disgruntled FBI investigators To quote one of our candidates, At this point, what difference does it make The real question is whether it will make a difference to the voters. Right now we dont know if the content of the 650,000 emails from the conjugal laptop used by serial sexter Anthony Weiner, estranged husband of Clinton vizier Huma Abedin, will reveal something damning like, say, classified materials. But we already know that Clinton passed classified information over an unsecured server, which didnt bother Comey back in July. So what could be in these new emails that rises above Comeys sophistic extreme carelessness, and reaches the statutes gross negligence Or has Comey found new evidence of Hillarys intent, his other exculpatory sophistry that had little to do with the law There had to be something that made Comey subject himself to the scorchedearth wrath of the Democrats. Whatever is found on the Abedin laptop, one wonders if will even matter to a sufficient number of voters. They have shrugged off so many scandals, lies, and failures that should have sunk a candidacy, that its hard to calculate what level of incompetence, unpleasantness, dishonesty, sleaze, and crime is disqualifying anymore. Here are the greatest hits from Hillarys catalogue Whitewater Missing billing records from her tenure at the Rose Law Firm Renting out the Lincoln Bedroom to donors Travelgate Illegal possession of FBI files Conducting illegal secret meetings of the Task Force on National Health Care Reform Cackling over keeping a pedophile rapist out of jail Hounding the victims of her husbands sexual assaults and philandering Stealing 200,000 worth of china, furniture, and artwork from the White House Claiming she landed under sniper fire in Bosnia Claiming she and Bill left the White House dead broke Shaking down Wall Street while assuring the Orcs of capitalism that shes got their back Charging exorbitant speaking fees for a half hour of banalities and bromides Calling 30,000 missing emails personal communications Lying about the Benghazi attack to the faces of the four dead Americans families Supporting the lie that the attacks were caused by an obscure Internet video when she knew the same night that they werent Perjuring herself before Congress and the FBI about the emails and her private server The disastrous overthrow of Ghaddafi in Libya The disastrous reset with Russia The disastrous nuclear deal with Iran The disastrous withdrawal from Iraq The corrupt Clinton Foundation and its wholly owned subsidiary, the paytoplay State Department Using feminist rhetoric while taking cash from some of the planets most brutally misogynistic regimes Serially flipflopping on issues like samesex marriage, the Trans Pacific Trade deal, and the Keystone pipeline Promising to raise taxes on the middle class and put coal miners out of work Her campaign staffs dirty tricks against Trump and his supporters Her campaign staffs incestuous relationship with the media Her staffs illegal destruction of incriminating evidence during the email investigation Her strong support of gruesome lateterm abortions And, last but not least, the continuing unanswered questions about her physical and cognitive health Back in the day, just a few of these gaffes, deceptions, and failures would probably have sunk a campaign for Congress, let alone the White House. And Mr. Trumps offenses Hes talks exactly as youd expect a New York real estate developer, casino owner, reality television star, and beauty pageant mogul to talk Hes condemned as a sexual assaulter for saying a decade ago what Bill Clinton and every WhiteHousevisiting rapper, movie star, or rock star knows about the sexual perks of celebrity When youre a star they let you do it, as Trump bragged of his crude sexual advances Hes ignorant of policy He doesnt understand the economics of global trade He doesnt know what the nuclear triad is Hes addicted to a half dozen superlative adjectives He wants to build a wall with Mexico He takes legal advantage of tax law Hes not suitable for office He does not have the right temperament Hes used bankruptcy as a business tool Hes accused of groping over a dozen women, including a polymorphously perverse porn star Hes mean and insulting He has orange hair In short, Trump lacks the superficial patina of rhetorical decorum and sober demeanor that most modern presidents and candidates spray over their public personas in order to hide their private flaws and vices. Just ask Hillarys various Secret Service details how wide the distance between public and private personalities can be. The voters will decide for themselves which candidates catalogue of sins is more disqualifying and dangerous. But whatever happens, its clear that we the people have lowered the bar of acceptability for presidential candidates. This transformation happened decades before Trump and Hillary came along. After Bill Clinton was impeached for perjury related to his sordid sexual depredations in the White House, his approval ratings were 73. He left the White House with a 66 rating, higher than any president since Harry Truman, including Ronald Reagan. Think about it the president who sexually exploited an intern and was impeached for perjury left office with higher approval ratings than the president who rescued the economy and tossed the Soviet Union into its own dustbin of history. That was the inflection point for our political culture. No wonder that Barack Obamas lack of any realworld experience or achievement, leftwing views, selfconfessed drug use, friends like the antiAmerican racist Jeremiah Wright and unrepentant terrorist Bill Ayers, and gaping holes in his biography were unimportant to 45 million voters. So why now are we shocked, shocked that offbrand candidates like Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are vying for the presidency Decrying these candidates is closing the barn door after the horses of virtue, wisdom, and decorum have already long gone. So absent a smoking howitzer in the next WikiLeaks dump, Comeys restart of the investigation, which in any case will take months to complete, will probably not be the gamechanging October surprise many hope for and others dread, especially given a corrupt medias studied indifference to anything that damages their candidate. Then again, the rapid erosion of Hillarys support is drawing analogies to Reagans late surge against Carter. Either way, on November 8, most people will vote their economic interests and their ideological passions, and decide based on subjective perceptions and silly criteria like cares for people like me. Or they might just finally realize that Hillarys accumulated offenses are intolerable. But what that standard of selection will deliver is anybodys guess.",hate
"Lloyd Billingsley Presidential debates between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton included a third participant Vladimir Putin, standing in the background, stealthily inserting himself in the process. Putins Russia uses deniable cyberhooliganism to actively prank the American political system. And its taking a toll. . . This is the Putin Playbook. Steal, cheat, attack, disrupt, mislead, confuse. If caught, lie and deny. And it gets worse. Unfortunately, the Republican presidential nominee reinforces this narrative, referring to a rigged system and an indictable opponent. His outbursts follow years of domestic political discord, where comity is history, crazy seems the new normal, and a sitting president can be heckled with You lie All told, the piece reads like a Clinton press release, but its actually Putins powerful playbook Hack, steal, disrupt, mislead, confuse, in the October 30, Sacramento Bee , two days after the Comey email bombshell. The author is Markos Kounalakis, billed as a senior fellow at Central European University and visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution. That doesnt quite capture the man and his connections with the Clintons, which have shown up in Wikileaks. Mr. Kounalakis author line fails to reveal that he is married to Eleni TsakopoulosKounalakis, daughter of realestate tycoon Angelo Tsakopoulos. According to Greek USA Reporter , Angelo is a top political donor to the Clintons as well as the Democratic Party, whose donations to former President Bill Clinton were rewarded with a night in the prestigious Lincoln Bedroom. In 2013 Tsakopoulos, confirmed that Hillary Clinton will seek the Democratic nomination in the next Presidential election. Angelos daughter Eleni, a protg of Nancy Pelosi and Barbara Boxer , raised more than 1 million for Hillary Clinton in 2008 , and that money found its reward. On January 7, 2010, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton swore in TsakopoulosKounalakis as U.S. Ambassador to Hungary. In that capacity , she condemned Wikileaks for releasing secret diplomatic cables, but declined comment on the authenticity of the material. TsakopoulosKounalakis served as ambassador until 2013 but as Wikileaks confirms, she continued as a key Clinton supporter doing her best to beat back a presidential run by Joe Biden. In a June 11, 2015 email, Eleni Tsakopoulos Kounalakis tells John Podesta that a Bay Area bagman swears Biden is running. He said he took him on Air Force Two, and hes getting emails. Last July, TsakopoulosKounalakis emailed Clinton confidant Jake Sullivan that HRC indicated her view that it would be best to avoid Grexit and a July 9, 2015 email to Sullivan, John Podesta and Huma Abedin, she supports terms that will allow Greece to stay in the Eurozone. On October 11, 2015, Tsakopoulos Kounalakis emailed Podesta that there is a Greek American love fest going on with Joe Biden, very boyclub. The same day she emailed Podesta and Huma Abedin that we had a David Brock dinner with Annie Karni from Politico. She asked to use four quotes from me see attached. I told her the first two could be with attribution, and the second two without. As the emails to John Podesta and Humba Abedin reveal, Ambassador Eleni Kounalakis, as she styles herself, remains part of Hillary Clintons inner circle. Tellingly, the McClatchyTribune newspapers that run her husbands columns, do not acknowledge the strong Clinton connection. The New York Times proclaimed Kounalakis a White Knight for rescuing Washington Monthly , where he served as publisher and teamed with editor Paul Glastris. This tandem made the publication a progressive mustread, according to Clinton strategist James Carville. Kounalakis reported for Newsweek in East Germany and ran their bureau in Prague. He also worked in Moscow for NBC Radio and Mutual news. Kounalakis books include Hope Is a Tattered Flag Voices for the PostBush Era , with Peter Laufer, and Beyond Spin the Power of Strategic Corporate Journalism with Drew Banks and Kim Daus. It remains something of a mystery how the leftist Kounalakis became a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution, known for strong conservative writers and scholars such as Thomas Sowell, Victor Davis Hanson, and Bruce Thornton. Only one time, as this writer recalls, has Kounalakis acknowledged in print his wifes strong Clinton connections. Even after the Wikileaks revelations, and with a presidential election only days away, Kounalakis did not acknowledge his wifes key role in HRCs inner circle with John Podesta and Huma Abedin. His October 30 Sacramento Bee piece suggests Markos is right at home in those circles. Kounalakis attacks the Republican presidential nominee, implying that he is crazy, and a tool of the evil Putin. On the other hand, the Clinton email scandal gets zero attention and the author piles on the ad copy American society has made great strides in LGBTQ rights, womens rights and minority rights, and has a relatively strong and resilient globally innovative economy. The author gives readers good cause to regard this article as pure Clinton campaign propaganda from a camouflaged Clinton crony. Maybe Markos will join his wife, Huma Abedin, and John Podesta in the Wikileaks revelations. For many observers, the issue is not where the leaks came from but whether the revelations are true and authentic. If Markos Kounalakis believes they are bogus, maybe he can write about whats in the real ones.",hate
"Search form Search From Bad to Worse  Obamas Ransom Payment to Iran is Just the Tip of the Iceberg In his bid to pursue a legacy, Obama charts disastrous course with reckless abandon. November 2, 2016 Ari Lieberman Most of us, including several democratic lawmakers, cringed when Obama inked the Iran deal but those of us who are familiar with the malevolent nature of the Iranian regime, recoiled in horror when we learned that Obama transferred 400 million to the Iranians in exchange for four American citizens held captive by the mullahs on trumped up charges. The 400 million was part of a larger installment totaling 1.7 billion, ostensibly to settle claims Iran had against the United States stemming from aborted Iranian arms purchases dating back to the Shah. Obama claimed that this was money that was owed to Iran and the settlement, which included 1.3 billion in interest, saved the U.S. taxpayer billions because the Iranians were demanding even more at the Hague tribunal, where the claim was being adjudicated. The timing and method of the cash transfers were disquieting to say the least and raised serious questions of legality as well as broader geopolitical concerns. The Americans were freed only after Iran received its 400 million. The payment, which was airlifted in the dead of night in an unmarked cargo plane, was made in untraceable cash, stacked on wooden pallets. The Iranians demanded Swiss Francs and Euros rather than Dollars and a pliant Obama agreed to the Islamic Republics dictates. Gleeful Iranian leaders were quick to announce victory and claimed that the payment was indeed a ransom, contradicting the administrations adamant denials. Even within the administration there was confusion about whether the payment was in fact a ransom. State Department spokesman Mark Toner came very close to acknowledging this fact when he noted that the 400 million was used as leverage to ensure the Americans safe return. The White House however, quickly repudiated the State Departments characterization. Even if one were to believe the story peddled by the administration, the mere appearance of a quid pro quo payment potentially exposes the U.S. to extortion and hostagetaking. The Iranians certainly believed it was a ransom payment and more likely than not, every twobit dictator on the planet saw it that way as well. But there are deeper more troubling aspects to this convoluted story. In his January 17, 2016 address to the American people, Obama tried to put a positive spin on his dealings with the Islamic Republic but as noted by Rick Richman in an excellent article featured in Mosaic , the deal struck with the Iranians was rotten to its core and the administration deliberately kept the American people in the dark about various aspects of the shady arrangement. The 400 million that the U.S. transferred to Iran came from Irans Foreign Military Sales FMS account with the Pentagon. The balance of 1.3 billion ostensibly represented interest accrued since 1979. But Obama neglected to note that when Iran filed its lawsuit, the U.S. filed counterclaim against Iran for 817 million for Iranian breaches of its obligations under the FMS program. The U.S. could have conceivably won that counterclaim which would have meant wooden pallets of cash for the American treasury, courtesy of the Islamic Republic. Moreover, American plaintiffs maintained sixteen U.S. court judgments against the Islamic Republic stemming from that regimes involvement in terrorist activities. Those judgments totaled 3.9 billion in compensatory and punitive damages. Some plaintiffs sought to recover their Judgments directly from Irans FMS account but their efforts were stymied by the Clinton administration. Instead, under a convoluted deal struck between Congress and the Clinton administration in 2,000, the U.S. treasury was to pay the holders of the judgments against Iran for the amount of their compensatory damages and 10 percent of their punitive damages up to the amount in the FMS fund. The judgments would then be subrogated to the United States, which meant that judgments became direct U.S claims against the Iranian government. Iran ignored the Judgments and never paid any of the plaintiffs. Under U.S. law, the 400 million sitting in the FMS account should have gone back to the U.S. treasury, which had already paid the judgment holders. But the U.S. treasury never collected a dime on the subrogated claims since Obama shipped the money off on wooden pallets to Iran. Essentially, the U.S. taxpayer ended up footing the bill for Irans terrorism while the Iranians were never held accountable for their maleficence. Obamas actions represented blatant disregard for the law, for the victims of terrorism and for the American taxpayer. His claim of saving the taxpayer billions represents the zenith of mendacity. Obama claimed that the payments had to be made in cash because existing sanctions prohibited normal banking procedures. But as noted by Richman, the sanctions regimen expressly permits payments made to settle Iranian claims instituted at The Hague, exposing yet another lie by the Obama administration. There was one, and only one reason why the Iranians requested cash and all but the most disingenuous know what that reason is. The Iranians are the worlds foremost statesponsors of international terrorism. They finance terrorist groups and proxy militias throughout the region and internationally but can only do so through illicit means that circumvent normal methods of financing. Hence, they demanded untraceable cash. The misery that we are currently witnessing in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere is due in no small part to the Obama administration which provided the Iranians with the cash necessary to keep operations flowing. In addition to the 1.7 billion in cash, Obama also authorized the release of seven convicted Iranian felons and expunged warrants on 14 others. But this aspect of the transaction seems almost trivial when considering the sheer mendacity and illegality of nearly every other aspect of the deal. Lastly, the transfer of such a large sum to Iran in settlement of an alleged legal claim required the attorney generals approval but the administration has yet to produce any document bearing Loretta Lynchs signature authorizing such payment. On October 7, Sen. Marco Rubio R., Fla. and Rep. Mike Pompeo R., Kan. presented Lynch with a series of questions seeking clarification of various aspects of the deal. Lynch, whose tenure as attorney general is proving to be as corrupt and partisan as her predecessor, has inexplicably refused to answer the lawmakers queries. In a desperate attempt to establish a legacy, Obama pursued the Iran deal with reckless abandon, forfeiting positions previously regarded as red lines and signing the worst deal in U.S. diplomatic history. The ancillary deal struck with the Iranians concerning American hostages was laced with outright lies and enabled the Iranians to continue their reign or regional terror. More importantly, it may also have been in violation of existing U.S. law and Lynchs stonewalling only lends credence to that notion.",hate
"Netanyahus Critical Foreign Tour Israels strategic repositioning. Originally published by the Jerusalem Post . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus upcoming trips to Australia, Singapore, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan might be the most significant diplomatic visits he makes in his tenure in office. The trips will take place against the backdrop of two major international shifts that cast Israel into uncharted waters as a small state with a dizzying array of strategic threats arrayed against it. The states that he will visit are all wellpositioned to help Israel navigate its next moves. The first shift is the USs political crackup. Next week American voters will choose their next president. The major candidates, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump, are the weakest candidates to have ever stood for the highest office in the land. Their rise is a testament to the weakening, if not the unraveling of the glue that has held America together since the Civil War. The unraveling of the US electorate comes against the backdrop of the diminution of US military power. The USs multitrillion dollar investment in inconclusive if not failed wars in the Middle East over the past 15 years has come at the expense of military modernization. The F35 program has sucked up the majority of the remaining research and development funds. And it has yet to produce a reliable airplane. Worse, the F35s long and problematic gestation period has given Russia and China the time and opportunity to develop air defense systems capable of neutralizing the F35s stealth systems. Those systems were supposed to be its chief advantage as the next generation fighter for the US and its allies. The deterioration of the USs military capabilities has gone hand in hand with the USs apparent loss of strategic rationality. This is apparent worldwide, but is nowhere more obvious than in the Middle East. President Barack Obamas decision to effectively abandon the USs major allies in the Middle East in favor of cultivating ties with Iran has made the region far more dangerous to the US and its spurned allies than it was eight years ago. True, in theory, Obamas decision to prefer the Shiites to the Sunnis makes sense given the totalitarian and imperial nature of Sunni jihadism. But in light of the genocidal, totalitarian and imperial nature of the current Iranian regime, his move made no sense and its impact has been massively destructive. Moreover, Obamas willingness to rack up the USs national debt in an unprecedented manner and repress economic growth through overregulation has left a large question mark over the possibility of a military buildup. In other words, even under the best circumstances, it is hard to imagine that the US will be capable of reestablishing its global primacy over the next four years or even over the next decade. The implications for Israel are far reaching. For decades, Israels strategic posture has been predicated on its ability to depend on US power. This strategic posture is no longer tenable. The second major international shift is Russias sudden rise as the primary global power in the Middle East. As Channel 2 reported Sunday night, Russia has deployed sophisticated naval and air systems in the region that can detect all of Israels air and naval operations. In a matter of months, Israel has lost the air and naval supremacy it has enjoyed for the past four decades. The air force reportedly is convinced that the F35s stealth systems will be able to neutralize Russias detection capabilities. But given the welldocumented current problems with the F35s stealth systems, this conviction is unwise. And even under the best circumstances, in which Israel has the opportunity to develop its own electronic warfare systems and apply them to its F35 without American interference, it will take Israel years to surmount the challenge that rapidly improving Russian systems present to our air force. According to Channel 2s report, air force and naval commanders are in a panic over the sudden turn of events. Rather than panicking though, Israel needs to roll with the punches and figure out how best to cope with this new situation. The obvious answer is that we need to quickly expand our capabilities in areas that Russias military primacy does not reach. Specifically, Israel needs to expand massively its capacity for undertheradar operations. The first area that needs to be massively strengthened is our intelligence capabilities, particularly human intelligence capabilities. Israel should be investing massively in developing and expanding our cultivation and direction of proxies on the ground throughout the region. Second, Israel needs to adapt its cyber technology capabilities in a manner that diminishes our enemies ability to strike us. Israel needs to be able to disrupt and disable command and control and other systems. Israels reach needs to extend as low down the line of its enemies military chain of command as possible. If our offensive capabilities are being checked, so must the capabilities of our enemies. Indeed, our enemies need to be subverted. Part of the intelligence and cyber capabilities that Israel must develop and deploy must be geared toward destabilizing with the goal of overthrowing the regime in Iran. At the same time, Israel should be empowering antiregime sectors in Iran in a manner that expands the prospect of developing close ties with a successor regime along the lines of the strategic alliance Israel built with the regime of the shah in the decades which preceded the 1979 Islamic revolution. Third, Israel needs to expand and diversify the capabilities of our ground forces. Israel needs to be capable of using new means to deploy its fighters at home and on distant shores. It needs to align its both its special and regular forces with the new threat environment. And it needs to be able to utilize its ground forces in manners that can extend the reach and diminish the compromised positions of its air and naval assets in the era of Russian regional primacy. Fourth, Israel needs to expand its economic growth and diversify its economic ties in a manner that positions it as a regional economic power. It needs to use it natural gas resources specifically as a means to expand and deepen its ties with Asia. Such economic growth and power will positively influence Russias willingness to allow Israel to carry out air and naval operations against its enemies  and Russias allies in Lebanon, Syria and beyond. In other words, the more economically powerful Israel is, the more Russia will be willing to side with Israel against Hezbollah and others that are currently operating under the Russian umbrella. This then brings us to Netanyahus upcoming trips. Each state that he will visit has something to offer Israel in expanding its intelligence, cyberwarfare and economic capabilities. Australia, a major Western economy, is moving toward China as America has become less engaged in the Pacific. Israel has an acute interest in using Australia as a platform for expanding its ties to China and other Asian countries, both because of the economic advantages such ties convey and due to Chinas strategic importance to Russia. As for Singapore, Israel effectively built the Singaporean military in the 1960s and 1970s. The country remains extremely supportive of Israel. Like Australia, Singapore has close ties to China. It has technological and other capabilities that can be extremely advantageous for Israel today. Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan are critically important to Israel today. Their strategic proximity to Iran, and their ties to Russia, along with their ethnic composition and their natural resources make securing good relations with both critical to Israels ability to advance and security its strategic interests in every sphere. Israel has tremendous assets to offer each of the four countries that Netanyahu will visit. These assets must be deployed wisely to ensure that Israel gains as much as possible from his trip and from its future ties with all of them. Given the dramatic changes in the global power balance, and their implications for Israel, Netanyahus decision to fly to visit these four countries just after the US elections tells us that he gets it. At a time of regional and global turbulence and uncertainty, in the context of swiftly multiplying threats, this is no small matter.",hate
"The Hostility and Hypocrisy of LeftWing Israeli NGOs Where are the condemnations of the PAs efforts to prevent normalization with Israel November 2, 2016 Originally written for the Investigative Project on Terrorism. Israeli human rights group BTselem recently appeared before a special session of the United Nations Security Council, excoriating Israel and pleading with the body to act against Israels settlements. In 1975, the UN famously declared that Zionism is racism and, four decades later, the organization continues to hound Israel. In each of the last four years, as the Syrian bloodbath claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, there were at least five times as many resolutions condemning Israel as those rebuking the rest of the world. The UNs cultural body, UNESCO, recently passed a motion ignoring any Jewish or Christian historical ties to East Jerusalem holy sites, referring to the Temple Mount and Western Wall only by their Muslim names and condemning Israel as the occupying power. It turns out that some of Israels leftwing NGOs worked to help produce the UNESCO motion. Given the UNs chronic hostility, efforts by Israeli NGOs to persuade the UN to act against Israel are arguably treasonous. Indeed, one attorney and activist for Israels leftleaning Labor party filed a police complaint alleging treason against BTselem, arguing that the NGO has harmed state sovereignty, tried to give land away to a foreign entity, and taken steps that could cause a war. Israeli democracy is extremely tolerant, to the point of allowing its members of parliament to openly support terrorism and terrorist groups. Last March, several Israeli Arab Knesset members condemned Arab states for labeling Hizballah a terrorist organization, even though it has been at war with Israel for decades and regularly threatens new hostilities. Last February, members from the Joint Arab List paid a solidarity visit to relatives of Palestinian terrorists whom Israeli security forces had killed to stop them from murdering Israelis. In 2014, MK Hanin Zoabi Balad drew praise from Hamas after she asserted that the kidnappers of three missing Israeli youths were not terrorists. Hamass connection to the young mens abduction and murder helped to spark the third war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Thus, Israel already has plenty of dissenting voices and activists without foreign intervention. Nevertheless, foreign interests have identified Israeli NGOs as the soft underbelly of Israeli democracy and have leveraged them to promote their own agendas. The problem became so acute that a watchdog, NGO Monitor, was formed in 2002 to track the selfhostility being funded largely by European and other foreign sources. As the organization notes NGOs lack a system of checks and balances, andprovide accountability to their funders and activist members, and not to the citizens or societies whose lives are directly impacted by their activities. NGO Monitor also notes that, even though most of the foreign government funding for these Israeli NGOs is formally designated for educating the Israeli public and changing public opinion both in violation of the norms on noninterference in other democracies, these Israeli NGOs are very active externally, in the delegitmization and political warfare against Israel. These leftwing Israeli NGOs receive money from about two dozen foreign governments , and some private organizations . That includes millions of dollars from billionaire George Soros. In Catch the Jew , author Tuvia Tenenbom exposed how foreignfunded human rights and cultural organizations in Israel tend to serve as vehicles for attacking Israel. By presenting himself to interview subjects as Tobi the German, Tenenbom elicits some surprising confessions. For example, the New Fund for Cinema and TV, a foreignfunded Israeli cultural NGO, told him that that about 80 percent of political documentaries made in Israel are coproduced by Europeans. That includes a documentary called 10What Makes a Hero, which equates Israels military with the Nazis. Such films would be too scandalous to be produced in Germany, but Germansponsored NGOs can safely pay leftwing Israelis to make such movies. Some foreign funders of Israeli NGOs have even unwittingly enriched Hamas. Last August, Hamas allegedly siphoned off tens of millions of dollars from World Vision, a U.S.based charity, and used the funds for weapons purchases, tunnel construction, and other military activities. The Knesset passed a law in July requiring disclosure of foreign funding sources for NGOs that get more than half of their money from overseas. The law is clearly aligned with the American Foreign Agents Registration Act FARA, wrote legal scholar Eugene Kontorovich, who defended the legislation in response to critics. Israel is unique in the sheer scale of the foreign government sponsorship of domestic political groups, he wrote. For example, the European Union alone has in recent years given roughly 1.2 million Euro a year for political NGOs in the US and roughly an order of magnitude more in Israela vastly larger per capita amount. The Obama administration opposes foreign influence only when that influence promotes a dissenting view. Obama opposed Netanyahus speech to the U.S. Congress against the Iranian nuclear deal, but was happy to give a speech to the UK parliament against Brexit. The Obama administration critiqued Israels NGOfundingdisclosure law , perhaps because it had sent U.S. taxpayer money to an Israeli NGO working to oust Israels prime minister. The same hypocrisy seems to prevail among Israels foreignfunded NGOs. They ostensibly exist to promote democracy and peaceful coexistence, but are conspicuously silent when Palestinian institutions violate those ideals. Such silence enables abuse by Palestinians and promotes a distorted and incomplete picture of the complex reality in which Israelis operate. Foreignfunded Israeli NGOs remained silent after the Palestinian Authority arrested Palestinians who visited a Sukkah in a symbolic peace event promoting coexistence. These organizations are silent when the Palestinian leadership pays salaries to the families of terrorists, glorifies murderers and calls streets and city centers after them, Netanyahu said. These organizations prove again and again that they are not actually interested in human rights, but only in shaming Israel and libeling it around the world. If Israels leftwing NGOs truly are committed to democracy and peace, why havent they condemned the PAs efforts to prevent normalization with Israel In 2014, Jibril Rajoub, the deputy secretary of the Fatah Central Committee and the head of the Palestinian Supreme Council for Sport and Youth Affairs, condemned a coexistencepromoting soccer match between Israeli and Palestinian youths on a southern kibbutz, as a crime against humanity. Last week, a Palestinian newspaper came under intense criticism for publishing an interview with Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman. The Jerusalembased newspaper AlQuds was denounced by Hamas , the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate, and the supposedly moderate PA. The chilling effects and antipeace message implicit in the harsh reactions to the interview have yet to catch the attention of any leftwing NGOs supposedly working for peace and democracy.",hate
"Why Cant Hillary Clinton Stop Telling Stupid Lies November 2,   The biggest mystery about Hillary Clinton isnt any of her scandals. Those are obvious. Its her lies. Not the usual kind of lies. The lies about corruption and greed. The pretense that she agrees with whomever shes talking to at any given time. Its the stupid lies. The ridiculous lies. The lies only a crazy person would tell. This is a stupid lie that took all of 6 seconds to be exposed. Hillarys own book mentions that she wasnt in New York City. She was enough of a public figure that the lie would never hold up. So why tell it This isnt the first time Hillary Clinton got caught senselessly telling stupid lies. There was the famous airport under fire incident. There was her name and Chelsea jogging on 9/11 and negotiating peace in Northern Ireland. Politicians often lie, but Hillary Clinton is unique in telling senseless lies that seem to have no rational purpose except to get caught.",hate
"Black Voters Not Turning Out for Hillary November 2,   Black voters helped Hillary beat Bernie, but theyre not turning out for her in early voting . Neither are millennials. After Sunday nights polls closed, black vot ers accounted for 16 percent of the inperson early vote ballots cast. And that included five previous days of inperson early voting. But in 2012, in just two days of inperson early voting, blacks cast 25 percent of those early ballots, according to Dan Smith, a University of Florida political science professor who published some of the early voting data on his mustread Election Smith blog. Due to such strong AfricanAmerican turnout after the beginning of inperson early voting in 2012, Democrats began outpacing Republicans in total ballots cast before Election Day, by about 10,000. This year, though, Republicans still cling to their own lead of about 9,000. As of Monday morning about 3.7 million absentee and inperson early ballots had been cast, 40.5 percent of them by Republicans and 40.2 percent by Democrats. Hillary is getting Latino support, largely due to the immigration debate, but she just doesnt have the hot sauce draw that her husband and Obama did. That leaves her more dependent on white voters and forces her to zigzag between moderate and extreme positions. Which only adds to her reputation for untrustworthiness.",hate
"FBI Investigates Saudi WifeAbusing Clinton Foundation Donor in Straw Donor Scheme November 2, 2016 Daniel Greenfield Its midnight in America. And the Clintons and the Democratic Party keep finding ways to cover themselves in glory. Im sure the line on this will be that the FBI is acting inappropriately by investigating this. Investigating political corrupt ion interferes with corrupt politicians being elected. The FBI is investigating an alleged illegal donation scheme involving a wealthy Saudi family that supports Democratic Florida Senate candidate Patrick Murphy. Murphy, who has covered himself in glory so often already, is denying everything. And I mean absolutely everything. The Murphy campaign declined to say whether the candidate is aware of the FBI probe Whats your name I decline to answer that question. Murphy, 33, is running against Rubio, the incumbent Republican, in a race that could help decide which party controls the Senate in 2017. Rubio currently leads Murphy by an average of 5.6 percentage points, according to RealClearPolitics. The FBI investigation, however, relates to Murphys first run for the House in the 2012 campaign cycle. The allegation  originally submitted by a Republican super PAC run by a former top aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy.  is that Murphys high school friend and major political donor, Ibrahim AlRashid, coordinated a straw donor scheme to boost Murphy. Murphy knows nothing Murphys campaign declined to say whether Murphys attorneys had discussed the FBI investigation with AlRashids attorney. Uhhuh AlRashid is the son of a powerful and politically connected Saudi billionaire. Hes been a major financial benefactor of Murphys, giving almost 400,000 to his campaigns and to outside groups supporting the Florida congressman. Heres how some of these donations worked. One example within the alleged scheme A woman who describes herself in federal donation reports as the owner and property manager of a Texasbased company, Limestone Property Management, gave Murphys campaign 300. But she is neither the property manager nor the owner of the Texasbased company. In fact, she doesnt work there. She lived in Miami at the time and was Ibrahim AlRashids cleaning lady, according to a MiamiDade Police Department report filed in 2012 over a home burglary at AlRashids property. Texas property manager vs Saudis cleaning lady. Thats quite a difference. Murphy has been forced to return AlRashids donations before for purely Islamophobic reasons. AlRashids three sons have followed in their fathers political footsteps, contributing large sums to top Democrats, including Rep. Patrick Murphy D., Fla., whose Senate race could help decide which party controls the Senate in 2017. Murphy has already returned a portion of alRashids donations due to his involvement in a domestic assault incident. Ibrahim alRashid allegedly forced his way into his estranged wifes Pennsylvania home, where alRashid allegedly grabbed her by the wrist, struck her about the head and face with a closed fist then threw her to the ground, according to a copy of the police report viewed by the Free Beacon. Following the 2014 incident, alRashid allegedly sent his wife a text message stating, I am not sorry this time I hope you die in hell, according to the police report. Murphy, a longtime friend of alRashid, was recently forced to donate around 16,000 in campaign funds to domestic violence groups after the assault charge became a public liability for the campaign. Murphy also returned all of the donations made by alRashid during the last three political cycles. Is the Clinton Foundation involved in this Do the Clintons do their business in golden and marble toilets Nasser alRashid, one of Saudi Arabias wealthiest figures and an adviser to the countrys royal family, has donated somewhere between 1 million to 5 million to the Clinton Foundation, putting him in an elite category of prominent donors. The Clintons. If theres dirt anywhere, youll find it on them.",hate

There hasnt been a president and a party who were this blatantly corrupt ever. Theres no question that Obama has made history. Its just the wrong kind of history. Initially the White House chose not to join Hillarys war on the FBI. Then Obama threw all caution to the winds and decided to echo the spin chambers lines about innuendo and incomplete information. Never mind that it was Obamas own DOJ which was blocking FBI efforts to secure the emails and resolve the issue.

"College Forces Mandatory Microaggression Sessions on Faculty After Prof Accuses Student of Plagiarism November 2, 2016 College is now a politically correct joke . Suffolk Universitys interim president said Tuesday that the college will hold mandatory microaggression training for all faculty in response to an outcry last week after a Latina student wrote a viral blog post saying she was the victim of a professors racial bias. What did this racial bias involve Tiffany Martinez.said an unidentified Suffolk sociology professor handed back a paper she had written and in front of the class and told Martinez, This is not your language, insinuating that Martinez had plagiarized. Martinez posted a photo of the paper on her blog, showing where the professor appears to have written please go back and indicate where you cut and paste. The professor had circled the word hence in the paper and wrote, this is not your word. In this interaction, my undergraduate career was both challenged and critiqued, the student wrote. It is worth repeating how my professor assumed I could not use the word hence, a simple transitory word that connected two relating statements. The professor assumed I could not produce quality research. Most college students, regardless of whether their ancestors originated from southern Europe or not, do not tend to use hence in a sentence. Hence, its the sort of word that professors seize on and suspect that what they are seeing is cut and paste material. Tiffanys interaction has happened thousands of times with students regardless of race. But Tiffany is lucky enough to be a privileged minority. Which means that she cant be treated like everyone else lest she whine about it and a flood of social justice crybullies descend on Suffolk U. Kelly, the interim president, also sent a note to the school on Friday after the Buzzfeed article was posted. The truth is that all of us here at Suffolk should be concerned about any student feeling this way, Kelly wrote in her Tuesday blog post. She said the school has experienced an outpouring of support for Martinez from other students, faculty and staff. Privilege. This is what it looks like. Scholars and Rogues fights a last stand against the decline and fall of journalism by stating the obvious . In short, what we have here isnt merely iffy reporting on an academic dustup. Its a microcosm of what has happened to journalism in modern America. These headlines are certain to entice Web surfers to click, and if the reporters can so easily be suckered into outrage then how can we possibly expect a rational reading by the average product of the American ed system, which has been stripped of all pretense at teaching critical thinking. The result an emotionally pitched, unsubstantiated claim of injustice has been instantly transformed into cold, hard fact. Well yes. Meanwhile heres a sample of Tiffanys writing. You can decide whether she organically used hence in a sentence. A Declaration of Self Love Im familiar negotiating who I am to please others. Some may call me inauthentic, I call this selfprotection. However, I have burned through my shields. Too tired to be exhausted, this continuous disguise has faded. Its time I accept myself and no longer sacrifice selflove for overall acceptance. The crybullies of the selfesteem generation can never get enough of loving itself and hating everyone who interferes with its boundless appetite for selflove.",hate
"Majority of Americans Side With FBI Over Hillary November 3, 2016 Daniel Greenfield In a fit of thundering insanity, Hillary Clinton, her media pals and Barack Obama decided to go to war with the FBI. Their pretext was that Hillary Clinton is supposed to have immunity from the FBI before the election. And Comey was being irresponsible and violating protocol, the Hatch Act and the Thou Shalt Not Impede the Electoral Prospects of Democrats mandate. Most Americans have the good sense to think that this is a bunch of rubbish . Hillary Clinton and President Obama are outraged about the F.B.I.director James Comeys decision to disclose further inquiries into her handling of confidential email, but are the American people Shockingly the American people are not all that outraged about the FBI investigating a corrupt criminal... not nearly as much as the corrupt criminal and her political allies are. In an online Morning Consult poll of approximately 3,200 registered voters, only 19 percent agreed with the statement that prosecutors should wait until after Election Day to make announcements about investigations concerning political figures or elected officials. Instead,60 percent agreed that prosecutors should be able to make announcements about investigations concerning political figures or elected officials close to Election Day even if it might affect the election. Another 21 percent said they dont know or had no opinion. In news thats shocking to the Times, the American people are once again out of step with their leftwing masters. When the investigation into Mrs. Clinton was mentioned before the question, partisans differed by almost 50 percentage points in their attitude toward preelection disclosures, which were endorsed by 83 percent of Republicans but just 34 percent of Democrats  an even larger gap than observed with the generic prompt. By contrast, mentioning Mr. Trumps foundation eliminated the gap between the parties in support for publicizing investigations, which was backed by 57 percent of Democrats and 58 percent of Republicans. One might conclude that Republicans are the more ethical and honest party.",hate
"Go to Article Parents who plan on refinancing their homes in order to send their children off to college should instead consider encouraging them to specialize in a trade. Speaking as a Ph.D. in philosophy who has spent the last 17 years teaching at the college level, Im perhaps the last person from whom advice of this sort is expected. But it is precisely because of my familiarity with academia that I beseech the college bound and their enablersI mean their supportersto revisit their plans. Whether one regards a postsecondary institution as a means to either a remunerative profession or a genuine education, the tragic fact of the matter is that the contemporary academic world is about as politicized a cultural institution as any. More specifically, it is a bastion of Political Correctness, a decidedly leftist ideology that tolerates no competition. For the last 11 years, Professor Duke Pesta, who is currently an associate professor of English at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh, has taught literature at a range of colleges. At the outset of each semester, he would quiz his students on their knowledge of American and Western history. What he found is that the overwhelming number of them believed that slaveryan institution, mind you, that is as old as humanity itself, was practiced in virtually every society the planet over, and that lasted only some 87 years in the United States was an exclusively American phenomenon . Most of my students could not tell me anything meaningful about slavery outside of America, Pesta told The College Fix. His students are convinced that slavery was an American problem that more or less ended with the Civil War and they are very fuzzy about slavery prior to the Colonial era. Their entire education about slavery, he adds, was confined to America. Yet it isnt just students who display an astonishing ignorance of slavery. Over at Boston University, Saida Grundy , an Assistant Professor of sociology and AfricanAmerican Studies, tweeted that slavery is a white peoplething. Grundy didnt stop there. She asks is white peoples new deflection from dealing with slavery that all races have had slaves thing is this the new #AllLivesMatter Professor Grundy added other enlightening tweets for the record, NO race outside of Europeans had a system that made slavery a personhood instead of temporary condition there is also no race except Europeans who kidnapped and transported human beings in order to enslave them and their offspring for life before Europeans invented it as such, slavery was not a condition that was de facto inherited from parent to child. In case white folks couldnt follow the thrust of her rant, Grundy offers a summation of her sophisticated position in other words, deal with your white sht, white people. slavery is a YALL thing. In addition to assigning blame for slavery solely to white Europeans, Grundy claimed that white masculinity is THE problem for americas colleges. Over at the University of Pittsburgh, students who were distributing proDonald Trump materials were harassed and attacked . The Trump supporters were accused of backing a racist candidate who espouses hate speech. They were greeted by chants of fk the white male patriarchy and, eventually, physical aggression. One of the victims said that my campus shouldnt be a place where my friends and I are fearful for having opposing opinions. These students were accosted by other students. Students elsewhere, however, have had professors with which to contend. At the University of California at Los Angeles UCLA, a political science professor, Michael Chwe, wrote in a blog post for Princeton University Press that the danger to democracy itself is posed by Trump supporters. This danger is real and must be confronted. Chwe maintains that Trump and his supporters are the greatest danger to democracy since World War II, even perhaps since the Civil War. Chwe thinks that had we done a better and earlier job with confronting, as opposed to accommodating, white and male privilegewe might not have reached this situation the Trump phenomenon. We must set our sights on combatting these forms of privilege now, though, if we hope to divert democracy away from selfdestruction. And it isnt just faculty in the humanities and liberal arts that cant resist injecting their politics into the classroom. A math professor at Mount Holyoke College, an allfemale school, was recently captured on video launching into an antiTrump/proClinton tirade in class. While he never referred to either candidate by name, Peter Rosnicks choice for president was plain. This election, Rosnick said, is the scariest that hes ever witnessed. He told his students that they should vote for someone who thinks women are full and capable and responsible and intelligent beings who should not be the object of, um, should not be objectified. Rosnick also prescribed his students to vote for whoever you want, but vote for somebody who respects the fact that this is a country built on immigrantsthat this is a country that couldnt, that wouldnt be what it is if it wasnt for bringing immigrants into our nation and respecting them and respecting what they bring to our country. At least one of Rosnicks students was less than enthused over his proselytizing efforts. Speaking on condition of anonymity, this student told The College Fix that she found it highly inappropriate for a math teacher to use my class time to try to tell me who to vote for. Indeed. But this, unfortunately, is hardly an anomaly in 2016. Thus, parents should think hard before divesting themselves of tens and tens of thousands of dollars so that their children can become targets of political indoctrination.  ",hate
"Go to Article Nothing ought to be plainer, and yet nothing is more obscured, than the meaning of the Islamic concept of jihad. Even if its meaning were at all unclear, every day Islamic jihadists do their best to remind us of what it is. The confusion arises, of course, from the fact that jihad and related concepts are the object of a massive misinformation and disinformation campaign, making books such as William Kilpatricks The Politically Incorrect Guide to Jihad so vitally necessary. Kilpatrick covers that propaganda campaign ably in this lucid and genial book, which not only explains from Islamic texts and teachings why ISIS and Boko Haram and other jihad terror groups are not only not unIslamic, as is frequently claimed, but quintessentially Islamic  for the Quran, as Kilpatrick explains, commands jihad, and Muhammad, who is considered in Islamic theology to the perfect man, to be imitated by Muslims whenever, wherever, and however possible, not only commanded jihad warfare but waged it himself. Kilpatrick also helpfully takes up common objections to this line of argumentation  notably the question of why, if Islam really teaches warfare against unbelievers and their subjugation under the hegemony of Islamic law, most Muslims are peaceful. Peaceful Islam, Kilpatrick points out, which Western leaders are counting on to win out over the more violent versions touted by the terrorists, is a holdover from the longdead colonial era. Indeed so the formulation of jihad as primarily an interior spiritual struggle was touted by Islamic scholars at the height of the colonial period, so as to allow for accommodation of the colonial occupiers, who werent going away in the foreseeable future. Once they did abscond, however, the conditions that called forth such accommodative teachings no longer existed, and Saudifunded jihad preachers traversed the globe calling Muslims back to jihad, the forgotten obligation of warfare against unbelievers. The Politically Incorrect Guide to Jihad shows that this transition had nothing to do with poverty among Muslims or discrimination against them, and indeed, that no conciliation or concession on the part of Western nonMuslims will ever blunt the force of the jihad imperative, since it is rooted in Islamic theological principles that are not susceptible to the prevailing political winds. The most valuable sections, however, of this useful and engaging book are the second, Jihad Without Bombs, and the third, Defeating Jihad. For even as violent jihad becomes an increasingly common feature of the Western landscape, more insidious and damaging in the long run may be the stealth jihad that proceeds due to the appeasement policies that Western governments indefatigably pursue, and the politically correct straitjacket on the public discourse that has for well over a decade now hindered, and usually prevented outright, honest discussion in the mainstream media of the nature and magnitude of this threat. Kilpatrick points out that according to Reporters Without Borders, the U.S. has dropped to fortysixth place in press freedom. One of the principal ways in which the press today reveals itself to be a mouthpiece of moneyed elites is in its deliberate attempts to obfuscate the ideological roots of the jihad threat, and its ongoing campaign, every time there is a jihad attack, to inundate us with articles explaining that Islam is really quite wonderful and has nothing to do with this violence, nothing at all. But Kilpatrick details how the media and governing elites are not in the least singular in appearing determined to foster complacency and ignorance among the people they should be enlightening and protecting. The churches are in on the act as well Christians, writes Kilpatrick, have been lulled into complacency by the oftrepeated emphasis on the similarities between their faith and the faith of Muslims  an emphasis all too many Church leaders, including, of course, Pope Francis, relentlessly hammer home, heedless of the danger in which they are putting their flock by leaving them intellectually, spiritually, and physically defenseless in the face of an advancing and growing threat. Thats why the most apposite sentence in this entire book is the second sentence of the chapter headed Strategies for Victory First weve got to get serious. The West suffers from a collective lack of seriousness that could, in the end, be fatal. The frivolity is at the top, fueled by globalist internationalists who are using the complacency the media, the government and the Church are fostering for their own ends. The Politically Incorrect Guide to Jihad is the perfect book for those who dont know just how bad things are, and how likely they are to get even worse  as well as for all who wish to chart a way out of this madness. It can be done. William Kilpatrick does it, quite well, in this book.  ",hate
"Go to Article Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. Once upon a time, factchecking meant that newspapers, radio stations and television news broadcasts were obligated to check their facts before broadcasting or publishing them. Some newspapers and magazines boasted renowned departments filled with intellectuals whose restless minds roved over each line to ensure that the fewest possible errors would appear under that publications masthead. But factchecking of the media by itself has declined almost as badly as the Roman Empire. Errors routinely appear under storied mastheads followed by corrections that are published as a janitorial duty. There is very little concern for the facts even among the great names of publishing and broadcasting. The media has stopped factchecking itself and it now uses factchecking largely to refer to a type of opinion journalism in which it checks the facts of public figures. The fall of factchecking within the media has paralleled the rise of fact checking by the media of its political opponents. The media has become factless even as it deploys a term that once meant selfcorrection to instead correct others. Fact checks once meant that reporters were expected to be accurate. These days theyre only expected to be politically correct. The media deploys fact checks to check political correctness, not facts. Its fact checks routinely venture into areas that are not only partisan, but subjective matters of opinion. Consider Politicos often mocked fact check of Donald Trump as to whether ISIS was indeed unbelievably evil. Under a banner headline, Donald Trumps Week of Misrepresentations, Exaggerations and HalfTruths, it zoomed in on a quote from his Florida rally. Were presiding over something that the world has not seen. The level of evil is unbelievable, Trump had said. Politico swooped in to correct the candidate with its fact check. Judging one level of evil against another is subjective, but other groups in recent history have without any question engaged in as widespread killing of civilians as ISIS. There were no facts being checked here because Politico doesnt seem to know what a fact even is. The only information conveyed by this fact check is that Politico, like the rest of the media, does not like Donald Trump and would find a way to argue with him if he said that the sky was blue. In the Daily Show media culture where overt bias and trolling are virtues, factchecking is just another snotty variety of editorializing that attempts to compensate for perceptions of bias not with higher ethical and factual standards, but by rebranding its editorials as fact checks to gain credibility. The ISIS evil fact check of Trump came from the same media outlet whose White House reporter decided that the Wisconsin flag, which carries the date 1848 to mark the states admission to the Union, was a flag for the local union, Wisconsin 1848. Politico ran an entire story asserting that Obama was flying a labor flag to oppose Governor Walker because its reporter couldnt process basic history. This is what happens when media outlets think that factchecking is something that they do to Republicans rather than to themselves. Factchecking was one of those dinosaurs of journalism, like objectivity, which is viewed as largely irrelevant in a media culture whose Edward R. Murrow is Jon Stewart. Todays millennial journalists spend most of their time exchanging sarcastic quips with their peers on Twitter, aspire to found their own Vox sites and write viral blog posts that seek a new angle on a trending leftwing narrative. Fact checks often function as narrative defenses and meme attacks. Thats why the Washington Post decided to fact check a Saturday Night Live gag about Obamas illegal alien amnesty. Its not that anyone imagines that Saturday Night Live is in the business of producing facts that need checking. The Post was just worried that one of its jokes would go viral and hurt Obama and his agenda. Its the same reason that the paper fact checked a 13yearold boy who claimed he was blocked by Obama on Twitter. This isnt about the facts. Its paranoia about social media narratives going viral. This is more understandable if you stop thinking of the media in the oldfashioned sense as a series of papers, radio and television stations and start thinking of it as a massive machine that advocates for leftwing policies using its massive infrastructure and wealth to monopolize internet narratives. Media outlets trade on their history, but they dont resemble their past selves in any meaningful way. The New Yorker once boasted a factchecking department that was famous for its range, its depth and its resourcefulness in running down even the most obscure facts. But what use is such a thing at David Remnicks New Yorker whose big draw comes from Andy Borowitzs insipid near parodies The New Republic went from respected liberal publication to another snarky and shrill social justice blog. CBS News cited a psychic site to explain that a fly landed on Hillarys face to help her cope with stress. This isnt material that exists in the same realm as facts. Its snarky contempt alternating with lowest common denominator propaganda. Leftwing journalism, like most leftwing culture, is totalitarian antiintellectualism masquerading as enlightened intellectualism. The Soviet Union was quite fond of culture. It just hated the creative process that produced it because it was independent of Communist ideology. The left loves journalism it just hates the objectivity that validates journalism as more than propaganda. Its this perverse antiintellectualism that turned factchecking from selfdiscipline to attack ad. Once journalism became pure leftwing advocacy, it also became inherently correct by virtue of being leftwing and was not in need of having its facts checked. When fact checks stopped being something that journalists did to themselves, first facts and then fact checks became meaningless. Unable to even recognize a fact, media fact checkers just wrote editorials which spiced their leftwing attacks on Republicans liberally with cargo cult invocations to fact as if it were some deity. The average media fact check is a masterpiece of unintentional comedy for thinking adults. At the Washington Post , Michelle Yee fact checks Donald Trumps comment that Hillarys email scandal is bigger than Watergate and concludes that since Watergate led to Nixons resignation and Hillarys email scandal has yet to lead to any convictions, it cant be bigger than Watergate. Since the scandal has yet to be resolved, a fact check of it could only take place in the future. CNN featured Toronto Star fact checker Daniel Dale who claimed that Trump said 35 lies in one day. The list of lies included deeming Trumps statement that Hillary would raise taxes false because her plan only taxes the rich, asserting that there is no such thing as a phony poll and denying that Hillary Clinton had received debate questions. Some of these lies are themselves lies. Others, like Yee, show an inability to even understand what a fact is and what can and cant be deemed false. Just how degraded fact checking had become was made manifest when Hillary Clinton pleaded at the debate, Please, fact checkers, get to work. Her campaign site touted its own fact checking which was mostly indistinguishable from the medias fact checking. That was a commentary on the transformation of the media into a leftwing politicians spin center. Nearly every media outlet now boasts a fact check blog or headlines touting fact checks. But the biggest fact checking department of the media, rather than by the media, isnt in the United States, but in Germany. In America, fact checking has become a type of partisan attack launched by media outlets at their political opponents. Its bigger than ever and also more worthless than ever because it is factless. And those who do it often not only dont know the facts, but dont even know what a fact is.  ",hate
"Go to Article The Obama Department of Justice has been corruptly aiding and abetting the Democratic Partys presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, to escape legal accountability for her actions. From Attorney General Loretta Lynch on down through the Justice Departments political ranks, the Department has blocked the FBI from searching for the truth and following the evidence of potential criminality to its logical conclusion. Whether it is Hillarys use of a private email server while serving as Secretary of State or her involvement in the payforplay Clinton enterprise known as the Clinton Foundation, the Obama administration is applying a banana republicstyle double standard to pervert justice and the rule of law in order to shield her. Lynch and President Obama were reportedly furious with FBI Director James Comey for sending a letter to Congress on October 28 th indicating that new evidence potentially pertinent to the email case had come to light, which required further investigation. This evidence consisted of a batch of emails FBI investigators had found on one or more computers belonging to Anthony Weiner, Clinton confidante Huma Abedins estranged husband, while they were searching for evidence in an unrelated case involving Weiners alleged sexting to an underage girl. Comey sent his letter after months of agonizing over his previous decision to let Hillary off the hook in the email case last July. He was said by a source close to him to have been particularly disturbed by the mounting number of resignation letters from FBI agents who felt betrayed by that decision. Department of Justice officials had leaned on Comey not to send the letter to Congress, claiming that it would violate Department protocols and procedures against taking any action that could be perceived as interfering with the upcoming presidential election. To his credit, Comey ignored the Department officials objections, claiming he had an obligation to keep the Congress and the public informed of any potentially significant new developments in the case. Democrats, who had lavished praise on Comey for his July decision, lashed out at Comey for sending his letter updating Congress. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid went so far as to make the baseless charge that Comey may have violated the law by informing Congress, because, Reid argued, he appeared to be taking sides in an election. The disgraced former Attorney General Eric Holder, held in contempt of Congress for withholding information relating to the Fast and Furious scandal, said about Comeys action, I fear he has unintentionally and negatively affected public trust in both the Justice Department and the FBI. It is up to the director to correct his mistake  not for the sake of a political candidate or campaign but in order to protect our system of justice and best serve the American people. Since when has Holder been genuinely concerned about protecting our system of justice and best serving the American people Holder had already contributed to the erosion of public trust, with his blatant politicization of the Obama Department of Justice. As evidenced by the Obama Department of Justices handling of the multiple FBI investigations involving Hillary Clinton, the Department has continued its slide into the muck of corruption. It interfered with both the normal course of criminal investigations and the election by stacking the deck in Hillarys favor, ensuring that no indictment would occur to derail her path to succeed Obama and preserve his legacy. First, the Department of Justice reportedly refused to empanel a grand jury in either the email case or in connection with the FBIs investigation of the Clinton Foundation payforplay allegations. The problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation, former assistant FBI director James Kallstrom said . Thats the problem. They never had a grand jury empanelled, and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled, Im sure, is Loretta Lynch would not go along with that. Kallstroms belief that Lynch acted to influence the results of the FBI probes in Hillarys favor is buttressed by Lynchs 30 minute private tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton shortly before FBI Director Comey faced the cameras on July 5 th with his exculpatory announcement. Second, at least five immunity agreements were handed out in the email case, including to Hillarys lawyer and confidante Cheryl Mills and to Platte River Networks Paul Combetta. It appears that Combetta had previously lied to government investigators  a crime in itself  while trying to cover up the fact that he had evidently Bleachbited emails to delete them, even though they had been subject to a previously issued Congressional subpoena. The immunity agreements garnered nothing in return, but had the effect of blocking access to the computer devices of the immunity beneficiaries in the FBIs separate Clinton Foundation investigation. Apparently, the Department decided against the alternative option of subpoenaing the computer devices or seeking a search warrant, rather than granting useless immunities, in order to obtain any evidence relevant to the email investigation that might have been contained in those devices. Third, the Department and FBI did not conduct their last minute interview of Hillary Clinton under oath and allowed Cheryl Mills  herself a material witness  to sit in during Hillarys interview. They did not ask pertinent followup questions. There was no verbatim transcript of the interview to use in checking the veracity of Hillarys statements during the interview against her sworn Congressional testimony or her many public statements. Fourth, the Department of Justice reportedly refused to allow the FBI to issue subpoenas to gather more evidence in connection with its investigation of the Clinton Foundation payforplay allegations. In fact, senior Department officials reportedly would not authorize a more thorough FBI investigation because they claimed there was not sufficient evidence gathered thus far to justify going further. Such a circular argument was a mere cover to prevent seasoned career investigators from learning the full extent of foreign government donations while Hillary was Secretary of State, their true motivations and any favors extended by the State Department in return. Finally, the crossconnections between the Clintons and some high level Department of Justice and FBI officials cry out for recusal. But not so in this administration. For example, the wife of the deputy FBI director who was involved in the laggard Clinton Foundation investigation, Andrew McCabe, just happened to have received a large donation from close Clinton ally Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe to her 2015 run for the State Senate. To make matters worse, the Obama Department of Justice assigned Assistant Attorney General Peter J. Kadzik, a close friend of Hillary Clintons campaign manager John Podesta, to communicate with Congress about what Kadzik promised would be a thorough review of the newly discovered emails from Anthony Weiners online account. Podesta praised Kadzik in an email to an Obama campaign official back in 2008 as a Fantastic lawyer, and said about his pal, Kept me out of jail. Their history together goes further back than that. During the waning days of Bill Clintons presidency, it was Kadzik, then representing the infamous billionaire fugitive Marc Rich, who lobbied Podesta, then serving as Bill Clintons chief of staff, for a presidential pardon on his clients behalf. Kadziks lobbying effort, no doubt helped along by contributions to Hillary Clintons Senate campaign and to Bill Clintons presidential library, paid off. Bill Clinton delivered the requested pardon on his last day in office. Kadzik joined the Department of Justice in April 2013, first as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs, and then as the Principal Deputy. With the Podesta connection intact, Kadzik has served as a highly placed Clinton campaign mole in the Department. An email dated May 19, 2015 from Kadzik to Podesta, released by WikiLeaks , proves the point. Bearing the subject heading Heads Up, Kadzik advised Podesta about upcoming Congressional testimony by the head of the Departments Civil Division, and about another filing in the Freedom of Information case that would mean it will be awhile 2016 before the State Department posts the emails. Podesta forwarded Kadziks heads up email to several senior Hillary Clinton campaign officials with the admonition Additional chances for mischief. Exploiting his coordinating role in the reopened email investigation and contacts with FBI investigators, Kadzik will now be in a position to relay inside information to his pal Podesta and to provide inside information to the Clinton campaigns supporters in Congress as well. The Clintons manage to turn virtually everything they touch into a cesspool of corruption. The Obama Department of Justice is no exception.  ",hate
"FBI Believes 5 Foreign Intel Agencies Got Into Hillarys Server November 3, 2016 Daniel Greenfield Just one of those honest mistakes leading to a massive violation of national security by anyone who felt like it. These are still reports from various insider sources, but if true, this would be a major factor in how much damage Hillarys cover up did . Authorities now believe there is about a 99 percent chance that up to five foreign intelligence agencies may have accessed and taken emails from Hillary Clintons private server, two separate sources with intimate knowledge of the FBI investigations told Fox News. The revelation led House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul to describe Clintons handling of her email system during her tenure as secretary of state as treason. She exposed information to our enemies, McCaul said on Fox  Friends Thursday morning. Our adversaries have this very sensitive information.  In my opinion, quite frankly, its treason. McCaul, RTexas, said that FBI Director James Comey told him previously that foreign adversaries likely had gotten into her server. When Comey publicly discussed the Clinton email case back in July, he also said that while there was no evidence hostile actors breached the server, it was possible they had gained access. If true, this is much more than possible, and it would explain the level of outrage within the FBI at the pass that Hillary Clinton has received.",hate
"Why Time Magazines Joe Klein Is So Wrong About Hillary Clinton Rebutting the absurd claims of my namesake. November 4, 2016 Joseph Klein Time Magazines Joe Klein has just penned an article entitled Why Hillary Clinton Is the Only Choice to Keep America Great. I feel duty bound to respond to at least the most absurd of the comments made by namesake and author of Primary Colors, the novel based on about Bill Clintons first presidential campaign in 1992. The other Joe Klein laments that Hillary has been so severely damaged in the course of the 30year battering shes received at the hands of extremists and the media. Sorry, but Hillarys wounds are selfinflicted. Her lies, greed and corruption go back decades and have now reached a crescendo with the dual scandals of her use of a private server for State Department business while she was Secretary of State and of the payforplay Clinton Foundation. There is one part of Trump that is indisputably real his ego, the other Joe Klein wrote, as if Hillary were the epitome of humility and grace. Those who would put Clintons failings in the same league as Trumps depravities are delusional, declared Klein. I agree with his statement, but for precisely the opposite reason that he advances. Trump did not abuse a public office for personal gain. He did not hand pick Hillarys word an ambassador to serve in one of the most dangerous countries in the world and then never respond to his multiple requests for enhanced security, let alone pick up the phone and contact Ambassador Chris Stevens directly. The government was not able to save four lives, to keep four lives safe. How can you keep a country safe asked Stevens former fianc in a rhetorical question that Hillary would be unable to answer. Trump did not lie to the families of those slain in Benghazi, as Hillary did. Trump did not put national security at risk by using a private server for government emails in order to evade the Freedom of Information Act, as Hillary did. In short, anyone who thinks that Hillarys proven record of recklessness, mendacity, and indifference is not more troubling by several orders of magnitude than Trumps depravities is delusional. The other Joe Klein complains that Trump deals in stereotypes  the blacks, the Hispanics, the Muslims, the women and, yes, even the veterans. Yet much of Hillarys pitch is genderbased. Elect her because she is a woman. And she attacks millions of people who support her opponent with vile epithets  deplorable, racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic, and  for good measure  irredeemable. The other Joe Klein charges that Trump is about all that has gone wrong in our society, and nothing of what has gone right. To paraphrase Bill Clinton, that would depend on what your definitions of wrong and right are. Is Hillary Clinton really right when she parrots Black Lives Matters stereotypical attacks on what she herself has characterized as white privilege and systemic racism in this country Is she right when she leaps to conclusions about police brutality aimed against AfricanAmericans before the evidence in specific cases is carefully examined I dont think so. Hillary also represents the political correctness and antireligious bigotry of the secular left elite that many Americans believe are what truly have gone wrong in our society. At the Women in the World Summit last year, for example, Hillary said that in order to fully secure the reproductive rights of women, deepseated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed. Hillary demeaned the sincerely held religious belief in the sanctity of life held by millions of Americans, reminiscent of President Obamas contemptuous clinging to religion quote back in 2008. Hillarys key supporters and top aides have targeted the Catholic Church in particular for their notion of progressive reform. There needs to be a Catholic Spring, in which Catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the Catholic Church, wrote Sandy Newman, president of Voices for Progress, in an email to Clintons campaign chairman John Podesta. In response, Podesta picked up on the spring theme. He wrote, We created Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good to organize for a moment like this. But I think it lacks the leadership to do so now. Likewise Catholics United. Like most Spring movements, I think this one will have to be bottom up. When Time Magazines Joe Klein talks about what is right or wrong in American society, he should get out of his Washington D.C. bubble more often and actually speak with the American people about their daytoday concerns. Even if Hillary Clinton ends up winning the election, the country will remain divided and she will have no mandate whatsoever to advance her progressive agenda.",hate
"The unraveling of Hillarys corrupt sphere of influence. November 4, 2016 Michael Cutler The 2016 elections are in the final stretch and were shaken to the core by the latest revelations from FBI Director James Comey on Friday, October 28, 2016 as reported by NBC News on October 30 th ,  FBI Obtains Warrant for Newly Discovered Emails in Clinton Probe  as Reid Accuses Comey of Hatch Act Violation . Once again the Clinton scandal is creating turmoil in a presidential election that has gone way beyond unconventional. Indeed, Tom Clancy could not have scripted this years presidential election and intrigues. While Comeys recent remarks regarding the Clinton investigation have been extremely vague, the issue to focus on is how Hillarys use of a private computer server, private email account and nonsecure digital devices to store, send and receive classified materials may have drawn others into her tangled web of deception. The current focus of the Clinton quagmire is on whether or not the laptop computer shared by Weiner and his estranged wife contains sensitive information. If that laptop had been hacked both Weiner and Abedin could have been vulnerable to blackmail. This was an issue raised by Congressman Louie Gohmert, Texan Republican and former judge in a Fox News Business interview on October 31, 2016 in a segment that was posted under the title,  Rep. Gohmert Clinton is a potential victim of blackmail . Additional individuals may also have been drawn into this web of deception through these emails as well. A chain is as strong as its weakest link. The weak links begin with Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin and may now include Anthony Weiner and perhaps others. Meanwhile, there is no way to yet determine how many other weak links are out there petrified that WikiLeaks or perhaps, a hacker may yet disclose their improper dealings with the Clintons or their foundation. Could not these additional individuals be subject to blackmail as well Lets take a moment to understand how all of this began. Just months earlier Hillary Clinton had been let off the hook by an FBI Director who, in his official statement on July 5, 2016 , included this excerpt To be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances, a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences. To the contrary, those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions. But that is not what we are deciding now. By Comeys own words, anyone else might have had their security clearance lifted permanently. This raises the issue about such an individual demonstrating fitness for duty as president and raises the question as to why Comey did not see fit to take comparable action with Ms Clinton. Comeys ultimate decision to not present the case to a Grand Jury was frustrating to those who have had security clearances and fully understand just how profound an impact these transgressions might have on national security. However, perhaps Comeys hard to comprehend decision can be traced to a meeting between Bill Clinton and Attorney General Loretta Lynch less than one week before the FBI Director conducted that press conference. On June 29, 2015 ABC News15 reported,  US Attorney General Loretta Lynch, Bill Clinton meet privately in Phoenix before Benghazi report . That article served as a predication for my article,  Loretta Lynchs Private Meeting With Bill Clinton Prior to Release of Benghazi Report  Why would the Attorney General, who sets the tone for law enforcement, do this As Attorney General, Lynch is FBI Director Comeys boss. At the time of this meeting the Justice Department was not only investigating Hillarys illegal use of a private email server, nonsecure personal digital devices but was also, conducting an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. In fact, on October 30, 2016 Breitbart reported,  Clinton Foundation FBI Investigation Confirmed By Former Assistant FBI Director . Therefore Bill Clinton, was likely the target of an ongoing criminal investigation yet he had a totally inappropriate private meeting with the Attorney General to supposedly discuss golfing and grandchildren. However, just days after that meeting, news organizations reported that Hillary was contemplating keeping Lynch on as Attorney General if she won the election. On July 4, 2016 Newsmax reported,  NY Times Clinton Weighs Keeping Lynch as Attorney General if She Wins . Hillarys statement that she might keep Lynch on as Attorney General could have provided the incentive for Lynch to Go along to get along. Indeed, Lynch did precisely that during her confirmation hearing as I described in my commentary,  Loretta Lynch Same as the Old Boss  The Attorney General nominees disturbing views on U.S. immigration law. My article included an excerpt from a Yahoo/AP news report, Attorney General nominee defends Obama immigration changes. Here is the exchange in which Lynch discussed the administrations immigrations policies Lynch said she had no involvement in drafting the measures but called them a reasonable way to marshal limited resources to deal with the problem of illegal immigration. She said the Homeland Security Department was focusing on removals of the most dangerous of the undocumented immigrants among us. Pressed by Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a leading immigration hardliner, she said citizenship was not a right for people in the country illegally but rather a privilege that must be earned. However, when Sessions asked whether individuals in the country legally or those who are here unlawfully have more of a right to a job, Lynch replied, The right and the obligation to work is one thats shared by everyone in this country regardless of how they came here. Sessions quickly issued a news release to highlight that response. Under later questioning by Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, Lynch clarified it, stating there is no right to work for an immigrant who has no lawful status. This was disturbing and telling, clearly Ms Lynchs views on immigration and likely, therefore on other issues are malleable and subject to revision if modifying her position is consistent with her personal goals. As Attorney General Lynch directs the operations of the entire Justice Department and all those who work for that department. Ms. Lynch must understand true democracy can only exist when justice is blind and totally objective. However, Lynch and the others who have fallen under Hillary Clintons corrupt sphere of influence are trapped in Hillarys web of deception, having fallen victim to the Hillary Virus. Throughout Clintons many decades in American politics, this highly contagious and virulent malady has proven to be virtually ineradicable. It is not likely to change no matter the outcome of the next election.",hate
"Potentially the Worst VP in American History A look at Tim Kaines track record and agendas. November 4, 2016 Discover The Networks During his years as a student at Harvard Law School in the early 1980s, Tim Kaine took a year off from his legal studies in order to work with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras. During the nine months he spent there, Kaine developed a keen interest in the teachings of local priests who were adherents of liberation theology , which is essentially Marxism dressed up as Christianity. Kaine himself embraced liberation theology and later claimed that it had changed him and deepened him. After completing his legal education, Kaine joined a civil litigation firm and practiced law for 17 years. He also launched a career in local politics in the mid1990s, and eventually went on to serve as governor of Virginia 200610 and as a U.S. senator 2013present. This past July, Hillary Clinton named Kaine as her vice presidential running mate. Over the course of his political career, Kaine has developed some noteworthy ties to a number of Islamist individuals and organizations In his role as Virginias governor in 2007, Kaine appointed Esam Omeish, president of the Muslim Brotherhood affiliated Muslim American Society MAS, to Virginias Immigration Commission. Omeish had previously served as president of the National Muslim Students Association and as a board member of the Islamic Society of North America , both of which have deep ties to the Brotherhood. Omeish had also been a board chairman of the Islamic Center of Passaic County , a New Jersey mosque with significant terrorist connections. And he had been a vice president and board member of the Dar alHijrah Islamic Center , a Virginia mosque whose imams have included, among others, an AlQaeda operative and a supporter of suicide bombings. Prior to his appointment by Kaine, Omeish had described the Muslim Brotherhood as a moderate organization he had praised the former Hamas leader Ahmed Yassin as our beloved Sheikh and he had pledged to lend his assistance to those Palestinians who understood that the jihad way is the way to liberate your land. In May 2007, Kaine was the keynote speaker at the Muslim American Society Freedom Foundations Standing for Justice Dinner. In 2010, Kaine agreed to attend the Dar alHijrah Islamic Centers annual fundraising banquet. In September 2011, Kaine spoke at an event that presented a Lifetime Achievement Award to U.S. Muslim Brotherhood leader Jamal Barzinji , who was closely associated with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad , Hamas, and the extremist International Institute of Islamic Thought IIIT. In 201112, Kaines U.S. Senate campaign received 4,300 from officials of the Islamic Society of North America and the Council on AmericanIslamic Relations , plus another 3,500 from IIITs presidentoffinance , Hisham AlTalib . In early 2015, Kaine objected strenuously when Republican House Speaker John Boehner invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to speak to the U.S. Congress about the gravity of the growing Iranian nuclear threat and his Netanyahus  profound disagreement  with the negotiated deal that the Obama Administration was pursuing with Iran. Kaine joined seven other Senate Democrats in boycotting Netanyahus speech. That summer, Kaine declared himself a  strong supporter  of the final agreement, which allowed the Islamist regime in Tehran to enrich uranium, build advanced centrifuges, purchase ballistic missiles, fund terrorism, and be guaranteed of having a nearzero breakout time to the development of a nuclear bomb approximately a decade down the road. In May 2015, Kaine was one of fourteen U.S. senators who wrote a letter to President Barack Obama urging him to allow 65,000 people from wartorn, terrorismravaged Syria into the United States as refugees, despite many peoples concern that terrorists could potentially infiltrate the refugee program. Later that same year, Kaine opposed a bill passed by the House of Representatives that would have required more careful vetting of Syrians and Iraqis before they could be admitted to the United States as refugees. These refugees are people who are terrorized, not terrorists, Kaine said in a November 2015 interview wherein he claimed that the refugee vetting process is one of the safest areas that we have. In a speech on the Senate floor the following month, Kaine said I look at this refugee crisis as a test  about whether we, like the biblical Job, will be true to our principles or whether well abandon them. He also urged his fellow legislators to emulate the example of the 17thcentury Indians down near Jamestown Island who had helped starving English settlers to survive by offering an extension of a hand to strangers in a strange land. Kaine ranks among the most leftwing political figures in the United States today. He is the only person with a 0 Lifetime Rating from the American Conservative Union, which has graded Members of Congress on their voting records each year since 1971. Similarly, ConservativeReview.com gives Kaine a 0 rating. In short, Tim Kaine is essentially a political mirror image of Hillary Clinton. Mrs. Clinton picked him as her running mate because she saw him as someone who could effectively help her implement a radical leftist agenda.",hate
"NBCs Baghdad Bob There Is No FBI Investigation of Hillary November 4, 2016 Daniel Greenfield Remember when Hillary Clinton was insisting that there was no FBI investigation of her, just a security review, even when the FBI rejected that claim Well Andrea Mitchell, NBCs own Baghdad Bob, isnt giving up that claim so easily. Even while the rest of the Clinton clique is screeching against the FBI for investigating Hillary like bats from the nether regions of leftwing hell, Mitchell is sticking to the old spin. There is no FBI investigation of Hillary . Close your eyes and say it three times. The FBI is not investigating Hillary. Its not. Its not. In a complete state of denial on Thursday, MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell interrupted live coverage of Donald Trump speaking at a Florida campaign rally to supposedly factcheck the candidate for citing a bombshell report that the FBI was conducting an extensive investigation into Hillary Clintons email and charitable foundation scandals. Mitchell refused to accept reality Just a lot of factchecking to do. Shes not under criminal investigation. In fact, its not an investigation. Its just a review of the emails. She did not lie to the FBI, according to James Comey. There was no grounds to prosecute her. So there are no lies, theres no criminality. She fretted I dont know even where to start....but I mean, we have to put it in some context. The context is that defending Hillary Clinton has become a mental illness. But as I wrote earlier this week, fact checking has become a media term for insisting on the primacy of its alternate reality even when it flies in the face of actual reality. There is no FBI investigation of Hillary. Anyone who believes that is probably some sort of rightwinger who listens to what the FBI actually says, rather than what NBC says that the FBI says. ",hate
"Muslims Terrorize Hindus Because Its Wednesday November 4, 2016 Daniel Greenfield The official media narrative is that Muslims are the worlds greatest victims. The truth, especially in majority Muslim countries, is rather strikingly different . Crowds of Muslims attacked Hindu homes and temples in eastern Bangladesh this week, raising concerns that the authorities are not taking steps to curb rising religious tensions. Attacks on Hindus are not unusual in Bangladesh, but it is rare to see multiple crowds targeting temples in an organized way as they did on Sunday and Monday. Note the casual language of the Times. Muslim religious violence is commonplace in Bangladesh. Its just not common for it to be happening on this scale. But how could it be otherwise Islam is structurally xenophobic, violently bigoted and racist down to its origins. Islams faith is expressed in a violent campaign against nonMuslims. This is Jihad. Muslims attacking Hindus, Christians, Jews, Yazidis or any other group That just means it must be Wednesday. Or any other day of the week. On Sunday, hundreds of Muslims entered a Hindu neighborhood, where they ransacked 15 temples and the homes of more than 100 families, Mr. Deb said. He said that the mob used long, hard sticks and locally made sharp weapons to assault Hindus they found there, and that at least 20 people, including a priest, were wounded.

"Obama Should Just Pardon Hillary for Every Conceivable Crime November 4, 2016 Dont look now, but #PardonHer talk is growing. Just as the Clinton campaign and its media allies rage against the FBI, some are looking for a pardon solution. And a way to spin that pardon as something other than a straight admission of guilt. How about political reconciliation and a way to defy those mean Republicans and take the issue of all the crimes that Hillary committed off the table Here you go. It does not take much clairvoyance to predict that Clintons most strident opponents may seek to extend the use criminal investigations as a political tactic to undermine her presidency if she wins the election next week. That prospect triggers a startling idea Should President Barack Obamasimply pardon Clinton if she wins the election... A presidential pardon could short circuit some of this maneuvering. The Constitution gives the president the power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, and it could be used here. The public is aware of the allegations against Clinton, yet she has continued to lead in election polls. If voters choose her for the presidency, their decision that the allegations are not disqualifying deserves respect. A presidential pardon could ratify that assessment. Yes, but what should Obama pardon Hillary Clinton for Corruption, bribery, abuse of classified information How about everything. Lets just print up a list of every possible crime and pardon Hillary for all of them. It would save time, energy and raise Hillary above the law. It would be a clear statement that she could get away with murder. Literally.",hate
"During the height of the Cold War, the CIA attempted to develop mind control techniques with the MKULTRA program. As it happens, the Communists already had a leg up on them. Well explore how this was done, along with some new twists.The criticism and selfcriticism technique in history This is what happens to people who joke about Chairman Mao ripping off Hillarys wardrobe.The technique of  criticism and selfcriticism  kritika i samokritika was developed during the early days of the Soviet Union . This got results. When the early Soviet show trials and purges took place, the targets would confess to committing treasonthe details stretching credulityand beg for execution. The Maoists Chinese Communists used it too, typically during  struggle sessions . Also, forced confessions were required in Vietnam for prisoners in reeducation camps .What happened wasnt much different from a medieval inquisition. Those targeted would be badgered until they confessed to whatever it was they supposedly did. Of course, physical forms of coercion were also an option. These werent actual trials their fates were already decided.The lucky ones were released and got to resume their lives as before, after their memorable reminder to toe the Party line. Others faced stiffer penalties than that from loss of Party membership and accompanying status all the way up to execution. No amount of compliance or abject groveling could save them if it was predetermined that they were going to be purged or killed.After the ordeal, survivors were surely scared witless. With their egos beaten down, they were ready to do as they were told without question. Its basically a form of brainwashing. As for those who were executed after that, the purpose of going through the motions was for benefit of the audience. It was political theater, convincing those present that they were delivering justice to wrongdoers, and serving as an example of what could happen to those who step out of line.Other than that, the criticism and selfcriticism techniquebadgering and forcing a confessionalso was picked up in the USA during the 1960s by certain cults and oddball encounter groups. Today, we might think of these strange and humiliating rituals as a thing of the past, but the truth is that theyve merely changed form . As Ive noted previously , cultural Marxism is a crappy and inherently destructive forexport variety of Communism, so its no great surprise that it has adapted this technique for its purposes.Modern witch hunts This is what happens to people who say that Bruce Jenner is actually a dude.When people are encouraged to become incensed over even tiny things , this causes a walking on eggshells atmosphere. In todays politically correct climate, its easy to run afoul of the Thought Police. This might result in a visit to the HR Department, or a campus speech code investigation. However, if the thoughtcrime is serious enoughor the target is prominent enoughthen this can ignite a media circus . Also, someone could end up featured on a mailing list for Social Justice Warriors . Besides just trolling and harassment, this can result in doxxing release of your personal information or pressure on an employer to fire the thought criminal.We in the Western world pride ourselves on the right to free speech. That was one of the main goals of liberalism, back in the 18th Century when liberalism was still a good thing. Actually, many free countries criminalize politically incorrect speech. Even in places that dont have legal penalties for speaking your mind, it carries the risk of the loss of your livelihood . This effectively makes entire policy arguments forbidden to articulate, which naturally is the whole point. Other goals, of course, are information control and thus thought control. So much for freedom of speech It took a few centuries, but liberals now oppose what they once stood for.The following scenario has happened time and again. Someone points out an inconvenient truth , writes something that offends someone, donates to the wrong cause, mocks a feminists First World problems , tells an offcolor joke , or even wears the wrong Tshirt . Then the feeding frenzy begins, resulting in torrents of criticism. Usually the target apologizes profusely, but loses his job no matter how abject or groveling his apologies are.Its possible to convince a judge and twelve jurors that youre not guilty of something, but good luck getting the media or an online SJW mob to calm down and leave you alone The traditional Communist session was better in one way. That is, they quit after breaking the targets will. A modern feeding frenzy, though, can drag on for months, even after the target has been begging for forgiveness. What goes on the Internet can stay there forever, including lies about you.If you get caught in a Social Justice Weenie witch hunt , never apologize. Explain and clarify if you absolutely must. This is for the benefit of the uncommitted the SJWs will already have made up their small minds about you and wont stop no matter what you do. Never let them break your frame Instead, go on the attack. You have a right to your own opinion and to express it.If you beg for their forgiveness, then you will be allowing them to turn their criticism into your selfcriticism. Remember that groveling is unlikely to save you Apologies are for people who actually did something wrong. Having a difference of opinion isnt wrong, despite some peoples curious notions about freedom of speech.Here are some other particulars to rememberYou cant reason with them  online mobs dont know you and have been told that youre an evildoer. Youll probably never know exactly what was said about you, who said it, and what email list all that was on. If you do find out, sue for defamation of character. However, you can be sure that youve already been deemed guilty. Theyre not interested in the truth. SJWs have great difficulty comprehending basic logic. Many of them dont even believe in objective reality  only their feelings are real to them. Why would the truth matter to these idiots Finally, Social Justice Weenies are a bunch of losers . Their opinion of you matters less than that of a snotty child cursing you out. Therefore, dont let these oxygenwasters mess with your selfesteem. Societal criticism and selfcriticism Wallowing in guilt at its finestThe Frankfurt School , a Communist think tank that moved to the USA and began subverting the educational system, developed critical theory . One of their top classics was Eros and Civilization by Herbert Marcuse. It contained lots of Freudian arguments on how our society was too repressed and we needed to loosen up our morals. Another was The Authoritarian Personality by Theodor Adorno. That too contained Freudian mumbojumbo, smearing right wing politics with accusations of neurosis and homo Daddy issues. All told, they wrote dozens of books along those lines, some attacking Western civilization directly. These vaporings wouldnt have amounted to much, if they hadnt become trendy in academia and influenced the 1960s zeitgeist.Meanwhile, radical feminismthe Second Wavewas starting up. This too had lots of Communist influence , another front of cultural Marxism. This also was all about criticism of our culture. This caused friction between the sexes, driving a wedge deep into the heart of society. The results included the snarky, snotty, and spoiled attitudes youve surely encountered. Worse, this caused untold misery from high divorce rates and broken homes .This was one of several movements that became prominent during the 1960s and are still with us today. Surely you can think of many others. The methodology was the sameall angrily made overblown complaints about how bad society has been to them. The way they tell it, theyre out fighting for their rights. The goal of cultural Marxism, though, was all about attacking our morale and softening us up. The people involved in those movements were merely tools, being used by leaders who were in it for power, money, and status.The educational system has been dumbed down . History has been rewritten too. Figures like Christopher Columbus and the US Founding Fathers are bad guys now. Even as early as the 1980s, campuses were hellbent in purging DWEMs their charming term for dead White European males from the literary canon. None of this was really about inclusiveness its all about robbing our people of our heritage, making us ashamed of our accomplishments, and destroying our resolve.The propaganda is everywhere. Television is full of social and political messages, even in shows for children , and piggybacked onto advertisements too. Sensitivity training courses deliver politically correct indoctrination. College campuses are notorious for pushing propaganda. This even happens to elementary school kids. My first exposure was in second grade. Some of the indoctrination exercises require audience participation, such as forcing them to fill out privilege checklists with the facts cherrypicked  to instill a sense of collective guilt.All this has worked according to plan. Many are out of touch with their roots, and dont understand that they have a heritage worth preserving. Worse, others have been infected by guilt trips. Sometimes this leads to public spectacles of wallowing in guilt again, theres the selfcriticism part.The antidote to this is the truth. The fact is, every civilization has its good points and its bad points, and ours is no exception. Its rotten hypocrisy for the bullshit merchants in academia and the media to dwell on our faults and overlook those of other parts of the world, while selectively ignoring our accomplishments and elevating those of others . The truth is that none of our shortcomings or misdeeds are solely found in Western civilization, but some of our good characteristics are indeed unique.You can protect your children by home schooling them or sending them to a private school where they wont be indoctrinated. You can always get rid of your TV too. Meanwhile, though, millions of other students will be putty in the hands of propagandizing professors and teachers, and of course the lying media. Those pushing this from the top down must be called out, exposed, and removed from power.Read More 13 Common SJW Arguments And How to Dismantle Them ",hate

"At the third debate, Donald Trump was asked if he would accept the results of the election. Trump responded that he would have to look at the process to determine if everything was done fairly before he could accept it. The media went berserk claiming that Trump was undermining democracy. But is the US system really rigged And if it is, can Trump overcome itWhy rig the system The elite realize that their time is short.Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. Revelation 1212It is human nature to want to accumulate wealth. It is also human nature to want to keep what you have. One of the ways that the wealthy do that is through influencing the political process to ensure it is favorable to them. A democratic republic is particularly easy to influence. The wealthy elite can buy candidates through donations to them or to their superpacs. They can make voting patterns more favorable to them by changing the countrys demographics. Or they can influence voters through the supposedly unbiased news media that they control. In the US, the wealthy elite use every one of these levers to rig the system.For example, liberal voters often favor a progressive tax system where high earners pay greater percentages than those who earn less. It sounds like a populist policy but it is not. Progressive taxation is put in place to prevent middle class people from rising into the ranks of the truly wealthy who have already accumulated their wealth and are taxed at the much lower capital gains rate. Progressive taxation keeps the rich on top and keeps the plebs down. Thats why no matter which political party is in power, we are still stuck with progressive taxation.Everything goes well as long as both parties dont rock the boat. But once you get a true wildcard like Trump, the system must spring into action to stop the threat to the established order. Thats what we are seeing now. The elite are using every tool in the arsenal of the rigged system to ensure Trump does not upset their gravy train. The elite sense their time is short.Voter Fraud The first way in which the election is rigged is through voter fraud. In his Gettysburg address, Trump outlined some of the ways in which this occursAccording to Pew, there are 24 million voter registrations that in the US that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate. 1.8 million dead people are registered to vote, and some of them are voting. I wonder how that happens 2.8 million people are registered to vote in more than one state. These are numbers folks. These are numbers. 14 of noncitizens are registered to vote.Liberals always object to any sort of voter identification requirement. They say that it negatively affects minority voters, who may not have any identification. But this is obvious nonsense. The real reason liberals oppose voter identification is because it would make voter fraud more difficult.By raising concerns about voter fraud, Trump is firing a warning shot. He is saying that he will fight voter fraud, unlike prior GOP candidates who preferred defeat to calling out cheating by the other side. Simply putting the Democrats on notice may cause them to cheat less than they would have otherwise. The only question is whether Trump will be able to muster enough votes to overcome the amount of cheating that will take place.The Lgenpresse A second way that the system is rigged is through the legacy news media. These include the three oldest television news networks ABC, CBS, NBC as well as the newer ones CNN, MSNBC, Fox. It also includes the remaining newspapers, especially the New York Times, Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal. Of these, the only ones that are reliably conservative are Fox and the WSJ, both of which are owned by Rupert Murdock. But even here, it is more accurate to call Fox and the WSJ neoliberal rather than conservative as they both push the globalist message of open borders and unenforced trade.Trump is very media savvy. Hes been in the public eye since the 1980s and his philosophy has been that no publicity is bad publicity. Trump has used this to highlight his policies. By making controversial statements, he has been able to force the media to cover his positions. Still, the nonstop smear campaign has hurt Trumps numbers particularly among older voters who still get their news from legacy sources.New media outlets like Return of Kings, Breitbart, and Danger  Play have been more favorable to Trump but the most highly funded new media such as Daily Beast, Heat Street, Buzzfeed, and Huffington Post all push the globalist message. The end result that Trump is fighting an ocean of disinformation with only a handful of allies by his side.Voter Discouragement Fivethirtyeight doing its best to discourage Trump voters.Another way that that system is rigged is that the legacy media conspires to discourage Trump voters from going to the polls. One way they do this is to over poll Democrats to make it look like Trump is losing. For example, one recent poll placed Hillary 12 points higher than Trump. But even Obama was only able to beat McCain by 7 points even though he was packing stadiums of 70,000 people. And Hillary doesnt command the sort of adulation that Obama did in 2008.There is a huge motivation gap between Trump and Clinton. Recently, Trump held a rally in Tampa where 28,000 people showed up. Some of these people waited in line for 12 hours for the chance to see Trump. A day later, Hillary hosted a rally in Florida where only 1000 people showed up. And some of those were likely paid plants. Her running mate Tim Kaine did even worse barely getting 30 people to show up for one of his events.One day before the Brexit vote, polls showed Remain leading by 10 points. Leave ended up winning by 3.5 points.Why does the legacy media report polls that show Trump losing by a landslide Because it is designed to dishearten Trump voters.Conclusion Will Trump be able to overcome the rigged system It will be a heroic achievement if he does. One thing is certain This is not the time to give up but to fight with all of our might. The elites want us to be discouraged, to give up hope, to lie down and die. That is the one thing we will never do. Even if the host of hell rise up to oppose you, go to the ballot box on November 8th. Regardless of what you may hear otherwise, your life will be very different under President Trump than it will be under globalist pawn Hillary.Win or lose, our battle to bring back the patriarchy will not end on November 8 th . A Trump victory would give us breathing room to start restoring our society in the open. A Hillary victory, heaven forbid, would signal that our work will need to be underground. Either way, our battle is just beginning. In future columns I will outline the way forward for traditional men.Read More Did George Soros Rig The Utah Vote To Help Ted Cruz Defeat Donald Trump ",hate
"Last week I expounded the idea that we should take the time to ponder about emotions . These matter much in prompting us to take action or not to, to think about something or not to. Sustained emotional states can lead us to pedestalize girls, ignore our own needs, or refraining from caring about our own interests, whereas others push theirs every day. They can also allow said girls to go shamelessly after shortterm pleasure, or be complacent to rapefugees while shrieking and fingerwaving against men of their own kin.Pondering passions and emotions does not mean getting led by them at the expense of critical thinking. Rather, it is the exact opposite, as it allows us to spot the shrewd ones who want to push our emotional buttons, as well as being freer to take more thoughtful and actually less emotiondetermined actions. Once we have gained awareness of passions, we can decide which ones we want to stimulate and why.Following this idea, I made some suggestions of how and in whom we could stir positive emotions such empathy, hope, and love. Today I will do the same with four other passions or emotions admiration, shame, humility, and fear.1. Admiration Society, I think, should admit some victimhood to those who were raised as weaklings or acted cluelessly out of good intentions. Women in particular should be more empathetic and nurturing towards nice and beta malesas long as their empathy does not extent out of admitted boundarieshence taking an opposite direction from the egotistical, uncaring orientation a lot of them currently harbor. Of course, this should not equate to validating too much the unhealthy, unmanly men women should also be trained into validating more manlier men. And here admiration comes into play.As Nassim Taleb put it, we are living more and more in an extremistan where those at the highest level take the lions share while the resources diminish quickly down the ladder. Girls today tend to admire only the most famous or highstatus people, which leads them to despise the ninetynine per cent. This exasperated hypergamy should be tamed so that the average man, as long as he achieves the minimum and/or is upstanding and dutiful, gets his fair share. A more democratic but still conditional distribution of girls admiration would reward actual good behaviour for men and decrease the intramasculine competition .Girls should also admireand not mockproper feminine role models. Upstanding mothers, females taking proper care of themselves and so on ought to be at least esteemed by the average girl.2. Shame Shame arises from measuring our actions against moral standards and discovering that they fall short. If our actions fall short and we fail to notice, we can be shamed or made to notice Shame is normally accentuated if its object is exposed, but, unlike embarrassment, also attaches to a thought or action that remains undisclosed and undiscoverable to others. Neel Burton, Heaven and Hell , chap.4, p.38A particularly strong emotion, shame usually comes as a blow, makes one lose face or composure, to eventually feel guilt or remorse. Just like other strong emotions, it has been used with consumed malignancy by the Left.Leftists created a narrative where whites are held entirely responsible for dreadful historical phenomena such as slavery, the Holocaust, an oppression of minority groups, or racism. As these phenomena are constantly talked about and expanded, whites are also supposed to feel a correspondingly boundless guilt. The sheer power of guilt can explain why so many whites have been afraid to stand up being shamed as a racist or Nazi can be enough to endure rejection from ones family, lose reputation and employment.Shame can be aroused through two levers the standards one agrees with, and ones purported responsibility. Both levers have been skillfully used to un shame the liberalfavored groups. As for the standards, feminists attacked what they called slutshaming while also shaming relentlessly manly behavior, and as for the responsibility, pretty much all those who claim to identify with a minority tend to deny all by slipping it over the majoritys shoulders.This is how you get persistent offenders or Jihadi families expressing neither shame nor remorse, whereas the productive, working, and normally sociable person gets nagged for being white. In the Current Year, better be a true rapist who can evade responsibility and shame by invading Europe than a young virgin of European descent.What we should do here sounds pretty obvious in theory though it will be much harder to carry on in practice, as people evidently hate being shamed, especially when they have been accustomed of blaming everything on the others.Shame the fatties , shame the arrogant snowflakes whose unwillingness to respect is all too obvious, recall the selfdetermination of antiwhite liberals and criminals. They all made free choices. They should carry all associated responsibility.As for us, we must keep our face straight, never make clueless concessions to skillful framers or hysterical SJWs. If they appeal to moral standards, put forth your own as legitimate. If they appeal to your purported actions or responsibility, emphasize theirsand how it cannot be boiled down to external factors.Even dogs and cats are considered responsible by their caretakers so they can be punished for bad behaviours and learn likewise, granting certain people or groups a constant deresponsabilization amounts to give them a free pass for destroying everything. Criminals of said groups have agency, and the liberals who gave them a pass to plunder and kill whitey are responsible as well.Shame can also arise from being associated with something or someone deemed as despicable. The liberal policy of distinguishing sharply between terrorists and documented aliens, in spite of how much the latter to house the former, allows for the latter going without shame even when they are closely associated with terroristswhereas every white is threatened with shame if he has a ist or phobic acquaintance.Turn the table. Shake off the burden from the disenfranchised majority, and put it back on those who have been acting with impunity for too long.3. Humility Current Year girls overinflated ego is enough, notwithstanding economic or racial factors, to explain a host of social problems. Blinded by it, girls ignore how much they are determined by their own cravings, shortterm desires, or by the latest fashions around. They drink loads of booze, fuck with random strangers, reframe their story as a rape later so they can blame it all on the guy . They never learn to cook, clean, take care of something else than their Instagram account and corporate career. Speaking of corporate isnt it striking that so many men are badly in need of employment, sex, and have almost nothing, whereas spoiled corporate drones believe they can havetakeit allEgo makes one lose any sense of proportion or balance. It leads to complacency, merciless exploitation of others, refusal to take responsibility, and open despise.Augustine of Hippo wrote that humility was at the foundation of all other virtues. This makes sense. If ones ego is inflated, one does not feel the need to practice virtues and feels entitled to never be ashamed of her shortcomingsthat are easily denied or blamed on someone else. Ego also leads to wasting resources on luxury, parce que je le vaux bien , as says a famous brand of cosmetics, instead of focusing on selfimprovement or caretaking.Though girls should be the first to have their ego smashed, as the survival of basic family units depends on it, bloated ego is a general disease in our age. Men too can be sold the idea that, say, being a smug urban elf is a proof that one sides with progress and civilization whereas they are actually weak, dependent and unable to fix anything by themselves. Its not all about our individual selves.4. Fear Readers asked for it, so, here it is. Fear is a very powerful emotion, to the point of prompting one to freeze, flee, abandon a previously planned course of action, or never even think to consider an idea or an action. The Left has been using it in two different, albeit complementary, ways.First, it has constantly accused conservatives to play on fears, implying irrational or unjustified fears, when they dared to ask serious questions or making realistic assessment. When the 1965 Immigration Act was voted, democrat senators pretended that opening up the borders would not change the ethnic mix of America and that any suspicion it might happen was highly emotional. In France, the socialists and mainstream righters alike have been carrying the same accusations. Here the Left accused any doubt to be a hint of unjustified and intolerable fear.Well, what happened since Doesnt it look like every fear from the right was justifiedespecially since the postWW2 Right has always been incredibly wary, not to say coward, when it came to criticize the Lefts moral high groundSecond, the Left has also been keen on doing exactly what it accused the conservatives to do, namely, stirring fear about political bogeymen. Liberals invented rape culture or patriarchal oppression when men actually became weaker. They associated to Nazism any white person who assumes his race should basically survive. They shamelessly bludgeoned whom they could call white supremacists as if defending ones right to live in peace against hordes of thugs and violent parasites was equal to being Hitler himself.Whites were led to fear their own supposed authoritarian tendencies, as the shrewd Jews who intrigued through the Frankfurt school put it see Kevin MacDonald, Culture of Critique , chap.5. Whites were led to fear some of their fearsbetter have ones daughter killed by Muslims than expressing concerns about them to other whites, because racism is so evil, boo.When I was younger, I noticed the local thugs had a huge advantage over us normal people they were much more fearless. They had this devilmaycare, provocative attitude, which made them potentially dangerous to the bourgeois prude beta male and attractive to females. Not incidentally, the first movie of the French essayist Alain Soral Confessions dun dragueur Confessions of a Womanizer shows a young Arab with decent pickup experience taking a young middleclass white boy under his wing as to help him escape from virginity.Feeling fear is a necessary step in life. Fear appears greatly useful when there is something to flee from or watch as a potential hazard, but being too fearful or afraid of the wrong things can be a serious liability. Never trust a liberal who either points finger at you for being fearful or tries to paint you as dangerous and justifying his own fearmongering.On the flip side, being feared by others is not always a negative. Some people need to be afraid to respect you if you try to treat them correctly or let free rein to your innate generosity, they will harm and exploit you. Such people, just as everyone around who may be tempted to disrespect, should be kept in check by a minimal fear. Better be feared and respected than getting tread upon.Conclusion Frame and un frame whatever matters when you have to, as you have to. The left cursed us by locking us into an always negative framing when we fail, whatever the reason, we are despised as weak or losers, and when we succeed they say we are privileged and oppressive. In both cases, the chosen framing leads to negative emotions associated to us no matter what we actually do .Fortunately, it is always possible to turn the tables, provided we keep a tight frame, and change these emotions as well. For example, when we are weak, we should elicit empathy, be noticed for our good intentions or noble infirmities, and when we are strong, we should elicit admiration and trust.Think, frame, feel positive about us and about what we do. Get rid of those who wont.Read Next 3 Emotions Men Should Master ",hate

"Home This Month Popular 4 Reasons Why Your Diet Sucks 4 Reasons Why Your Diet Sucks March 2, 2013 19 Comments Body 1. You have no idea how much you are eating. Ever wonder why you cant gain any muscle or lose any body fat Well, the first place to look for the answer is your diet. Are you eating the requisite amount of calories for your goals If you want to gain muscle you have to eat more calories than you burn, whereas if you want to lose body fat you have to eat fewer calories than you burn. There is no way around this simple fact. Even though this is nothing more than a grade school physics problem, Im still baffled by the number of guys out there whining about being hardgainers or endomorphs. Invest in a food scale and track your intake. Its really not that hard. 2. You are constantly looking for the next best supplement to take. This is the game equivalent of asking for the one magic pick up line that will allow you to swoop top shelf girls left and right. The hard truth is that the vast majority of supplements are a complete waste of money. Guys flock to supplements because its an easy fix. Instead of putting in the time and hard work needed to obtain the results they desire, they look for shortcuts in order to get ahead. Unfortunately, these shortcuts dont exist. The only time you should be worrying about supplements is when you have all of the other nutritional building blocks in place. 3. You think you dont have the time to eat healthy. A lot of guys complain about being too busy to eat nutritious meals made mostly of whole foods. Guys will also complain about not having enough time to hit the gym after work or during their lunch break. The problem here is not one of time , but rather of priorities . Guys would rather sleepin than get up early to make themselves a good lunch to take to work. The bottom line is this if you value your health then find the time to make yourself nutritious meals. Ditch the excuses. 4. You think there is one best diet for everyone Ive been in this game long enough to know that there is no one particular diet that is best for everyone. I remember about 10 years ago people were losing their minds over The Atkins Diet. About 5 years later people moved on to The Paleo Diet, and now Intermittent Fasting is all the rage. New diets will always be on the horizon, which pretty much guarantees that arguments on the internet about which diet is the best will never end. I do not know what the best diet is. What I do know is that all good diets have several things in common such as being based around whole foods, and acknowledging the importance of portion control, protein, fiber, and other important nutrients. Aside from these basics, whether you eat low carb or high carb, three meals a day or six meal, is entirely up to you and your lifestyle but make sure you get the basics down first. If you can get a handle on just these four areas of your nutrition you will be ahead of the vast majority of individuals out there.",hate
"The most interesting books of the Bible for those who arent believers in God are the wisdom books of Job and Ecclesiastes. Written from a philosophical point of view, they attempt to help people live with suffering and pain while putting existence into context.Book of Job Job is a devout believer in God who follows all of His rules. He has been blessed with incredible wealth and numerous children. Satan then challenges God by arguing that Job is only faithful because of what he has gained, and that he would immediately curse God if everything was taken away from him. God allows Satan to destroy him, taking his wealth and killing all of his children.Once the misfortune befalls Job, his wife implores him to curse God, but Job refuses. Instead, he openly laments at why God is allowing him to suffer. He even asks God to allow him to die.I would rather be strangledrather die than suffer like this.I hate my life and dont want to go on livingOh, leave me alone for my few remaining days. Job 71516Why make me your targetAm I a burden to youWhy not just forgive my sinand take away my guiltFor soon I will lie down in the dust and die.When you look for me, I will be gone. Job 72021What do you gain by oppressing meWhy do you reject me, the work of your own hands,while smiling on the schemes of the wicked Job 103He then has a series of poetic dialogues with priestly men in an attempt to explain Gods justice. Job asks some pointed questions, implying that those who are eager to sin seem to experience more prosperity than those who closely follow Gods words.The godless seem like a lush plant growing in the sunshine,its branches spreading across the garden.Its roots grow down through a pile of stonesit takes hold on a bed of rocks.But when it is uprooted,its as though it never existed Job 81618When a plague sweeps through,he laughs at the death of the innocent.The whole earth is in the hands of the wicked,and God blinds the eyes of the judges.If hes not the one who does it, who is Job 92324Just like how there are so many laws in the legal code that you are always on the hook for something illegal, there are also so many possible sins that it may be impossible to live a clean life.Whatever happens, I will be found guilty.So whats the use of tryingEven if I were to wash myself with soapand clean my hands with lye,you would plunge me into a muddy ditch,and my own filthy clothing would hate me. Job 92931The men that Job spills his guts to state that hes sinning in some way and knows nothing about how God works, and that he must grin and bear it instead of questioning Gods actions.Pay attention to this, Job.Stop and consider the wonderful miracles of GodDo you know how God controls the stormand causes the lightning to flash from his cloudsDo you understand how he moves the cloudswith wonderful perfection and skillWhen you are sweltering in your clothesand the south wind dies down and everything is still,he makes the skies reflect the heat like a bronze mirror.Can you do that Job 371418God appears and asks Job how dare he question His actions, even though those actions amounted to an agreement with Satan.Who is this that questions my wisdomwith such ignorant wordsBrace yourself like a man,because I have some questions for you,and you must answer them.Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earthTell me, if you know so much.Who determined its dimensionsand stretched out the surveying lineWhat supports its foundations,and who laid its cornerstoneas the morning stars sang togetherand all the angels shouted for joy Job 3827God goes on to describe his powers and then serves a How dare you argument to Job, who then accepts his utter impotence.Then the LORD said to Job,Do you still want to argue with the AlmightyYou are Gods critic, but do you have the answersThen Job replied to the LORD,I am nothinghow could I ever find the answersI will cover my mouth with my hand.I have said too much already.I have nothing more to say. Job 4025You asked, Who is this that questions my wisdom with such ignoranceIt is Iand I was talking about things I knew nothing about,things far too wonderful for me.You said, Listen and I will speakI have some questions for you,and you must answer them.I had only heard about you before,but now I have seen you with my own eyes.I take back everything I said,and I sit in dust and ashes to show my repentance. Job 4236Other parts of the Bible channel Job by asking why bad on Earth is allowed to continueWake up, O Lord Why do you sleepGet up Do not reject us forever.Why do you look the other wayWhy do you ignore our suffering and oppressionWe collapse in the dust,lying face down in the dirt.Rise up Help usRansom us because of your unfailing love. Psalm 442326And the usual response is to not question GodWhat sorrow awaits those who argue with their Creator.Does a clay pot argue with its makerDoes the clay dispute with the one who shapes it, saying,Stop, youre doing it wrongDoes the pot exclaim,How clumsy can you beHow terrible it would be if a newborn baby said to its father,Why was I bornor if it said to its mother,Why did you make me this way Isaiah 5910After Job stopped questioning God, he was rewarded with even greater prosperity than beforeSo the LORD blessed Job in the second half of his life even more than in the beginning. For now he had 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 teams of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys. He also gave Job seven more sons and three more daughters. He named his first daughter Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Kerenhappuch. In all the land no women were as lovely as the daughters of Job. And their father put them into his will along with their brothers. Job lived 140 years after that, living to see four generations of his children and grandchildren. Then he died, an old man who had lived a long, full life. Job 421217You have to be patient with GodThose who plant in tears will harvest with shouts of joy. They weep as they go to plant their seed, but they sing as they return with the harvest. Psalm 12656The lesson of this story seems to be one of stoicism accept your fate, dont question it, and understand that what you have now can be taken from you at a moments notice if God wants to, no matter how cleanly you have lived in his honor. Ironically, this book did more to make me question Gods wisdom than any other.Book Of Ecclesiastes The next wisdom book is Ecclesiastes, purportedly written by Kings David son, Solomon, who amassed onethousand wives during his reign as King of Israel. His wife collection led to him serving other gods, and he was punished for it when God broke up the Kingdom of Israel. Ecclesiastes is the book that Solomon wrote at the end of his life, sharing all that he learned.Everything is meaningless, says the Teacher, completely meaningless What do people get for all their hard work under the sun Generations come and generations go, but the earth never changes. The sun rises and the sun sets, then hurries around to rise again. The wind blows south, and then turns north. Around and around it goes, blowing in circles. Rivers run into the sea, but the sea is never full. Then the water returns again to the rivers and flows out again to the sea. Everything is wearisome beyond description. No matter how much we see, we are never satisfied. No matter how much we hear, we are not content. History merely repeats itself. It has all been done before. Nothing under the sun is truly new. Ecclesiastes 1211What is the point of accumulating wisdom in life Why work hardFor in much wisdom is much grief and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow. Ecclesiastes 118I thought, Wisdom is better than foolishness, just as light is better than darkness. For the wise can see where they are going, but fools walk in the dark. Yet I saw that the wise and the foolish share the same fate. Both will die. So I said to myself, Since I will end up the same as the fool, whats the value of all my wisdom This is all so meaningless For the wise and the foolish both die. Ecclesiastes 21316So what do people get in this life for all their hard work and anxiety Their days of labor are filled with pain and grief even at night their minds cannot rest. It is all meaningless. Ecclesiastes 22223All is vanityFor that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts even one thing befalleth them as the one dieth, so dieth the other yea, they have all one breath so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast for all is vanity. All go unto one place all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again. Ecclesiastes 31920Promiscuous and bad women are sent forth as a punishment from GodI discovered that a seductive woman is a trap more bitter than death. Her passion is a snare, and her soft hands are chains. Those who are pleasing to God will escape her, but sinners will be caught in her snare. Ecclesiastes 726Solomon tries to convince himself that evil will not prosper, but he cant help coming back to the fact that it doesWhen a crime is not punished quickly, people feel it is safe to do wrong. But even though a person sins a hundred times and still lives a long time, I know that those who fear God will be better off. The wicked will not prosper, for they do not fear God. Their days will never grow long like the evening shadows. And this is not all that is meaningless in our world. In this life, good people are often treated as though they were wicked, and wicked people are often treated as though they were good. This is so meaningless Ecclesiastes 81116At this moment, it seems that Solomon goes off the rails by seemingly promoting a life of debaucherySo I recommend having fun, because there is nothing better for people in this world than to eat, drink, and enjoy life. That way they will experience some happiness along with all the hard work God gives them under the sun. Ecclesiastes 815One interpretation of this is that if you live in sin like Solomon, you will eventually come to the conclusion that life is meaningless, all is for naught, and the only purpose is to have fun. The book may have been included in the Bible to serve as an example of what will happen to you if behave as Solomon and come to the end of your life thinking that it wasnt worth it. I hope this was the intended result because otherwise it would cause you to lose faith in Gods own wisdom in justice, just like with Job.The wisdom books of the Bible raise questions of Gods justice and plans for his human subjects. Why do people suffer or prosper Why does life feel like its not being guided by God These questions vexed the Jews enough that they honored other Gods to get more immediate results. And then Jesus Christ came along to say that it will all be worth itnot necessarily now, but in the eternal afterlife, as long as you accept him as your savior.Read More The Old Testaments Sexist Views On Female Behavior ",hate
"Ive been living in South East Asia for almost a decade now, and over that time Ive come to have a matured perspective on living here and a fair appreciation of the pros and cons of doing so. Like most people who come here, I set off thinking I was going to live in paradise. Thats far from the reality, let me tell youLiving in South East Asia has its pros and cons, just like anywhere else. While I myself have decided to return west for a while, Ill always have a connection to Asia and Im sure Ill be back many times throughout my life.So whats the REAL story with living in Asia Is it all its cracked up to be What does a man have to be aware of when coming here Lets look at six common stereotypical ideas about living in South East Asia, and assess them in the light of reality.1. Asian Women Are Kind, Gentle, And Compliant To Their Husbands So sweet Not so fast.This is, most definitely, a myth, and if you come out here expecting to find some little house pet who does your bidding, youll be in for a rude awakening.Its definitely true that Asian women, in my experience, are a lot more traditional. They give the man his place in the house, rarely question your final decisions, and do not resent housework and basic wifely duties.However, the idea that theyll just do whatever you tell them without question is nonsense. Theyre human beings with a will of their own and you wouldnt be the first guy to get a smack in the head from a fivefoottwo broad who weighs 90 pounds if you disrespect her.The idea that Asian women are some sort of angelic alternative to Western women is also nonsense. While its not the norm, Ive met several Western men who have been taken to the cleaners by their Asian wives and girlfriends. When you move here, youre completely at her mercy and you will never have any legal rights as a citizen.Asian women generally are a lot more traditional, but this stereotype that theyre some sort of perfect wife material has got to go. Theyre individualsand there are all kinds, good and bad, among them.Read this guide to dating Asian women for a more complete perspective on the issue. Its a thorny subject, and theres a lot of misunderstanding surrounding it.2. Asia Is Ridiculously Cheap This is one Id have to lean slightly towards agreeing with.Most things in Asia are a lot cheaper. Eating out for my entire family often costs less than 15, meaning I can afford to do it basically every day. My rent for a condo apartment costs less than 150 a month, although thats mostly because I live in the sticks and am not in a major city.A general rule of thumb is that outside of major cities like Bangkok, Singapore, and KL, you can divide the cost of living by three and get a rough estimate.Note, this does not apply to consumer goods such as cars and electrical appliances, which are in and around the same price. It certainly does not apply to luxury goods, which are often much more expensive because of the taxes placed on them by local governments.Asia is cheaper overall, but anything other than the basics costs roughly the same. Life in South East Asia CAN be cheaper, but it isnt necessarily soit depends on your lifestyle.3. You Can Become A Citizen Of An Asian Country And Stay Forever Becoming a citizen in an Asian country is nigh on impossible. Even if you could, you probably wouldnt want to.You can get a variety of visas like permanent residency, and each country aims to facilitate the spouses of their nationals and, especially, retirees with proven cash in the bank. However, youll not become a CITIZEN with all of the various rights they enjoy.Its also worth noting while you might get permanent residence, youll never be one of them. Even if you live here for 30 years, you will always be a foreigner and will be viewed as such by locals. This has pros and cons to it, but youll never quite feel at home and accepted as one of the group.Youll get undue respect from some for being a Westerner, but forget about talking politics or leveling criticisms at the way things are doneyoull be met with hostility and resentment for the latter.4. The Weather In Asia Is 24/7 Sunshine The weather in South East Asia is generally pretty awesome, and you can live an outdoors life youll truly enjoy if youre that type.The sun shines almost every day, and even when its overcast its warm, meaning you can go out and about and do anything from walk on the beach to shop in the city.However, when the storms come, youd better be prepared to get your ass inside. The rainfall and wind in many countries in South East Asia is truly terrifying. Just switch on any news station the next time a major storm hits the Philippines and youll see what its like.Thankfully, after 1.5 years of living in the Philippines , Ive never been caught directly in a major storm, although Ive seen the tail end of plenty of them.The weather is good when its good, and utterly awful when its bad. Check this clip out to see how bad it can get5. Asia Is 100 Years Behind The West In Terms Of Development This is a stereotype thats deeply mistaken, and whether or not its true depends on which country you go to.True, countries like Laos and Bangladesh are miles behind any Western nation, but head to Singapore and youll be shocked by how far ahead of us they are in terms of tech and development.Asia is developing at breakneck pace, and with that development comes super highways, skytrains, skyscrapers and everything else we usually associate with an advanced country. It wont be long before many countries out here catch up and surpass the West, although it is definitely true that most of them are slightly behind for now.Theres a phenomenon called leapfrogging which virtually guarantees Asian countries will catch up to and surpass the West quickly. Leapfrogging is when they can skip all of the evolution and development and simply emulate modern day technology developed elsewherea great example is India, where they have skipped the transition from dialup to mobie internet and gone straight from nothing to mobile.If you think this cant be done and there are intellectual property laws to protect tech from being stolen wholesale, I salute you, but I have to laugh. There are no such laws, and even if there were, nobody would bother to enforce them.On the other hand, you still have many scenes like this outside your window when you get out of the main cities6. Asians Are Extremely Family Oriented Again, this is one I lean towards agreeing with. There are exceptions to every rule, but the family unit is extremely strong in Asia, especially countries like the Philippines.I dont want to wax lyrical or speculate as to why this is. Its enough to acknowledge it as a fact and accept that its the case. 90 of the Asian people I have ever met and gotten to know from Indonesia to the Philippines to Thailand are devoted to their families to the extent that wed consider it cultlike in most Western countries.I pass no judgment on this whatsoever. It can be a great thing or a bad thing, depending on your own perspective. I personally like it and think its something weve lost in many European countries, and America, too.This is an idea about Asia I agree withthe dedication to family above individuality is definitely true, and so by default if you get into a relationship with an Asian woman, be prepared for this.The family unit is the sun around which everything orbits in most Asian countries.Living In Asia Summary Sorry to disappoint you, fellas, but you wont find paradise in South East Asia.What you will find is a place with many opportunities, pitfalls, pros and cons, but which I do not regret living in for a single second and which has come to be a large part of my lifes story.I came out for a year and stayed for almost a decade. However, Ive decided that time is now over and its time to go home.Id love to hear about your experiences living or traveling in Asia. Do you find my perceptions to be accurate, or do you have a different viewRead More Why Western Men Prefer Foreign Women Over Their Own ",hate
"Home This Month Popular 5 Ridiculously Stupid Things Men Keep Doing For Women 5 Ridiculously Stupid Things Men Keep Doing For Women David G. Brown David is a lifelong dissident and intellectual rebel. He despises political correctness, which replaces real, needy victims with narcissistic leftists out for a free meal. Though still a young man, he has watched society descend into its present morass with great sadness, combined with a determination to help make things better. He tweets when theres something worth tweeting here . October 28, 2016 Girls Forget the movies that set aloof men against loveseeking women. It is men who are the hopeless romantics much, if not most of the time. And they express this extraordinary naivety by engaging in stupid behaviors that their fathers and other male role models should have beaten out of them. Though feminism, demographic trends, and socioeconomic realities encourage women to be entitled prima donnas, men add to the feedback loop by rewarding modernday princesses. Of course, there are sensible exceptions to avoiding the following behaviors. A time and a place, for example, can be found for defending a woman, most notably your mother or wife, from someone elses verbal or physical attack. Likewise, sometimes emergencies or certain serious events mean you should put your priorities aside to help a highquality woman who gives longterm value to your life. That said, in the vast majority of cases acting in this way is unnecessary, timeconsuming, resourcedraining, and plain selfdestructive for a man. So, here are the five things many men perversely and uselessly keep doing for women 1. Fighting for them I lost count long ago of the number of times I have seen a man step in to save a woman from either herself or a slight usually deserved against her. A girl will behave like a pork chop at a restaurant, club or elsewhere, picking a verbal or even physical argument with an employee or fellow patron. Along comes CaptainSaveaHo, who might not even know the girl, to protect her honor. The expectation of many women that men will do this for them is bad enough, let alone when a man does it of his own volition, without being requested. In return for risking a physical or similar altercation with other people, the white knight invariably gets a smile, a few words, and perhaps a phone number. From this point onwards, though, the interaction between Mr. White Knight and the Entitled Damsel Who Causes Her Own Distress invariably fizzles out. And it is not just members of your typical white knight crowd who act this way. Men who are nominally good with women fall into this trap, too, confusing it with the opportunity to be alpha and dominate over another male. The most common outcome, sadly, is that a womans very poor behavior is condoned by a man falling over himself to be her medieval champion. 2. Fighting over them Not only is this bickering usually illadvised, it is often exactly what she wants. This stupid behavior is only marginally better than fighting for women and the two activities consistently overlap. Whilst competition in life, including between men over women, should be largely encouraged, swathes of men are effectively scrapping over last Sundays leftovers on a Saturday, three days after the refrigerator stopped working. Remember a woman can be attractive but, because of her attitude and behavior, have very little longterm value for you. Countless men live with the illusion that if they toil hard enough to get the goodlooking girl, it must be worth it. Thats simply not the case in modern times. To boot, a lot of sexually thirsty men nowadays are chasing physically lowyield women their fathers and grandfathers would never have noticed. At best, the majority of men who fight over women are dueling over the prospect of snaring a girl who one of them will probably fuck a few times, if at all. And if they do manage to secure the girl for a longterm relationship, the pairing usually implodes down the track. The man either realizes he wasted his time or suffers greatly in material terms, such as by being draped divorce raped. In the meantime, the girls being fought over have their egos stroked time and time again. Unattractive girls see themselves as attractive and attractive girls with foul, entitled princess personalities find themselves validated once more. Everything in these situations is predicated on the men fighting and proving themselves, rather than the women reaching an appropriate standard of physical and emotional femininity. 3. Paying for them What are you getting from the transaction with her And yes, everything is transactional in malefemale relationships. Unless you are completely sure you have claimed the worlds best girl for yourself and even that belief is probably based on very false or temporary appearances, you should ideally be investing less financially in the relationship than she is. This may seem counterintuitive, especially when a man is sexually valued by women for his status, achievements, and resources. But we are not living in a time when almost every woman is marriageable. A man providing for a woman can only justify it if she is of highquality and gives him something back in return. On both these counts, most men are paying for dud deals. In every longterm relationship I have had, I have put less into the relationship financially, proportionallyspeaking. Almost always, even the girls gross investment has either approximated mine or surpassed it. For dates and during casual relationships, too, I pay for a womans time about as much as she pays for mine, if not less. When relationships end, girls can and do play petty games over money or property you may be owed. What matters, however, is how you conduct yourself overall. Only when a woman has materially invested in you or invests in you should you invest in her. When patriarchy returns, the malefemale dynamic will alter. Before that time, be sure she does her fair share financially. 4. Shifting or sacrificing their priorities for them Meanwhile, he should be do everything else for himself. Unlike many other selfdestructive behaviors concerning women, this one can be very incremental and hard to spot. It is very easy to procrastinate on your work, final exams, selfdevelopment goals, and the rest of your social life when what you feel is a highquality woman comes along. In fact, nature has basically designed you to do that by throwing your biochemistry into a druglike dependency at the beginning of a courtship. In addition to these problems early on, men are apt to continue the shelving of their other, more personal demands after the relationship is well established. On a topic I will explore in more detail in another article, there should be certain hours in many days or simply days in general in which women do not even enter your mind. Contrast this with your average man, who will throw away opportunities to further himself to please his girl. And often shes not his girl for much longer, as his neglect of himself becomes apparent in her less attracted mind. By devoting yourself to a ho, you become dispensable to a ho, not just psychologically, but physically, financially, and socially as well. Dont let yourself rot Your body, finances, education, and other forms of selfimprovement need to be your number one focus. After all, they are the only things you have or dont have 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Individual girls may come and go, but your obligations to yourself remain. Paradoxically, keeping these obligations to yourself are what attract girls in the first place. A man who takes proper care of his money, career, body, and social life gets women. 5. Moving to them, for them Sucker. This is the one even my leftwing father warned me about. But its something a lot of guys are yet to learn. Like shifting or sacrificing ones priorities, moving to a girl for a girl is conducive to throwing your own needs into utter disarray. Every time I moved to where a girl of mine lived, I did so mostly for myself. Whether to explore a new country for three months, or find a new, refreshing place to get my work done, the relocation benefited me. This is qualitatively far different from upending yourself to some new city for the mere chance to thrive and the desire to please a girl. Perhaps the saddest thing about the man who moves for his girl is that when he wants even a fraction of the favor he gave her, hes often left in the lurch. Dont make this mistake. Either she must move to you or you move to her for a lot of reasons that dont revolve around her. If the relationship fails and most of them do, you leave yourself in an equal or better position than the one you would otherwise be in. Dont follow the crowd of thirsty males Too many men slave away in a female desert. Girls are not nonexistent, but theyre too often lowquality relative to what a man is willing to do for them. Snap yourself out of these behaviors and help your friends shake them off, too. You may not indulge in them regularly, but the temptation to perform them at least sometimes is likely to be there. More broadly, we need to see a seismic shift in the way many men act. Become part of the solution. So whats just as bad as an entitled woman A man who encourages her entitlement with obsequious validation.",hate
"Alain Soral is an influential FrenchSwiss thinker, author, and filmmaker. His beliefs are summarized as French Third Position, basically a third party for those that reject the traditional left and right political views, and there have been Third Position movements in many European countries over the past several decades.Major beliefs of Sorals ideology include nationalism, political sovereignty, social conservatism, antiglobalism, antiimmigration, antifeminism, antibankster, and a noninterventionist antiwar foreign policy. A major slogan of Third Position is Reconciliation between the Labor Left and the Values Righteconomic policy which values individual work and labor, and social policy focused on nationalism and traditionalism.Early Life Alain Soral was born in 1958 in southeastern France. He attended a wellregarded private Catholic school, before enrolling in the distinguished National School of Fine Arts in Paris, founded in 1648, and later transferred to study under the philosopher and economist Cornelius Castoriadis, a famous 20th century thinker.Castoriadis Castoriadis favored autonomous societies that are selfaware of their autonomy and independence, and believed societies should provide legitimacy for their laws and government actions. Historically, this was often done through absolute monarchy by invoking religion and God, with the monarch having a direct connection to the almighty What God has commanded is what we must institute with the law.Modern capitalist societies proved their legitimacy through circular tautology that is they claimed that capitalism was logical and just, and therefore whatever a capitalistic society deemed profitable was therefore logical and just. A just autonomous society was always questioning and challenging its laws, but at the same time adhering to, respecting, and upholding the law.Castoriadis described modern society as a struggle between creative imaginary and capitalist imaginaryThe repetition of empty forms, of conformism, apathy, irresponsibility, and cynicism at the same time as it is that of the tightening grip of the capitalist imaginary of unlimited expansion of rational mastery, pseudorational pseudomastery, of an unlimited expansion of consumption for the sake of consumption, that is to say, for nothing, and of a technoscience that has become autonomized along its path and that is evidently involved in the domination of this capitalist imaginary. The other road should be opened it is not at all laid out. It can be opened only through a social and political awakening, a resurgence of the project of individual and collective autonomy, that is to say, of the will to freedom. This would require an awakening of the imagination and of the creative imaginaryPostUniversity Soral loved books and knowledge, studying radicals from throughout the political spectrum. He was a dragueur de rue street pickup artist when the PUA movement was virtually unknown. He developed a skill at attracting young, narcissistic, valueless city girls and claimed to bed hundreds of women, and published a book on game in 1996. His experiences with these women led him to develop strong antifeminist beliefs.He developed a strong dislike for the French BobosBourgeois bohemians, younger wealthy highly educated narcissistic hedonists interested in fashion and trends. Perhaps something like rich hipsters, but less retro, more fashionable and trendy.He joined the French Communist Party, motivated by his dislike of the bobos, and his camaraderie with the working man. The Communist Party, along with the Front National, were among the few opponents of the creation of the EU. Soral studied the works of Marx and other Marxists before leaving to join the far right Front National, where he was a speechwriter for Marie Le Pen. He noted that both Communists and Front National members were strongly nationalistic, and indeed many workers left the Communist Party to join FN around this time.He became a strong critic of feminism and minority politics gay, feminist, and Islamist or other racial multicultural groups. After Front National performed poorly in the 2007 elections, he formed Equality and Reconciliation , seeking to consolidate ideas on the left and right who believed in nationalism, patriarchy, anticommunism, antiimmigration, and antiZionism. ER is an alternative news site, with some tendencies to the American altright, pronationalist, and critical of modern culture and feminism. He describes it as Left for the workers and Right for morals.He is a boxer, and since 2004, has coached boxing. He records videos, has a regular feature naming the cunt of the month, and his works and website are very popular despite harsh attacks against him in the mainstream media.Summary Of Views Trolling a feministNot much is available in English of Soral, and even English subtitles on his many videos are hard to find. I have but a cursory understanding of French, so I have relied on secondary sources and translations. His major beliefs areAntiFeminism Views feminism as not prowork, as women have always worked, but instead as antifamily and antimother. Discusses two classes of feminists freaks and bitches. The real struggle is between rich and poor, not man and woman, who are naturally attracted to each other. He has attacked womens magazines as altering the social conscience and relegating women to the status of objects. Stresses selfimprovement and virility in men.Anticapitalism and anticonsumerism Opposed to valueless consumption and consumerism. In favor of banksterfree economics, and an end to the nanny state. Opposes desire society and the cult of celebrity.Antiimperialism Opposed to the Globalist Empire, and American Imperialism, attempting to spread its cultural, ideological, economic, social views everywhere and to destroy all nationstates.AntiZionism Has attacked Jewish lobbying and intervention in French affairs. Made statements criticizing the Jewish people for being ostracized in societies around the world, throughout history, which earned him an immediate and harsh media blackout. He makes a distinction between French Jews and Zionism, saying that Zionists are opposing the interests of France and French Jews.Anticommunitarianism Favors nationalism, not communitarianism. Calls communitarianism a poison. Opposed to ethnic, racial, sexual, Islamist or feminist communitarianism, which is opposed to morality and national standards. Opposes the public effeminate, homo and transsexual society, and laments the lack of strong male role models. Makes a strong distinction between homosexuality and the Gay Pride community movement, which promotes drag queens, parties, vulgar parades, and hypersexualization.Antivulgarity Opposes vulgar language, dress, and speech, especially in women. Has said he prefers publicly wearing the Muslim veil to thong underwear. Would go crazy at a Slutwalk. Critic of profanity and vulgarity proponent of morality and modesty.Islam Feels the menace of Islam is an artificially created and manipulated threat primitive Islamic society is not a real threat to modern western states, and capitalistic globalist interests manipulate the region to destroy the antiglobalist antifeminist culture of Islam, to foster animosity between social groups, to possibly create a clash of civilizations, or world war, leading to a full globalist takeover, and to loot Mideast nations, and that the fundamental values of moderate Islam are perfectly compatible with French moderate Catholic views.Antimodern culture and mainstream media Opposed to the decline in western values and culture, and the sorry state of mainstream media, who has labeled him a pariah.Le Neo masculinit Many likeminded red pill men are turned off by the leftright politics in America. The third position combines right views on nation, morality, and law, with some left positions on social issues and economics. I believe if both the left and right hate you, you are probably doing something right. The ideas here strongly resonate with neomasculinity. Sorals ideas are stimulating and interesting and definitely deserve further investigation.An excellent summary of Soral and his beliefs is available here .Read More What Is Neomasculinity ",hate
"Disclaimer This is not legal advice. If you are charged with a criminal offense or think that you may be, contact your attorney. If you are a Western man under 30, your world view when it comes to sex was forged in the era of internet pornography, epic divorce rates, hypersexualized television content and a political climate of anything goes sexual identity, at virtually any age. You could be forgiven for thinking that when you first had sex with your sweetheart back in high school or earlier, it wasnt something remarkable and youve both probably forgotten about it years later. You could also be one accusation away from defending yourself in a sex offense case.While American culture evolved or, as many fairly and convincingly argue, DE volved into a sexually open environment where there are few if any societal and legal restrictions beyond those involving children and animals, statutory rape is still caught in a complex patchwork of state based laws.Federal law does not stipulate a universal age of consent, instead leaving it to the states to codify. Though you are safe everywhere in North America by avoiding all girls under 18 and you may think thats the law of the land, federal statutes principally refer to matters surrounding pornographic material and prostitution. By the wayyou didnt take any naked selfies or make a homemade porno with her, right Good thing you didnt because you could have violated that federal law about pornography .What is the age of consent in America I wouldnt even trust her fake ID.The age for private consensual sexual acts in America ranges from 16 to 18 , sometimes lower in the case of married couples. Its even lower in some foreign countries. By the way, say youre an American student overseas with a foreign girlfriend whos legal in her country, but still under 18you might want to check with a knowledgable lawyer before getting down a d dirty.Why is this significant For starters, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child considers anyone under the age of 18 to be a child. That magic number is also used to prosecute anyone going overseas with the intent to have sex with a minor. While US law in this area is aimed at pedophiles and traffickers, theres no reason it could not be applied to a young man on a trip to Cancun or studying abroad in Eastern Europe. The most likely situation for a young American male will be domestic, however.Dont take one for the team.For example, back when you were 18 and your girlfriend was 15 and the age of consent in your state was 16, you might have both been well aware of what you were doing and done it several timesperhaps even with the knowledge and approval of your parents. You may have stayed with her for years and eventually got married, but more than likely you and she parted ways and havent looked back since.Till one day you get a knock at your door from a policeman who wants to question you about your relationship a few years earlier. Thinking nothing of it, you tell him the basic details, admitting to sexual contact, and bam, you are arrested for statutory rape of a minor. Any defense of her consenting multiple times, or even that you did not know she was underage, is irrelevantas a minor, she cannot consent and because of this she may have no say in whether or not to press charges.The long arm of the law may reach you. Well, thats no bother to me since it was so long ago and the statute of limitations passed anyway, right Not so fast. First, if you have amassed any assets years later, she could still decide to sue you in civil court for damages although this is not always successful  and either win at trial or eke out a monetary settlement from you. Even absent a criminal conviction or a civil court judgement against you, having to pay a settlement for a sex assault related case is something no man wants on his resume just ask Bill Clinton .Moreover, just because it is now beyond the statute of limitations for prosecuting you, do not assume you are in the clear. Statutes of limitations can be changed , once again including accused offenders even though they were previously beyond the statute of limitations. Any statements you may have made to law enforcement before this happens would once again be fair game.While the intent of changes to these laws is noblethey want to nail child abusers who got away for decadesthe reality is you can get scooped up into the mix if you as a teenager once had a sexual encounter of any kind with an underage girl, perhaps even if you yourself were underage. If you think you engaged in a situation where you could be charged, the best course of action is to clam up and consult lawyer in your jurisdiction.This applies even more if one day you are approached by anyone and out of the blue they bring up the subject even though youd nearly forgotten about it. If you get arrested and charged but the prosecuting attorney decides to not prosecute, continue to keep quiet regardless. Prosecutors come and go, and a replacement with a political agenda could perhaps decide to reopen your case and pursue charges.Branded for life. If you get charged but by some miracle are able to cop a plea and get probation with no jail time, you will probably still wind up in a sex offender registry , perhaps for life. Say you get luckier still and serious doubts surface about the veracity of the story and eventually the charges are reduced or dropped completely, resulting in no conviction and no sex offender registry requirement for you. Well guess what You will still have an arrest record for a sex offense on your rap sheetit matters not that there was no conviction.Imagine driving down the road years later, a cop drives up behind you and automatically scans your license plate as is now common practice. A sex offense arrest pops up. Think you stand a good chance of getting pulled over for further scrutiny What are the chances youre going away with a warning instead of a ticket that day For better or worse, cop instinct is to view arrests the same as they would a conviction, so its best to keep all arrests completely out of your life as much as possible.You will get no breaks, so watch yourself. And STFU. Yes, of course, you both knew what you were doing back on prom night. And yes, we know grown women teachers who have sex with minors often are convicted at trial and still receive no jail sentences . But you, sir, are a heterosexual man acting out on your urges and therefore a prime targetdoubly so if youre white, nonIslamic and attending college or boarding school, particularly a prestigious institution . Forewarned is forearmed.Young men need to be well aware of the laws in their state before engaging in any sexual contact in situations where they could face a statutory rape accusation. And if youve got a story or two from back in your glory days as the high school quarterback with the freshman cheerleader Dont tell that story to anyone. Ever. The political climate is not favorable to youand it could stay that way for a while absent a much needed reality check .Read More 7 Ways The Collapse May Unfold ",hate
"Home This Month Popular Feminism Has Lost The Minds Of Young Women Feminism Has Lost The Minds Of Young Women Maximus Decimus Meridius Maximus is a Man, capital M, period. Love. Truth. Justice. Liberty. Respect. These are the lodestones pointing true to magnetic masculinity in a polarized feminist west. His goal for writing on ROK is to be the gadfly that provokes thought and counters groupthink. October 29, 2016 The Sexes The idea that feminism is dead is gaining ground all across the west. One would like to think it is because of the trail blazing of the manosphere, and to a great degree it is. But truly, the root of feminisms death was in Man, capital M, from the very beginning. One look at Conan is all a man needs to know this truth. Feminism is dead. The movement is absolutely dead. The womens movement tried to suppress dissident voices for way too long. Theres no room for dissent. Its just like Mean Girls. If they had listened to me they could have gotten the ship steered in the right direction. My wing of feminismthe prosex wingwas silenced. I was practically lynched for endorsing The Rolling Stones. Susan Faludi is still saying Im not a feminist. Who made her pope Feminist ideology is like a new religion for a lot of neurotic women. You cant talk to them about anything.  Camille Paglia on Rob Ford, Rihanna and rape culture for MacLeans.ca Neurotic women indeed. Paul Joseph Watson of Infowars/Prison Planet fame was bang on in his assessment of feminism at the end of 2014. But he may have underestimated his conclusions in my opinion. Feminists did not just lose the debate, they lost the war. The feminist attempt to demonize normal male/female behaviour in public men initiating contact with a female with a hello and attempt to strike up a conversation backfired in less than a month. When you have a woman volunteer to walk down the street as Princess Leia, the QUEEN of 70s patriarchal sexist misogyny, to ridicule feminists, you have lost the war for hearts and minds. And when I say hearts and minds I mean the silent majority of young women who want NOTHING to do with feminism. Leia makes it clear in this video that boys will be boys. So too will jawas, Darth Vader and even Yoda apparently, that sly dude. Who knew And thats a good thing Men and women are meant to interact and engage in romantic courtship. Feminists may hate this, but the vast majority of women still prefer, and expect, the man to take the initiative to get the girl. This is how men and women were created and evolved, you cant fight Darwin and God and come out on top. This video shows that the majority of NORMAL women LOVE male attention. They WANT men to look at them. They WANT men to notice them. Why THEY WANT A MAN I realized this is the case when I decided to google the fast rising phenomenon of women against feminism . This image from the Women Against Feminism Tumblr page really hits home the loss for feminism. This woman was raped. She is not running around spreading lies like the UVA RAPE HOAX story that Rolling Stone ran and had to retract . She justs wants to go back to living a normal life. She does not want to be angry at ALL men for the crime of ONE of them. She does not want to demonize all men in some sad attempt to get revenge. She does not want to be a victim. Feminists have lost the female youth of Millenials, the very generation that is supposed to obliterate the patriarchy completely in the 21st century. I understand some men who are still angry over feminism may proclaim these women are doing nothing more than crying for sympathy and attention now that Millenial men have become vocal, blunt and merciless in their attacks against feminism and the current generation of women it has reared . The problem with this type of kneejerk reaction is just thatyoure being a jerk. Yes, far too many western women for comfort are no good for a relationship anymore. But, that does not also translate into there being no young women who are not just as frustrated and angry at feminism as you are and the feminists who claim to speak for them. Young women might not think about it as much since feminism has clearly made the road to independence an illusion easier for them to choose, but these women are taking note that men are completely ignoring them now that they have surpassed men in almost all aspects of western society. Case in point. I met a wonderful young Russian blonde a little while back. Twentythree. Tight. Feminine. So freaking perfect. We hit it off immediately on first contact. Having myself only traveled outside the west twice, I still primarily meet foreign women in my own country and every time I do, I am blown away by their immediate friendliness and ease in my company compared to western girls. As I conversed with this well educated and refined young Russian lady, she told me she was attending university and so naturally, I asked her what she noticed most about the boys on campus compared to back home. Her answer was revealing Boys They completely ignore the girls. Dont even look at them. Just walk on by. This really surprised her. Being a feminine Russian girl who expects men to look at women, this behaviour by western men was completely alien to her. Men, young boys, in their prime 20s, completely ignoring women on campus as they go about their day. According to Wikipedia, women against feminism started on Tumblr in 2013 . I see #WomenAgainstFeminism as a sign that many young women are fed up with feminism and male bashing in western society. It is not a sign of women speaking with two faces and trying to work both sides of the gender war to their advantage. All you have to do is look into the eyes of this young woman to know just how desperate these girls are for a real relationship, one with love and respect . I dont think men realize how significant a movement like women against feminism is. As men, we are naturally comfortable with open conflict and expressing not just dissenting, but offensive opinions. The very existence of women openly declaring they are rejecting feminism, and risking social ostracism in a wholly feminist dominated university climate, is why feminists are hyperventilating and going into apeshit, mentally insane overdrive mode to try and salvage what support they have left . Here are just a few mainstream articles trying to push the meme feminism is not dead and just needs a generational adjustment.",hate
"In a previous article , I discussed stretchingnamely, why stretching is important for the masculine man, and several stretches that you should use in your training to maximize your physical fitness. And while that advice is still valid, I neglected a very important concept in that first article the techniques that detail how to stretch.I am not referring to a specific stretch or some sort of hypothetical stretching mindset, but rather a set of techniques that can be utilized for any stretch to increase ones flexibility immediately. But before I can discuss those, I have to discuss the incorrect way of stretching that many people still use.How Not To Stretch Many people believe that stretching is a literal act of forcing the muscles and connective tissue to stretch avoid this at all costs  First and foremost, as I have discussed previously in these pages, you should never apply any stretching pressure to the connective tissue. They evolved solely to hold fast and keep things in one piece, they should never be stretched at allThe muscles are the anatomical feature that stretches, as they evolved to do. When stretching, your body should always be positioned in a way where the connective tissues are stable and the muscles are moving.Even when you are positioned properly, no part of stretching should involve the athlete forcing his muscles to stretch, as that risks muscular tearing which is a nagging injury that never truly goes away. This is because the human body has naturally evolved what is referred to as the  antistretch reflex  to prevent muscular tearingstretching the muscles increases in difficulty the farther and deeper the stretch is, and your body responds to this stress with pain. This is a biological sign telling you that if you go further youll be risking muscle tears, and should normally be a heeded warning.However, if you want to do advanced stretching such as that nighimpossible benchmark of fitness the splits, you will have to find a way to overcome this reflex without hurting yourself. And as luck would have it, there isRelax Into Stretching Reflexes can be overcome with gradual and repeated practicejust ask your friendly neighborhood hooker about how she overcame her gag reflex Similarly, your antistretch reflex that keeps your joints actually your muscles stiff and immobile can be overcome with a few techniques.The most basic of these techniques is the one that I have had the best results with as usual, the simple but difficult answer is usually the correct one, and that is the titular concept of relaxing into a stretchwith thanks to Pavel Tsatsouline for naming the concept.To use this technique, take an easy form of the stretch you want to do using the splits as an example, you would do a seated groin stretch. Engage the stretch just to the point where you feel tension in the target muscle, and thensit and wait.Yes, paradoxically, relaxation is the key to increasing your physical fitness in this context. You are literally going to sit there and wait for your muscles to stop fighting the stretchin other words, youre going to exhaust your reflex until it stops being reflexive.This is not something that happens quicklyfrom my experience, it will take 510 minutes per stretch, so it is perfectly acceptable for you to get a book or watch TV while doing this. As a side note, this is literally the only time where its acceptable to have a visual distraction during exercise, in my opinion.As you might expect, once your muscles have relaxed and the pain has melted away, you can increase the stretch a little bit more, and hold it for another 10 minutes. Repeat this process until your muscles are in pain and you judge that you cant go any furtherthis is a personal call that you will have to decide for yourself, as I cant judge when your muscles are demanding you to stop.This technique can be utilized for any stretch, and in many cases will give you the progress that you so desire. However, there are other methods in the Relax Into Stretch family of exercises that can be utilized as well, such as meditationmentally relaxing will lead to muscular relaxation.Or you can try forced relaxation, where you flex the muscle simultaneously while stretching, forcing the muscle to relax.Either way you slice it, dont just brute force your stretching, utilize these techniques for better results.Read More Why Stretching Is Essential For The Body With 6 Beginner Stretches To Get You Started ",hate
"  How Population Growth, Industrial Agriculture And Environmental Pollution May Have Weakened Society How Population Growth, Industrial Agriculture And Environmental Pollution May Have Weakened Society A determined young man with a strong sense of his destiny  to save his country from postmodern collapse. October 30, 2016 Culture The global population in 1800 was about one billion people. Today it stands at over seven times that amount, with the rapidly growing populations of India and Africa expected to increase that to at least nine billion over the coming years. Readers today are well used to the idea that the global south is densely populated relative to its economic size and area, but this was not always the case. Prior to the collapse of Empire, Europe, having undergone thorough industrialization, was the most densely populated continent in the world. Source The World at Six Billion, United Nations, 1999.19502100  UN, Dept. of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division 2011 Europe was also where the worlds social justice movementsliberalism, communism and feminismbegan, overthrowing the old order of kings, castes and courtship with the vulgar and degenerate world we suffer today. But why did this happen Why did the immense increase of wealth and prosperity not correspond to an increase of human happiness, but instead lead to the emasculation of men, the breakdown of the family, and the disappearance of religion and morality In these series of articles, I examine the root causes of this paradox, what one can do about it on an individual dietary level, and what one can do about it on an individual environmental level. I am a strong believer in social change through individual growth, and, having experienced a dramatic turnaround in the quality of my own personality and success of my outcomes as a result of following these strategies, I hope that others can benefit from my knowledge, and similarly make themselves into solid Men. Popular mainstream theories for social degeneration Many authors have postulated economic reasons for this degenerationindustrialization, having deprived men of their primary roles as the masters of nature, reduced their worth and attractivenessor utilityin the eyes of women. Relatedly, others argue that technological progress, which increased independence and ability for all, allowed women to go their own way. Another popular argument is that increased prosperity leads to reduced incentive for disciplinerselection versus Kselectionand so prosperous, disciplined societies create a generation of lazy youngsters, fat off the success of their parents, who cause so much havoc with their short sighted policies that their civilization collapses, leading to a new generation of disciplined youngsters who again create greatness. One example of a shortsighted policy would be the feminist political movement, which artificially separated woman from man by giving her, through affirmative action, socially harmful economic independence. While all these explanations bear some truth, none of them delve into the deeply emotional, spiritual, human and thus fundamentally biological causes of social degeneration. Why the mainstream theories are flawed To begin with, a healthy Man and a healthy woman, even with modern technology at their disposal, should not so substantially less love and cherish each other, as seems to be the case today. The proof of this can be seen by examining what it is women do with that technology a modern loose woman uses technology to go to places where men can ravish her. Even if it gives woman the ability to go it alone, Technology does not diminish her emotional and biological need for man. Further, the availability of technology does not always translate into its adoptionthe failure of Google Glass is the emblematic example. It does not have to be the case that smartphones are automatically adopted for Slut Culturethey do not have to automatically lead to female promiscuity. Anyone familiar with Russian or Japanese women, who have the same technology at hand, but a vastly greater sense of restraint and selfworth, can attest to this fact. Therefore, the technological argument is not sufficient to explain modern degeneracy, although it is certainly a necessary condition. credit Ninaras credit moguphotos To briefly examine the argument that Men no longer have nonfinancial utility in the eyes of women a man is not necessarily attractive to a woman if he actually breaks rocks, or actually kills other peopleinstead, being able to is sufficient. Therefore, the emotional and spiritual inseparability of a healthy woman from her evolved master, man, remains and will remain eternally true. The change in technology and the nature of mens work is not the causal factorinstead, the change in preferences of both men and women explains modern degeneracy. Men hardly today want to lead and possess their woman and women do not respond to weakling men. Let us examine the r/K selection argument if it were the case that wealth and ease begat indiscipline automatically, it would be true that the rich produce weak and undisciplined progeny. This may seem like a truism today, viewed through the lens of the postindustrial, overpopulated Paris Hilton West, but in societies of the past, it was certainly not the caserather, historically, the opposite has been true the weak were poor because they were undisciplined, and the strong were rich because they were disciplined. The poor raised weak and hence undisciplined children, while the rich raised strong and disciplined ones, so the cycle continued and over time aristocracies formed. An extreme version of this disciplinedrich mentality can be seen in modern British farmers, many of whom, financially wealthy and prosperous, drive old, beaten SUVs, reuse clothes and generally minimize expenditures. While it cannot be denied that even the modern rich have in general become mostly degenerate, this is, in my opinion, a disproportionately visible symptom of a deeper malaise that affects society across the board. Therefore, I do not rely on the technological or economic explanations for societal degenerationI view these theories as descriptive of passing symptoms or trends, and not timelessly causal truths.int The population growth, nutritional depletion and environmental pollution theory of societal degeneration Having outlined and accounted for the above theories, I argue instead that the degeneration of society is caused mostly by the biological degeneration of the human being that makes up the society. This degeneration is caused by factors that affect the human organism on the basest level, and the two primary factors are Nutritional depletion of food, caused by the growth of industrial agriculture, which itself is made necessary by unprecedented population growth. The pollution of the environment caused by industry and the introduction of unsafe technology. According to this view, it was not the Boomers access to ease that made them such degenerate and irresponsible scum, but rather the fact that the rapid population increase during their key developmental years meant that the growth of industrial agriculture that somewhat necessarily accompanied itthe Green revolutioncreated such nutritionally sparse food that there was insufficient development of Boomers brains, leading to a generation of overgrown children. Further, according to this theory, the increased dependence on technology is not viewed as the cause of millennial autism, but rather a symptom of millennial autism. Recent historical examples Consider the historical path of Communism, which did not generally spring up in the villages. This was not because the landlords were better able to control the peasants, but instead because poor city dwellers, even if earning a higher income than poor peasants, had access to much worse food and lived in a far dirtier environment, making them both mentally and physically ill. The unfortunate result of insufficient mental development in a crisis situation  our aim should be to save as many leftists as possible, and almost all can be. The poor in the countryside today continue to vote conservative or liberal, while the urban poor vote socialist, for this same reason the rural poor, despite usually being less wealthy than the urban poor, are intellectually mature enough to see how harmful a controlling government can be. The urban poor mostly achieve the intellectual maturity of children or adolescents, and mostly feel rather than think, so they support an emotionbased class war or gender war ideology. This theory explains the early rise of social justice in Europe, where industrial agriculture was first adopted on a wide scale, and also explains why such movements did not organically grow anywhere else until much later, owing to the much later adoption of industrial agriculture. It should be noted that in the countries where communist revolutions were actually successful, they enjoyed no broad support, but instead were able to defeat the mostly preindustrial historical governments because of these governments economic weakness, and also because of extensive support by globalist or communist interests this was true in Russia, China and Cambodia. Ancient historical examples This theory also explains the path of historical civilizationsRomes case is highly instructive. At its birth Rome was a small collection of largely selfsufficient, highly disciplined towns, where the diet, like in many towns of that era, was a mixture of grains, vegetables, small farmed meats like chickens, and hunted meatswhat we would call a balanced diet. In this society, men were the masters of their households, with power of life and death over their family members, while facing total responsibility for their family members behaviour. Only a group of strong, capable and selfdisciplined individuals could sustain such a social order. Population of the City of Rome 1.0E6  1 Million Inhabitants  Source www.davidgalbraith.org Romes extreme martial and social discipline led to expansion. As it expanded and the citys population grew, the diet for most people changed over time to mostly grains farmed highly intensively, shipped in from all over the Empire, losing a lot of its nutrition on the way. Simultaneously, and partly as a result of rising grain production, meat consumption fell, reducing the populations testosterone levels, leading to falling strength and willingness or ability to compete, as well as rising mental illness because of copper overload. The weakened populations increasing demands for emotion based socialism led to the growth of a massive welfare state, and eventual bankruptcy, hyperinflation and collapse of the central government. India is another equally tragic example. The population growth that resulted from highly prosperous Nanda rule led to the growth of Buddhism and the adoption of degenerate attitudes, moral collapse and eventually weakness to invasion. After the institutionalization of Buddhism by powerhungry and utterly Machiavellian psychopath Ashokawho looked to weaken the Brahmins, Hinduisms traditional moral guidesBuddhisms degenerate vegetarian curse spread like a virus, and created, over several generations, a population of weaklings, who werent again able to assert their independence for over a thousand years. The Song dynasty followed a similar path as these two empires, being eventually overrun by the Mongols the Yuan dynasty. Population of China  Source Vaclab Smil, Chinas Environmental Crisis 1993 This degradation of the diet, caused by population growth, has been, at least, a significant causal element behind the degeneracy and collapse of most prosperous sedentary civilizations. The modern context The dramatic increase of the population since ancient times should help you understand why humans today are such fools and weaklings compared to our ancestors. There is only so much nutrition in the worlds topsoil to go around, and a population seven times greater than 200 years ago, eating a diet uncorrected through nutritional supplementation for dietary sparsity, will be living individually, in effect, 1/7 th the life that its ancestor population did. Is it any wonder that people today feel so weak and helpless that they want mommy government and daddy police state to give them the illusion of comfort and security This theory is also borne out in the data in general, food today contains  to 1/10 th the nutrients it did in the 1930s, which was already about 50 years after the adoption of modern style industrial agriculture in the West. This dramatic fall in nutrition has accompanied the tripling of the global population, and closeto doubling of the European population, since that time. While some population control seems necessary, I believe that sustainable organic agriculture, combined with nutritional supplementation, should obviate a large amount of needed population reduction. I hope that the reader is, after consideration of these facts, sufficiently convinced of the true causes behind the modern worlds degeneracy. People have, fairly universally, across the political spectrum, become weak and insane from malnutrition. Artificial protein may have allowed some men to grow muscles, and calcium from an overreliance on milk may have allowed them to grow tall, but perhaps the lack of most necessary nutrients has meant that they are generally still retarded, emotionally, spiritually, and intellectually. The effects on modern society This weakness amongst menand dietary sparsity has disproportionately affected men, due to our much greater nutritional requirementshas not just resulted in an inability to control the destructive forces that lie latent in every society. Worse, the fundamental outlook of men, who viewed themselves as the creators of civilization, the slayers of enemies and the protectors of women, all under God, has changed. The modern millennial man is a childlike hedonist who cares little for his civilization, culture or People. An aspiring patriarch. An example of testicular failure. Image credit Giorgiomtb/Shutterstock Environmental toxins Environmental toxins are also a problem. Electrical, oestrogen and toxic metal pollution are underresearched but may have devastating effects on human health. Radio waves, plastics, unfiltered medication and purposely added toxins in the water supply, like fluoride and chlorine, have deleterious effects too. What can we do Considering these realities, it serves little purpose to blame women for their selfdestructive behavior. While in the past, like men, women used to have enough emotional maturity to try to live a life of selfrespect for example by remaining virgins and not drinking alcohol, they have never had much agency, charisma or true self will, even before the diet was empty, and before they were being stuffed full of drugs and chemicals by the unscrupulous pharmaceutical industry and its proxies. These poisons may cause serious and dangerous, although slowly fixable hormonal and behavioral changes, but the real effects are felt by their offspring. Unfortunately, once a woman is hooked on these drugs for example, the birth control pill or antidepressants, she is unlikely to come off them, and if she does, she is unlikely to do anything to fix the damage to herself or her future children. This is especially the case as the medical industry, which has brainwashed her to see doctors and the state as her loving protectors, is unlikely to recommend it. Even so, these drugs dont permanently alter the fact that women, as mostly emotion driven actors, are biologically and intrinsically people pleasers, and respond automatically to the most powerful person or group of people that can give them a raison dtre. Even if we cant ensure that women in general improve their diet and avoid pollutants, we can certainly make changes on an individual level, convincing or browbeating our girlfriends, sisters and mothers. The healthier a woman gets, the greater her affinity with nature becomes and the more maternal she feels, so you can be fairly certain that shell try and pass on the knowledge to her children and friends, like our grandmothers and greatgrandmothers did. Furthermore, there are a large minority of health conscious women, who it should be our duty to marry and impregnate as many times as possible. Considering the rapid population declines that will occur in the atheist and leftist segments of our countries native populations, these women are our best hope for creating a viable future. You will have to teach her a few things. Credit cspSubbotina The situation is not hopelessbut we have a fight on our hands In the past, wellinformed people couldnt expect, due to the limited, and elitecontrolled, nature of communication technology and the educational system, to make any impact on the vast majority of the population. The political fight against Big Agra and Big Pharma seemed hopeless. Today is different the growth of the Internet and the increasing spread of awareness has meant that more people are aware about the importance of eating well, avoiding environmental dangers and supplementing wisely. This is partly evidenced by the steadily rising percentage of people who eat organic diets, and the booming supplement industry. I hope that, in the future, at least a significant portion of us can survive in a sane enough state to politically fight back against moves by globalists, Islamists, communists and ruthless financiers who are circling, like vultures, over our degenerating civilizations. On the other side of this political battle, the globalist controlled medical industry has been the biggest proponent of unhealthy diets and dangerous and addictive drugs. Special interests have also been the biggest corrupters of regulators and the institutions created to defend the population against industrial and chemical pollution. A system of global monopoly wealth extraction is not possible with active, capable and selfconfident masculinities from proud nationstates to resist it those who seek to benefit from such a monopoly system have tried their absolute hardest to suppress natural health information. But so far they have failed, and the situation is only improving, so there is considerable reason for hope. Conclusion Our forefathers demanded to fulfill their destiny, ordained by the Gods, to defend our civilizations against the forces of rapacious greed and murderous atheistic villainyto be the protectors and kings of our people. Today, most men are mentally ill and have become childish hedonistic narcissists. As expected, the ruthless and soulless have exploited this weakness for their own benefit. Now that you have, I hope, understood the principles behind why most of us have lost the urge to fight to protect our cultures, the cause and fix to the industrial malaise should no longer seem out of reach or impossible to grasp. This area of the human condition is just one another where we stand at the crossroads of history. But in my opinion it is the most important if the dietary trend of the last two centuries is not reversed, and the nutritional quality of at least a significant minority of men is not substantially improved, then each generation of people will become more communist, more feminist and more weak than the last, and the globalist special interests that seek to create a totalitarian worldmonopoly police state will win, regardless of temporary political victories. Each of us has chosen a path to follow in our quest for spiritual, intellectual and national salvation. This is mine. In my future articles I will detail the best dietary approach for strong men and beautiful women to follow, and overview the most important environmental precautions we must take, in our quest to fix the root causes of modern degeneracy. I hope that, ultimately, you are convinced to help me, and others like me, prevent our world from collapsing entirely into a miserable cyberpunk dystopia. Oct 30, 2016 Kshatriya Indransha",hate
"Home This Month Popular Airbnb Goes Full SJW And Demands Users Host Deviants Of Every Kind In Their Home Airbnb Goes Full SJW And Demands Users Host Deviants Of Every Kind In Their Home David G. Brown David is a lifelong dissident and intellectual rebel. He despises political correctness, which replaces real, needy victims with narcissistic leftists out for a free meal. Though still a young man, he has watched society descend into its present morass with great sadness, combined with a determination to help make things better. He tweets when theres something worth tweeting here . October 30, 2016 News You commit to treat everyoneregardless of race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation or agewith respect, and without judgment or bias.  Airbnbs new SJW diktat Shortterm residential accommodation network Airbnb is forcing its providers to adhere to a new nondiscrimination policy , including a requirement to accept transgender people. The policy takes effect on November 1 and is accompanied by a slew of other recent or impending changes, which Airbnb says are designed to make its community more inclusive. Those who refuse to accept the main nondiscrimination policy will barred from listing their properties with Airbnb. The major problem with Airbnbs new nondiscrimination provisions is that they really just represent an euphemismbowing to a customers feelings, rather than proven discrimination. The overall framework of the companys policy alterations assumes that those accommodation providers accused of discrimination are actually guilty of it. This rush to judgment gives little or no recourse to those who depend on Airbnb to generate an income. It also makes it very easy for certain protected groups, most notably transgender people, to falsely or very loosely claim discrimination, when, in fact, the issue is likely to be the prospective guests temperament or perceived reliability in respecting the property. Secondly, the policy changes ignore the unique nature of sharing economy sites like Airbnb. Accommodation providers are often accepting guests into their literal homes, or their sole investment property. Whereas hotels have roundtheclock staff, including security, Airbnb properties are much more informal and unsupervised. Providers therefore have good reasons to be very judicious about who exactly they let into their residences. Airbnbs Open Doors policy treats any discrimination complaint as gospel truth Brian Chesky mustve drank the same poisoned water as fellow tech SJW Jack Dorsey of Twitter. Well be implementing a new policy called Open Doors. Starting October 1st, if a Guest anywhere in the world feels like they have been discriminated against in violation of our policy  in trying to book a listing, having a booking canceled, or in any other interaction with a host  we will find that Guest a similar place to stay if one is available on Airbnb, or if not, we will find them an alternative accommodation elsewhere.  Brian Chesky, Airbnb CEO and cofounder In addition to dictating what kinds of guests can enter their providers properties, another one of Airbnbs new policies, which is already in force, treats those accused of discrimination as immediately guilty. Rather than determining whether discrimination has occurred, Airbnb has made it clear that it will bend over backwards to find those claiming discrimination other accommodation within its network or, more strangely still, alternative accommodation outside its network. The second arm of this discrimination response will become very interesting indeed should privatelyowned Airbnb decide to go public. It is hard to see how shareholders would acquiesce to a company offering customers thirdparty accommodation options that effectively deprive it of money. Airbnb is simply trying to have its cake and eat it, too. On the one hand, it wants to create as wide a market for itself as possible, now having providers offering 2,000,000 listings in 34,000 cities around the world. On the other hand, however, it wants to assume total control for determining what is and what is not discrimination, despite having no ability to verify pretty much any of the accusations. Airbnb are mere gatekeepers, providing a rudimentary service that makes its bucks by the sheer volume of providers. These same providers should not suffer because of the companys thinlyspread business model. Allegations of discrimination have been scant at best We dont question the right of people to be selective about new housemates, so why not Airbnb providers and their guests Various news articles reporting on the shift in Airbnb policies have only been able to point to isolated instances of even alleged , let alone proven discrimination. The best that SJW enablers can offer is a deeply flawed Harvard study, which claimed that prospective guests with stereotypical AfricanAmerican names like LaToya and Darnell were 16 percent less likely to be approved by the companys accommodation providers. Considering that a guests profile provides a lot more information than just their name, the Harvard research leaves a lot to be desired. Moreover, names like Cletus and MarySue would arguably garner even less approvals. Both these white names and the aforementioned AfricanAmerican names usually dovetail with some of Americas least sophisticated and worldly types, the exact kinds of people least likely to be allowed into someones home. It has precious little to do with race and almost everything to do with runofthemill decisions about how to safeguard ones own property by entrusting it to the right people. Such decisions are routinely accepted when new housemates are sought, so why not with Airbnb Has Airbnb signed its own execution order . @bookingcom is better than @Airbnb  cheaper prices, always instant booking, tons of apartment listings, better interface, and no SJW crap.  Roosh @rooshv October 29, 2016 Just as Roosh swears by Booking.com, there are plenty of other options you can take in avoiding Airbnb from now on. Like Twitter, the company is quickly falling under the spell of the SJW crowd. It seems certain that, minus a backtrack, Airbnb and its reputation will follow Jack Dorseys company into the abyss. Unlike Twitter, though, Airbnb may never make the jump to publiclylisted company. We live in very sad times for freedom. But theres one freedom we can all exercise nowstaying the hell away from Airbnb and its SJW madness.",hate
"It wasnt long ago that the Left represented the antiestablishment wing in politics. They used to fight against globalism remember the antiglobalization movement even if their motives were different from those of todays antiglobalists, as well as being against censorship, imperialist wars, and the expanding powers of governments and corporations. But today, you see leftists protesting against Brexit, attacking and censoring anyone who disagrees with the establishment using Twitter on their Apple products while sipping on their Starbucks coffee, and are calling for war in Syria to challenge the Russians. So, just how the hell did did they end up becoming the patsies for the elitesTo understand, we must go back to 2011 when the Occupy movement was ongoing. The Occupy protests, which now seem like ages ago, came about as a response to the economic downturn with the people realizing that they were being screwed by the system. We can debate endlessly about exactly who these people were and the motives behind them, but the important fact is that, to the elites, it was a sign that the people were waking up and challenging their power.The elites were in a panic as this was the first time in postwar history that the people of West mobilized in mass to threaten their rule. So, the cabals decided that they needed to act fast before the whole movement evolved to a fullblown revolution. And they already had a plan in mind the never antiquated strategy of divide and rule.The Diversion When the people are discontent and angry from being powerless and dispossessed, the pressure will mount and it wont go anywhere. The people want to vent out their frustrations. The elites know that responding directly with repression only inspires greater desire to rise up, so instead of fighting it, they prefer to rechannel that pent up energy elsewhere.On February 2012, with the Occupy movement still raging, the elites were given that golden opportunityor, rather, they created onewhen a black teenager was shot dead in Florida the none other than the infamous Trayvon Martin case. The shooter wasnt even a full white, but the elites jumped at the chance and used their control of the media to throw everything they had on it anything to divert the public attention away from them. With their efforts, it quickly became the biggest story of America.But they didnt stop there. Police shootings, which have always been happening and to all races, were also highly publicized by the mainstream media to stoke liberal outrage and racial tensions that led to the creation of Black Lives Matter movementa movement that is financed by George Soros and others to stir up unrests across America.Did the elites convert Occupy protesters into SJW patsiesThe diversion was complete as the people were now more interested in racial issues than the 1 who were dictating their lives. The Occupy movement faded away and the people were now venting out their anger elsewhere. Although I dont have as much proof as with the rise of BLM movement, I strongly suspect that the resurgence of social justice warriors around the same time is also the work of the elites who want the Leftists to target fellow citizens over asinine cultural issues rather than the established order.The Strategy Back in 19th century, Karl Marx claimed that religion and nationalism was being used to distract the masses from the fact that they were being oppressed under capitalism. If we were to apply this concept to the world today, the culture wars going on now are distractions to keep the masses from undermining the power of the elites.The goal the elites is simple divide the masses and let them fight each other so that they will never come together to topple those in power. Meanwhile, they themselves focus on expanding their own wealth and continue to implement institutional control to further their globalist plans. The worst case scenario the elites want to avoid is to have the common people unite as one, so they must do everything they can to fragment them by creating as many divisions as possible.My understanding of their modus operandi is this 1 Use hotbutton issues to stir up controversy something that doesnt affect them like gay marriage, race issues, and all other politically correct nonsense. 2 Have the Leftists either get outraged or do something that will provoke a reaction from the Right. 3 Let the people vent out their anger onto each other and get at each others throats. 4 When the issue fades away, foment a new controversy to repeat the whole process. By cycling through them over and over again, the elites are able to maintain the status quo and keep the people from uniting against them.Thus, we have our current situation where the masses are divided with blacks against whites, women against men, Islam and atheism against Christianity, Left against Right, and so on, but no more antiglobalization, Tea Party movement, or Occupy Wall Street.As long as those on the left continue berating the right as racists, sexists, and bigots who are controlled by corporations and the right in turn accuse the left of being degenerate, socialist slackers who just want freebies from a nanny government, nothing will change. As long as the two sides see each others as enemies who are stupid and ignorant, and getting in the way of creating a decent society, the people will remain divided. As long as the rest of the population go berserk over wedding cakes for homosexuals, the latest misogynist outrage, or how a lion named Cecil got shot, the elites will continue to win.A Couple More Points To Consider I know they look like an occupying army, but theres nothing to be alarmed about. Theyre just your friendly neighborhood police doing their jobs to protect you from the terrorists.First, while this article has been focused on how the Left has been toyed by the globalist elites, lets not forget that the Right are not totally immune to their influence either. Remember how Neocons  globalists puppets disguised as conservatives  effectively lured the conservatives in America through faith and patriotism The support they got from that base was the impetus to launch their war against Iraq based on bullshit evidences of WMDs and SaddamAlQueda link. While the Right has changed a lot since then, there are still conservatives today who are itching for a war with Russia because USA USA USA .Second, it is crucial to remember that although the main goal is to maintain divide and rule, it is not the end of it. The elites have far more sinister aims. By raising hell in societies through demographic conflicts and terrorism, the elites are preparing for a total social control. I get the feeling that the elites are letting the chaos and violence run its course so that the people from the two opposing camps will join together in their approval of new government measures for social control.No matter their differences, when the people get terrified of savagery and disorder, theyll welcome the state to intervene in the name of security. Europe is already getting used to large military presence on their streets while the US government is seemingly preparing for a war against their own citizens . A leaked Soros memo also reveals that the BLM movement is potentially being used to federalize the US police . While many people seem to be concerned about violence and terrorism, it seems those are just tools used by the elites to justify a totalitarian state in the near future.The Culture Wars Necessary Fight Or Engineered Distraction The issue of culture wars is not an easy one as they are important in many ways, but are still forms of distraction implemented by the elites.On one hand, we are playing into the hands of elites by raging against social justice and feminist pigshits instead of trying to stop the globalists, Zionists , bankers, megacorporations , and the governments from undermining our existence. Really, do the issues of politicallyincorrect Halloween costumes and whatever bathroom trannies use matter more than the fact that the middleclass is being destroyed, revelations of massive corruption in the DNC, the coming policestate, and the globalist wars that are causing death and destruction around the world All the drama of outrage and counteroutrage is silly when the elites are snickering as their new world order is taking shape.On the other hand, culture does matter in many ways. Uncontrolled immigration, antimale laws, and censorship are all very relevant issues. And as much of the Leftists are now serving as pawns of the establishment, the situation isnt exactly the divide and rule model I described above. In a way, we are now forced to fight the Left and everyone else who are getting in the way of fighting the globalist elites.So, does this mean we should ally with those who scorn us Or should we continue playing the elites games and bicker with their SJW drones I dont have a good answer, but whatever we choose to do, I believe it is crucial for us to focus our battles and not get trolled into petty issues that the mainstream media wants us to focus on. We should always keep in mind that it is always those at the top who are the true enemies of mankind.Conclusion Is There Still Hope Although we no longer see grassroots movements and popular mobilization, the current US election has shown that the people are still awake and sick of the establishment. To me, that alone is a hopeful sign that people are still willing to challenge the ruling class.With Bernie Sanders brought down by the establishment and his supporters scattered into different camps, the only antiestablishment movement now is the presidential campaign led by Donald Trump. This is why we are seeing unprecedented efforts by the elites to bring down Trump and use disgruntled Leftists against his supporters.I have my doubts about Trump , but he is thousand times preferable to the certain nightmare that Hillary Clinton will bring to America and the world if she gets elected. But besides voting, I believe that it is more important for the people themselves to wake up and be aware of the methods of control that are being implemented upon us. We cant constantly expect some knight in shinning armor to come rally us we must take the initiative ourselves and be willing to fight for our own destiny.Read More The Elites Have One Rule For Themselves, And One Rule For The Rest Of Us ",hate
"When people ask me about my current position fighting in the culture war, years after starting my writing career with Bang books, I simply say, I just wanted to get laid. From these hedonistic beginnings opened a path that I find myself in today. A reviewer of my new book Free Speech Isnt Free also noticed this transformationIve been following the Red Pill community for a a few years now. The members therein have been engaging in some of the most relevant conversations anywhere on the net. Roosh is one Ive only recently become familiar with as I tend to appreciate and relate more to the more traditionalist members like Vox Day, Dalrock, and Roissy.What is so fascinating about guys like Roosh is how their journey to acquire more sex and attention from highly attractive women has led them stumbling across uncomfortable truths about the world that we men of the West find ourselves living in.This book is a very straightforward account of an encounter that an iconic Red Pill pillar had with the traditional media community that exposes a truly shocking level of laziness and corruption on the part of an institution that we are supposed to respect for some reason. I remember watching from a social media distance as these events went down and I had no idea just how bad it was.I really admire the stones on this kid and I hope he stays motivated and encourages more people to be bold with the truth which is always unPC. Im not a fan of lotharios but I appreciate intellectual honesty and bravery. I hope Rooshs Neomasculinity gets legs. I really do.How did game serve as the gateway drug Simple I kept asking why, as if I was an annoying 8yearold child.Why are woman attracted to me when I dance and act like an entertaining clown  Why did my father not have to act like a clown to attract my mom Why has society changed to encourage women to pursue exciting bad boys and clowns over good men Why are institutions like the media and universities pushing women into behaviors which harm them and the family unit Why is there a concealed group of elites who seem to control politicians and the most important institutions Why are those institutions attacking me for speaking the truth There wasnt only one step from having fun into the nightclub to fighting back against social justice warriors and the media, but several steps that had to take place over the past 15 years. My path weaved through sex and gender relations, but there are other paths as well, which I describe in The 5 Paths To Realizing Truth . For example, minimalism is another point of entryWhen you live below your means, you begin to see that most people are unnecessarily living above theirs. That leads to the conclusion that they were trained to live a life of excess by corporations with the complicit help of a government that wants to keep society in a neverending state of indebtedness and distraction so they ignore everyday injustices while losing any will or desire to fight the establishment. The easiest stepping stone out of The Truman Show is to realize that consumer lifestyles are not the path to happiness, and those those who chase material possessions are misguided.Many other men have also had a similar path as myself, whereby promiscuous sex was a device for understanding the world and deciding on behaviors that are more sustainable to the male soul. While not every man gains wisdom during the stage of his life where he wants to sow his royal oats, many do, and they use that wisdom to devise solutions that can solve our modern problems. I do not at all regret engaging in shallow sex with many dozens of women throughout the world, because it has developed my thinking into what you read now, even though the sex itself wasnt especially memorable and didnt give me much except momentary pleasure.From my current vantage point, it really does feel like it was all predetermined, as if I was supposed to participate in shallow intimacy in order to arrive at true understanding, but that would imply some sort of divine providence. Whatever the mechanism, its clear to me that many of the behaviors and ideas we hold now could be mere waystations for a grander, more universal truth. Whatever individual journey youre a part of, I hope well find out soon enough.To see the whole story of how the media attacked me with an incredible attack of 1,600 media articles , along with my analysis of the establishments master plan, check out my new book Free Speech Isnt Free . It has a balanced mix of narrative and ideology that will also give you actionable advice to help defend yourself against establishment attacks.

"A subject not often discussed is the topic of how to repair strained or broken relationships. It is one that comes up in everyones life, so it will be useful to make a few suggestions about it here. We will talk about relationships from friends, family, and lovers.Relationships among friends we will treat first. The first step in this process is to make an evaluation to determine whether the relationship is worth saving or rehabilitating. It is a simple fact of life that some relationships have an expiration date when two people no longer have anything in common, or their paths take them in divergent directions, it may be difficult to find common ground. In this situation, it is always better to let the relationship die a natural death slowly, rather than rapidly. Abrupt terminations may leave the other party with negative feelings, and this should be avoided if at all possible.There are some instances where repair is not possible. When someone has committed a fundamental violation of trust or respect, this is a warning sign that the person was never a friend in the first place. Another point to keep in mind is that repair of a broken relationship requiresno, demandsthe participation of both parties. If the other person is unwilling to participate in the process, then your efforts will be futile, and will come to nothing.Once we have determined that the friendship is worth repairing or sustaining, the next step is to decide how to make the first approach to the other party. In this we must try to evaluate the reasons for the problems in the first place. We should make an honest assessment about how things got to where they are. Did someone say or do something that caused hard feelings on the other side Was there some intervening cause that made the two parties diverge in plans and activities These types of questions must be honestly and repeatedly asked. We have a tendency to minimize our own hurtful actions and exaggerate those of others, and this must be kept in mind.The key rule at this point is to try to put ourselves in the shoes of the other party. We must try to see things from our friends perspective. For many people this can be difficult, as it involves getting past our own feelings of hurt or rejection and into the shoes of the other person. And yet it is essential. Very frequently the reasons for strained or broken friendships lies in the fact that there is some problem going on in the other persons life. Only by being a perceptive student of human nature can we divine the cause. Sometimes the only thing that caused the strained relationship was some misunderstanding that was easily curable.Keep in mind that we must tryat least in our own mindsto discover the source of the other persons problem. This is not always possible, as human beings are not always rational. But we can at least make the effort. I remember in the film Hoffa that there was a great line from Jack Nicholson. He told one of his men, Real problems, real grievances can be resolved. They can be negotiated. But imaginary grievances That man is going to hate you for life. I have no idea if Jimmy Hoffa every actually said this, but it sounds like something he would have said. He meant that we should avoid hurting the pride of our friends. We should be acutely aware how it is sometimes the intangible slights that can most rankle with a man.When you have decided to make the first step, it is always better to initiate contact directly. Do not wait for the other person to do it. Depending on the circumstances, this should be done discreetly and without too much in the way of overpowering insistence. There is a certain type of finesse that a man should have at critical times, and this is one of them. The approach should be direct, but neither insistent nor demanding. A fish is best hooked with a lure gently laid.Of vital importance here is that the approach be sincere. One should genuinely want to contact the other party. Sincerity is the glue that binds friendships together and permits their longevity. There should be no hypocrisy or falsity in any of our dealings with friends. This kind of thing is immediately apparent and, once detected, its whiff surrounds the offending party like a permanent cloud. If the other party is receptive to the approach, we can then gradually feel our way forward, taking care to avoid the reasons why the friendship became strained in the first place. Things may never quite go back to what they were, but at least we can find solid ground for a new frame of reference.Two examples will suffice here. The historian William Shirer worked closely with famed correspondent Edward R. Murrow when the two were in Germany in the 1930s. Yet after the war was over, the two grew apart. Shirers account of the estrangement suggests that he was repelled by Murrows enthusiastic adoption of the anticommunist hysteria of the time. Shirer found himself gradually blackballed from most major news networks before being forced out completely. He broke with Murrow over these events. Many decades later, he approached Murrow all venom spent, the two were able to find common ground again.Another example makes the same point. Theodore Roosevelt was a strongwilled, insistent man, to say the least. He was in a position to choose his successor as president, and to this end he selected a man very different from him, the affable and rotund William Howard Taft. Taft eventually began to find Roosevelt an overbearing and unwelcome presence in his life. The two men eventually broke completely, a result of their personality differences and different conceptions of leadership. To his credit, Roosevelt eventually approached his old friend privately to patch things up. They were never the same, of course, but at least some cordiality was restored.Relationships with family are of a fundamentally different sort. Because we are linked by bonds of blood or perhaps marriage, it will be more difficult to disentangle ourselves from those with whom we have become estranged. On the other hand, it may be easier to repair such grievances, or at least find common ground, since there may be more shared experiences with the other party that act in our favor. The key here is not to expect too much. Although shared history and common blood may work in our favor, they can be counterbalanced to some extent by the fact that irrational family antagonisms can run deeper than those from strained friendships. Patience and persistence are most important here, perhaps more so than friendships with those unrelated to us.Repairing strained relationships with lovers is perhaps the most difficult. When a man and woman have been united in the past through the coital act, an entirely different set of emotions and motivations come into play. Relationships between lovers can fail or become strained for an infinite number of reasons, and it would be impossible to discuss all of them here. It is enough for me to state my opinion that it is nearly impossible to bring an intimate sexual relationship back to what it was after it has been broken.Strained is one thing broken is quite another. My own experience leads me to believe that once a sexual relationship is done, it is done. One cannot really go back to what it was before. Amicable dealings are certainly possible, and happen all the time but I would not call this friendship. I would call it an uneasy equilibrium. Loves inflammatory presence scorches all it leaves in its wake.Read More  5 Proven Ways To Stop Obsessive Thoughts ",hate

"October has been a portentous month for the presidential campaign. In the beginning of the month women came forward accusing Trump of unwelcome advances. Later, FBI Director James Comey reopened the criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton after finding more government emails on pervert Anthony Weiners computer. But the most important event may be a meme campaign that highlights Hillarys support forcing women to register for the selective service.The meme campaign consisted of dozens of fake ads posted under the #DraftOurDaughters hashtag that highlight two very important policy points of the Hillary campaign First, Hillary is a radical feminist. Thus she favors equality in all thingsthat includes equality in combat. As a step in that direction, Hillary told the Huffington Post that she will support legislation to register for the draft.Young women may think registering for the draft is not a big deal. They should reconsider because of the second policy of the Clinton campaign She will almost certainly start a war against Russiaa war that will see those young women drafted into combat on the front lines.Hillary has repeatedly blamed Russia for Wikileaks and she stated that she would get revenge through military actionAs president I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack. We will be ready with serious political, economic and military responses .The #DraftOurDaughters campaign could be the thing that brings down the Hillary campaign. To get elected, Hillary relies on two demographics People of Color and liberal white women. Up until now, women have been able to support leftist social policy because it did not impact them negatively. If they become aware that Hillary intends to draft them into combat to fight a war with Russia, they may rethink the wisdom of their equalist position.Here are some of the best examples of the #DraftOurDaughters campaign.I feel this one is the most powerful. It clearly states Hillarys intention to put women into combat and start a war with Russia. Unlike the Arab nations that the US has been toppling for the neocons, Russia has a formidable military and nuclear weapons. Any military conflict will not be short and easy. That means it will highly likely that young women will soon find themselves getting blown to smithereens if they elect Hillary.The above three ads all target the weak, cowardly men who either support Hillary or the Never Trump cuckservatives. In the Alt Right, these men are frequently portrayed as being cuckolded by wives. Hence, they are often mocked for their wives having children who are not their own My wifes son or My wifes daughter.The ad below drives this point home even more forcefully. While women might encourage their men to vote Hillary or oppose Trump for being too alpha, they secretly despise the weakness of these men.The following ads are directed to convincing women of the ramifications of their decision to vote feminist. Feminism taken to its logical conclusion means you are going to have to trade your Louboutins for combat boots. Lots of the ads emphasize Hillarys extremely aggressive stance toward Putin and Russia. She has blamed WikiLeaks on Russian hacking even though there is no proof that the Russians were to blame. And she and the Obama administration have been saber rattling against Russia in Syria.The really frightening thing is that mainstream pundits are now starting to parrot the idea that the US must go to war with Russia. All the more reason to elect someone who is not controlled by wealthy donors like Hillary.The ad below indicates that our enemy Putin has a saner view on women in combat than the Democrats do.While the campaign is mostly geared to point out Hillarys intention to draft women, it also reminds men that their lives will not be spared in the conflagration that Hillary will start.The media often portrays war as a sanitized affair. A soldier, safely positioned in a USlocated command center, controls a drone that takes out the bad guys. The reality of war is that people from both warring factions die and are maimed. Once Hillary gets in, it wont be just men dying in large numbers. Women will experience equality in having their lives snuffed out.A final ad drives home the point that the future war with Russia and Iran and Syria will not be any sort of conflict against barbarism or evil. It will be for Hillarys power trip. Conclusion Elections matter. For decades, women have voted for leftist policies that have put the burden on other people. If they are successful in electing Hillary, they will face the bitter consequences of their decisions. But unfortunately, they will not be the only people impacted. Thousands of innocent Americans, Russians, Syrians, and Iranians will also have to pay the price of their virtue signaling.The #DraftOurDaughters campaign may be enough to wake some of them up from their folly.Read More Hillarys Alt Right Speech Bombed ",hate
"The greatest trick that feminism has pulled is to convince the masses that women are presently disadvantaged relative to men.It is true that at first glance, men dominate every field, from business to Pokmon Go achievements , which can lead some to think that there is a conspiracy against women. But the male superiority in many fields is exactly what allows society to prosper. Years after the humiliating debunking of the wage gap, its time to address the real elephant in the room the fact that women dont pay taxes.A research report on the fiscal contribution of men and women across age groups was published by the Victoria University of Wellington . Lets explore the key findings.This is the wellknown earnings gap incorrectly referred to as the wage gap. Womens preference for low paying jobs, among others, is a factor at play here. Another factor is the amount of women working part time. The average week for women, in this research, was 28.9 hours, and 37.2 for men. The workforce participation rate did not differ between men and women in significant ways.This is the disposable income. This is the income remaining after deduction of taxes and other mandatory charges, available to be spent or saved as one wishes. You can see that progressive taxes unfairly impact males , and reduces males disposable income near womens, although the market income was almost double that of womens. If it disproportionately affects men , you can be assured that no one will complain.Those are the raw taxes paid by men and women. The tax gap has, oddly, never been an gender issue until now.When the tax money received by men and women is included in the equation, you can see that for most of womens lives except between 44 to 60, they receive more tax money than they supply the state with. Men, on the other hand, give the state more tax money than they receive from 23 to 65 years.This is where it gets upsetting. As you can see, womens short period of positive fiscal impact doesnt come close to counterbalance an already massive overall negative impact. The net fiscal incidence on men is approximately zero when accumulated over all ages. As such, society invests in young males, and they subsequently pay back societys investment. Women bear massive costs to society, while we were taught to see them as underprivileged.By the end of her life, the average woman will cost about 150,000 to the average taxpayer. This means that an average man is extorted 150,000 in his lifetime that will be directly transferred to women. If men could use that money to their will, women would chase men as much as men chase women nowadays.There are a few confounds that need to be ruled out. The authors mention specifically that health and education costs are almost equal for men and women. Also, the workforce percentage doesnt exceed 10 difference between men and women. Women dont spend more for children either, according to the report. Even if there were confounds that needed to be accounted for, this is not something feminists have done for the 77cent wage gap. They have compared raw percentages without accounting for any confounding factors.Also, these numbers do not include massive costs for the governmental budget for womens issues, that is a massive burden for the state. For instance, my local government from a Canadian province of 8 million people just announced a 200,000,000 plan to fight sexual violence against women , after two immigrants dingdongditched women in a student house .Add to that millions invested in sexed programs, in which a feminist teaches boys that porn movies tailored for them shouldnt be imitated, and that instead, that they should have their partners pleasure in mind, while teaching the exact opposite to girls. The government takes money from males to empower women into hating men and their contribution to society.https//t.co/Rnb9rpFW3s Qubec Canada announces 200 million plan against sexual violence after two FOREIGNERS touched female students Nicolas Kilsdonk @nkgervais October 29, 2016 The data also doesnt include all the money directly and personally transferred from a man to a woman. For instance, while women make so little, they still account for 85 of all consumer purchases . And you were wondering why marketers so desperately try to appeal to women in advertisements.A metaphor for male taxpayers and women This is a real Danone ad. Watch it here or see my comment here .The only defense that feminists can use, when confronted with these facts, is that women invest so much time in children. However, feminists made it very clear in the past decades that a womans contribution to society shouldnt be based on her involvement with children. Moreover, at birth rates of half the necessary 2.1 birthrate for population stability, theyre also doing the children thing pretty badly.These findings raise a serious question would feminism survive a libertarian regime that doesnt involve male tax money After all, it is not a coincidence that women consistently vote for a welfare state. Within 10 years of womens suffrage in the USA, the government doubled their tax expenditure and revenue . Womens voting patterns have made the government become the new providing husband. But this time, the providing husband doesnt get a woman or children in return. Remove taxes, and no woman will ever claim to be a strong, independent woman. The state is cucking you. A little like if prostitution was not only legal, but free . Most guys would probably be strong, independent single males.Pretty ironic that the institution that gives money to women for being pregnant, prevents them from being paid less, makes abortions affordable is entirely supported by men. Feminists are not seriously against living in a society entirely supported by men, they are just against men having the autonomy over the wealth they create. Male wealth is a public good and female wealth is her body her choice.Its time we fight for equal tax.Here are my social media accounts Twitter , Facebook , YouTube Read More Yet Another MediaHyped Rape Accusation Is Debunked ",hate
"The above photo was snapped in Ferguson as thugs burned the city down. Could we see a repeat of that fateful event and perhaps a worsening of it soon to a city near youThe election is the focus of every news channel ad nauseum. But few people are focused on the day after the election. No matter who wins this years presidential selection the possibility of civil unrest the day after election day and beyond is a real possibility. Are you ready for chaos if it developsThe nation is so divided we are likely to run into problems.The ugliest scenario for the day after election day plays out if Trump wins. If Trump wins, get ready for Black Lives Matter, the Black Panthers, The Race La Raza and other racially motivated antiwhite groups to come out and possibly start burning cities down again. After all, they have been given carte blanche all year long to do so in Ferguson, Baltimore, Charlotte, and San Jose . A worrisome precedent has been set.Of course, Trump wont be in power the day after election day we have to wait until Inauguration Day for him to clean up any potential messes so Barack Hussein Obama is likely to give the racial hate groups the green light once again while the media whips out their collective Stradivarius, plays my heart bleeds for thee, and sympathizes with the devils destroying the nation.If The Bitch wins conservative groups may clash with leftists over rights being stripped awayIf Hillary wins, theres the real possibility of protests the day after the election, and the social conditioning of whites to be polite and docile even as theyre railroaded in what was formerly their nation may not hold this time around. A Hillary win means the chaos and possibly violence could wait until she starts stripping constitutional rights away. Then, we are likely to see conservatives finally come out and start raising some righteous hell. There could be racially motivated clashes on the horizon as white people standing up for themselves goes against a longestablished narrative that theyre all evil racists.Few people think of the effects civil unrest could have on their livelihood and wellbeing. Its time for a little education on just how thinly stretched the American supply chain is, and what could happen with only a shortterm disruption in it.Heres a scenario  just one of many possible scenarios. Video of rioters stopping and then looting a semi tractortrailer in Charlotte is worrying because if trucks stop, America stops. If attacks on truckers happen often enough, truckers may decide its not worth the risk to their lives to continue moving freight around and stop driving. Within a day, bedlam could ensue as the supply chain runs on a razors edge in modern America and everything from food to medication to gasoline starts running out.Supply Chain Rioters broke into trucks on I85 and burned cargo in CharlotteAccording to the American Trucking Association ATA a disruption of 24 to 48 hours means hospitals and nursing homes would run out of food. Fuel supplies at gas stations would also run out in that time frame. Garbage would start to pile up. Most grocery and retail stores would start to run out of food and merchandise. ATM and bank cash supplies would also run out.The tight rope the corporate system walks quickly breaks when merchandise stops moving.As an example, the ATA tells us this is what happens during a hurricane. Imagine what would happen with days or weeks of rioting in major cities.In a hurricane situation, supplies that would normally last a few days, such as water, powdered milk, and canned meat, typically disappear within one day. Given these inventory rates, this means that perishable goods could be depleted in a matter of days and nonperishables in just a few days. Runs on food and nonfood staples during hurricanes, and even before big winter storms, provide a good example of how fast some retail inventories can be depleted during panic buying. The same quick depletion of inventories could occur if trucks stopped making deliveries for any reason.Panic buying means no food on the shelves. When people dont have food at home and then the grocery store doesnt have food, rioting will intensify. Things could get ugly in a hurry as one small disruption leads to a domino effect, after which Bedlam ensues.So, it is best to be prepared with nonperishable items just in case things get out of hand. Have at least several weeks food supply on hand. But, how do you stop people from coming and taking your stashBe Armed The police wont be around to protect you if Bedlam ensuesContrary to gun propaganda from the media , you absolutely want to be armed in the event the election and its aftermath dont pass peacefully. What happens when stores no longer have food and gas stations no longer have gas Gangs form looking for homes that do have those items.Theyre going to pick out the weakest home in the neighborhood and pounce.A home with guns is a safe home. Just as this YouTube video shows , armed thugs may bust into a house looking for money or food, but they started jumping through plate glass windows and scrambling like cockroaches once the homeowner came out with guns blazing.Several handguns with extra ammunition are advised. Know how to use them. Be steady with the trigger. And dont be afraid to use them if looters come to your house.The police will NOT be there to protect you as theyll have their hands full with the chaos.Better To Be Safe Than Sorry The idea of an intact nuclear family may be a trite memory, but protecting your loved ones is still keyWith the meltdown of America happening right before our very eyes, we are entering an unstable period in the nations history, to say the least. No matter who wins the election the nation we once knew and loved is passing away. Trump may be able to turn things around temporarily, but even if he does the country now has so many immigrants it will be impossible to assimilate them all.We are entering a period in which America will resemble a third world country more and more. The demographics of the nation are being changed on purpose so white people are diminished at the ballot box and Democrats will gain a lock grip on the levers of power in the nation in the coming years . Divisions between rich and poor will grow, and the evil media will be there stirring the pot with racial, class, and gender division every step of the way . Peace will become a thing of the past as squabbling factions compete with each other for dominance.In this transition from prosperity to despotism, it is best to be safe than sorry. The day after election day will be telling in that it will set the tone for the next four years. It may be a somewhat peaceful turn towards Communism if The Bitch wins, or it may not be.But my money is on a steady degradation of civil society in the coming years. Tend your own garden, as I know I will be tending my own. My military friends are already discussing what will happen in SHTF scenario.

"Return of Kings has a great variety of information about many subjects improving your social life , health and fitness , tourism , among several others. Still, our political perspectives might be offputting to some readers on the left. Although you could tune out whatever you dont agree with. you might do well to take a closer look. Not all of us agree on everything, but we do have a rough consensus on some items.Our views on the political establishment The left blames corporations while the right blames the government, when in reality the two interests work together to subvert the will of the peopleIts pretty easy to see that this site has a mainly conservative perspective, especially on social matters. Not all of us started out that way. Many of us began our journey away from the political orthodoxy after realizing what a mess feminism has made of society. Others have been turned off by political correctness. Once upon a time, I used to be liberal, and I know Im not the only one. Be that as it may, some of us are actually friendly to liberalism .By the way, we dont give a free pass to the mainstream conservative establishment either. Unfortunately, the government in countless ways seeks to amass power for itself while producing fear and dependency in the populace. Really, its not a Democrat problem or Republican problem theyre basically two sides of the same coin. Heads, they win tails, you lose.Surely youre in favor of progress. One good question, though, is what exactly this constitutes . Also, who gets to define what is progress All that might seem rhetorical, but these are important matters. Likely you see change as a good thing. But whos setting the agenda, deciding which direction that change goes Actually, we have answers for all that.In fact, we might have some more in common with you than you expect. Dont care for agribusiness Neither do we . Are you troubled by the influence of the ultrawealthy in the political process We are too . Do you suspect that the powerful have set up a system of managed democracy, where theyre pulling the purse strings of both the Republicans and the Democrats If you supported Bernie Sanders, youve probably figured that one out already We understand you.Todays political and social scene You might be disenchanted by some of the things going on with the Democratic Party today. Perhaps youve heard of their hypocrisy and contempt for the public . Are you troubled by some of the Clinton scandals, maybe even wondered if there was more to it than you expected Perhaps your questioning goes deeper you might wonder who hijacked liberalism . It once stood for helping the working man, but some time in the 1960s it turned into so much squabbling divisiveness. Actually, theres a reason for that  the culture war began long before the 1990s That wasnt about liberation, but rather a deliberate attempt to spread divisiveness and weaken the fabric of society.Also, taxpayers have spent untold money on social programs, but why dont they solve problems Instead, they create intergenerational poverty. You might be shocked to learn that encouraging dependency, along with taxing and spending to oblivion, was actually a stratagem meant to crash the system . Thats not about helping the disadvantaged its about using them Schemes like thesecausing societal upheaval so a Socialist paradise will magically fall into placeare pretty reckless.You might shake your head in bewilderment at online mobs of misguided youths spewing bile about things that dont really matter. Sure, youre against police brutality as am I, but deep down you also fear what will come of all this open contempt for the law and violence against police . The authorities take a pretty dim view of cop killers kind of sounds like someone behind the scenes wants to start a lot of trouble, doesnt itFinally, you might wonder if the people on top of the liberal establishment really give a damn about the common people. We think its rotten that theyre using so many wellmeaning people for the cynical ends of amassing money and power.Likely you have some nagging concerns about whats going on in society today. Why are women both liberated and spoiled , and sometimes even hostile Cant the feminists see that things arent really so bad  Sure, youre all about tolerance and have lots of gay friends, but you privately wonder if there should be sensible limits . You might be uncomfortable with all the evangelizing of alternative lifestyles, especially if you have children in school.You consider the press to be the bedrock of a free society, but you have doubts about journalistic integrity .

"  Donald Trump Is The Candidate For Americans, Not Special Interests Donald Trump Is The Candidate For Americans, Not Special Interests Luke Stranahan Luke Stranahan is an engineer by trade and an armed patriot by inclination. He writes for Return of Kings as a leisure pursuit and an attempt to do his part to help reverse the slide into moral decrepitude of modern society. Follow him on Twitter. November 2, 2016 Politics Next Tuesday is the American election, and, for better or for worse, well pick the next President at that time assuming we dont get mired in voter fraud and recounts, and well either brace for government mandated SJW enemas or bask in a temporary setback of those evil people. But, today, I want to talk on Trump once to match an article from last week, and I intend to focus on how he is the American candidate, as opposed to the special interest groups one. I had a conversation last week with some people who acted as SJWs, but were later presented by a mutual friend as libertarian. The discussion immediately went nasty, with my opposition painting Trump and anyone who supported him as a racist and a bigot. Upon trying to determine why two of the lefts ubiquitous labels were applied to me this time, I learned that their perspective was, unless you were universally for all special interest groups, you were a bigot or a racist. False Dichotomy And The American Nightmare The problem, I found out, was that these people have distilled the political spectrum down into a black or white situation. Either you want all refugees here from the Middle East, all the Hispanics from any country south of the border to come here freely and citizenship for those already here, and that any black people shot by police are just misunderstood and were turning their lives around, or youre a racist. Theres simply no middle ground. They dont understand that Trump is not a special interest candidate, by which I mean that he is not going to put any minority group ahead of the rest of us at our expense, but he is not racist towards minorities, or sexist towards women. It is possible to be against illegal immigration, but treat Americans of Hispanic ancestry as valued citizens whom you will represent. It is possible to be against feminism, Affirmative Action, and the persecution of men for the profit of women, yet still value American women as Americans themselves. It is possible to note that some black people cause a disproportionate amount of crime, yet note that some police are racist, and see that there are bad and good cops AND bad and good black people. The American Dream is that all men are created equal, and thats men as in humanity, not just males. It is not that all men are equal, and theres a big difference to note here. You have the same opportunities as everyone else when you are born with the exception of disability, and I do not know anyone, myself included, that is against governmental aid for the disabled. What we have, instead, is the American Nightmare, where the left uses government and taxes for the most inane of causes, trying to fix any disadvantaged groups lot, real or imagined, so that things will be better. They take from the producers, and give to the nonproducers so that, according to their idealistic vision, they will suddenly become productive members of society or become addicted to the welfare tit and vote Democrat for the rest of their lives. The Good Of The Country Over That Of The Individual Long gone are responsible Democrats like Kennedy who told us to ask what you can do for your country. Every recent Democratic President, from Carter to Obama, and most of the Democrat Congressmen, view the working middle class of the country as simply a group to exploit for their pet special interest groups. Trump is the first candidate in a long time who isnt for the blacks, or the gays, or the Muslims, or the feminists, or whatever, and that matters a lot. The reason why not being for a special interest group which is ALL that Hillary is for, with her youth vote, black vote, womens vote, gay vote, etc. is so important is that these groups, even put together, do not matter when it comes down to the good of the country. Dont get me wrong, theres plenty of good, hardworking black people, just like theres the same for women, and for gays, and for young people, but these hardworking folks from all these groups arent going to be part of the BLM, or La Raza, or Lamda, because theyre too busy being productive Americans. Activism is for unemployed people. Whats going to happen if we dont placate BLM and just ignore them They riot a bit more and some get arrested What if we told them that people that commit crimes to protest being treated like they commit a lot of crimes is assbackwards thinking and counterproductive to their goals Theyd quit rioting. What would happen if we shut the Mexican border down to illegal immigration, but made a straightforward, but strict, path to citizenship for Hispanics that wanted to be citizens What if we said, this is America, we appreciate your culture and encourage to preserve it and your language in your children, but the national language IS English, and all business and schooling will be done in it, and in it only, and its your choice to not learn it, but the difficulties that will arise from that choice are all on you Theyd be Americans, proud of their heritage and their legal immigration and citizenship as well. What would happen if we told gay people that its cool if they have civil unions under the law, and have the same rights as everyone else, but its not cool trying to pick a fight with a Christian bakery to make the government hall monitor come drive them out of business just because their belief in their God and that youre sinning makes you uneasy and worried that they might actually be right What if we told them its ok to do whatever you want with another consenting adult, but you dont have to try to make fiveyearolds decide if theyre gay or straight when they shouldnt be wondering about that till puberty hits Theyd be normal Americans who just happen to like sex with the same gender, and theyd quit pushing their agenda and being obnoxious and in the rest of our faces. What would happen if we talked to Muslims and said that there is a huge, deafening, silence when it comes to the subject of Islamic Terrorism from them that makes it hard to trust any of them What if we told them that we needed their help to bring the religion out of its tacit acceptance and support of terrorism, and part of that help means supporting us vetting Muslims coming here more strictly until they are no longer statistically more likely to be terrorists than people of other religions and ethnicities Theyd go along with that and maybe realize were fixing a problem, not hating a people. What would happen if we told women that feminism has all but killed modern marriage due to universal punishment of divorced men and that no punishment for falserape accusers both makes men not trust women and insults any real rape survivor What would happen if we told them that giving them jobs for their genitalia over their skills is destroying industries by lowering the only standard that matters, that of merit that of excellence What if we told them that gender ratios and quotas may fix the macro view of sexism, but make the man passed over for the position solely because you were female pissed as all hell towards women and, when you do that to the majority of men, youll be just as successful, and just as hated by men as men were and were hated by you in years past Theyd realize that its not a competition, its a cooperation, and maybe skill should be valued over sex. What would happen if we stopped all these divisive issues that really dont do anything other than tear us apart and work on a better economy, on rights for all, on border security What would happen if we simply looked at each other as Americans, and put us, all of us, first What would happen if we ripped out the crap in the Federal government that overtaxes people, or deploys armed forces against our own countrymen What would happen if we made the Supreme Court Constitutional again, and made term limits a reality for Congress Maybe we could get a government for, by, and of the people again. Maybe America can indeed by great again like the man says. Conclusion Im not in a special interest group. No President, outside of George W. Bush right after the September 11th attacks, that I can recall since my childhood, has been for me as an American. Ive always been someone to be taxed, to be disarmed, to be hated, to be blamed. Its not racism or bigotry to want us all to be treated as equals and not be penalized for real and imagined wrongs that occurred in the past before I was born, or more recently yet with which I had nothing to do. Im not part of the problem. Im an American the people who say I am part of the problem are the problem. Their candidate, mired in scandal, corruption, and treason, is Hillary Clinton. Mine, with a message of hope for the country, not just some groups in it, is Donald Trump.",hate
"Whether you are looking to attract a longterm girlfriend or wife, or you are experimenting with shorterterm liaisons, learning the art of seduction is essential. Reams of content have been written on the topic, both on ROK and elsewhere indeed, its possible to get lost in a tsunami of pickup advice.But while it can be useful to absorb successful peoples techniques, a shortcut is to observe their habits and adopt them yourself. To that end, here is a list of the top five habits Ive observed in men who are great with women.1. They take every opportunity Guys who are great with women recognize and take up every opportunity that is presented to them. In this way they are somewhat akin to entrepreneurs. They know that the market is in a constant state of flux, and that change is at the heart of opportunity. As such, like the speculators of pussy they are, they are never afraid to launch a takeover bid, regardless of the circumstances.Game writers will often advise men that they should be approaching all the time. I would wholeheartedly endorse this. I would also add that however many opportunities youre taking now, there are always more to be had. I, for example, will try to get my first approach of the day in in the morning while Im traveling to my office on the subway. There are so many cute girls on their way to work in London or any reasonablysized commuter city and yet guys wont talk to them, rationalizing that it is too early, shell think Im crazy or whatever. In actual fact, Ive probably taken more phone numbers and set up more dates through morning approaches than at any other time.So next time you are out and about and see an attractive girl, be sure to approach her whatever the time or the circumstances. It is only by being present and open to all prospects that you will truly optimize your game.2. They notice and follow up on IOIs While most game advice is centered on what the guy should do in order to attract the girl, the fact remains that there will be many times that girls will shoot you socalled indicators of interest, or IOIs, without you having done anything.While I would never advise anyone to rely on these as a mainstay, I would counsel that you should always at least do your best to notice them, and to follow up with alacrity. Not only do direct IOIs frequently lead to sex, but also, if you fail to pursue a potentiallyinterested girl you may find yourself regretting it for a long time afterwards. Men, after all, are the more romantic gender. There are few more lasting selfinflicted wounds than the thought of that beautiful girl who smiled at you at the museum and who you just know you could have dated, had you had the courage to speak to her.The successful seducer is always on the lookout for IOIs, therefore, and hell execute quickly when he gets them, even if it means deviating slightly from his routine. For example, a while back I was on a subway train when I got strong direct eye contact from an attractive, petite and very feminine brunettejust my type. Once youve been in the game a while you will learn to distinguish a solid IOI from casual interest, but the best way to describe it is as that rabbit in the headlights look that girls give when they are truly smitten.Well, she was giving me that look and I knew I had to follow up. When she got of the train I went right after her, introduced myself on the platform, took her number and then left. A drink and then several awesome sex sessions ensued later. Had I not taken the time to go after her then we would never have connected.Remember always be willing to go after a sure thing, and never leave money on the table.3. They stand out from the crowd Every truly successful seducer I have ever known has found ways to differentiate himself and stand out from the crowd. This can manifest itself in many ways, but primarily Im talking about standing out physically in terms of what you wear and standing out in terms of your personality.While the old concept of peacocking is rightly maligned by both men and women these days, there can nevertheless be little argument with the fact that, all else being equal, the better dressed man will be more successful than his slacksandsweatshirt counterpart. A former colleague of mine who has slept with more women than anyone else Ive ever met was particular about his clothes to the point of obsession.I appreciate that this will immediately cause some people to question his masculinity what real man takes so much care over his clothes but remember that narcissism is one of the three dark triad characteristics that are like catnip to women along with Machiavellianism and psychopathy. Therefore, taking time to select a silk pocket square that contrasts dramatically with your blazer plus the right trousers and shoes will help your cause a lotif you remember that your main aim is to stand out rather than blend in.Your personality, too, should be larger than life. Dont be obnoxious, but as a rule of thumb try to ensure that you are louder and have more to say than the other men in the group.4. They are dominant There can be no doubt that women are attracted to masculine men, and that means that to be a contender you need to be dominant. Now of course, the massive and blatantly obvious caveat here is that you should also be ultimately respectful and appreciate that no means no. Nevertheless, within these boundaries it will serve you well to ensure that your body language, your tone of voice and your general demeanor communicates dominance  both of the woman you are interacting with as well as any men in your vicinity.The key thing here is to appear decisive and unwaveringeven if secretly you arent. For example, after youve had a couple of drinks with a girl on a date, try getting up, taking her by the hand and simply leading her to a taxi. When she questions what youre doing just say were going back to my place to watch a movie. Doing this will communicate that you have had similar success with women before and that you are not intimidated by her.Now, in the back of your mind you may well be uncertain that she will acquiesce and thats fine  just do the actions anyway and see what happens. Shes much more likely to want to go home with you if you demonstrate leadership and even if she doesnt, she will still respect you more which will pay dividends the next time you meet.5. They dont apologize Highly successful seducers never apologizeor certainly not for minor social infractions anyway. The fact of the matter is you cant make an omelette without breaking eggs. If you are the kind of guy who frequently approaches women while demonstrating leadership and a certain kind of cockyfunny humor then the chances are youre going to offend someone every so often.Now, Im not recommending that you should be a dickbe classy and convivial in all your interactions. But the truth of the matter is that the real seducer always ruffles a few feathers in his quest for vaginal Valhalla. If someone gets offended then make a joke but dont apologize. As long as have acted lawfully then you have nothing to be sorry for.Remember, an apology is a submission to someone elses frameand that is never a good look.Want to find out how to approach and seduce sexy girls Buy my bestselling book, The Seven Laws of Seduction .

"not since the miniskirt has there been something worn by so many women who should never have it on in the first place  Alan Sorrentino, a sexagenarian gay man, in his letter to a local Rhode Island newspaperA senior citizen and selfdescribed short, little gay Italian in Rhode Island has been the victim of a vicious intimidation campaign by feminists with too much time on their hands. After he wrote a newspaper letter saying that women over 20 should not wear yoga pants, the backlash against Alan Sorrentino was vitriolic. 300 women marched on his home, which was publicly shared, using the excuse that it was just a neighborhood protest.In retaliation for exercising his First Amendment rights, which you might have incorrectly thought encouraged violence given the heavyhanded feminist response, Sorrentino received threatening calls and explicit death threats. Publications such as The Washington Post regarded the shameful intimidation of an old man as some kind of fun outing. Rabid social media users and the protesters themselves also lost sight of the context of Sorrentinos letter and later comments, which pointed out that men rocking up to supermarkets in Speedos would be considered inappropriate, too.Violent gay man whose fashion prescriptions in a newspaper reaching only a few thousand people are capable of disemboweling feminists and ejecting them into space.If anything, the moronic march on Sorrentinos home and throughout his neighborhood demonstrates the paucity of real issues women have to complain about. For all the talk of the misogyny and patriarchy that triggered the march pun intended, these women were able to assemble freely in one of the most liberal states in America and harass, without interruption, an old white male, albeit not a straight one. They evidently did not feel the fear they continually reference in their diatribes. Where were the Saudistyle female dress code police or the rape squads of the rape culture they always talk about to teach them a lesson Alas, the dastardly misogyny and patriarchy must have chosen to remain invisible againWomen tell men what to wear all the time I didnt see anyone staking out Jennie Prices home for telling her husband and other men what to wear. Image attribution Martin Spaven.It goes without saying that one of the biggest criticisms leveled by women towards their boyfriends or husbands is their allegedly bad fashion sense. Even beyond their relationships, women have a penchant for sticking their noses into what a man wears, from his sporting clothing and clubbing attire to his choice of bathing suit. Here in Australia, an entire media subindustry emerged to criticize our former conservative Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, for wearing socalled budgie smugglers whilst swimming and keeping fit.Because Alan Sorrentino had 300 women obviously stalk his home for his fashion comments, should men have stalked the residence of one Jennie Price, a hack journalist from The Daily Mail  Instead of celebrating her husbands decision to resist middleage decline and obesity through cycling, Price penned a ridiculous piece in 2014 decrying socalled MAMILs middleaged men in lycra.She joined BBC journalist Dominic Casciani, who equated men taking up the amateur sport with a midlife crisis . Notwithstanding that men in lycra wouldnt get I or my readers off, at least men wearing this fabric actually engage in exercise when they don it in the morning, too, when fewer folks are awake to see them. By contrast, yoga pants seem to be the default female fashion option for nonexercise more than physical exertion or even yoga.Naturally, had just three guys , let alone 30 or 300, made their intention to protestcycle their way through Jennie Prices neighborhood in Britain, the police would have been called. The same can be said of any of the countless female journalists and female fashion experts who have opined on what men should or should not wear. And lets not forget women telling each other what to wear. A number of females make their careers out of critiquing what other women wear, especially on the celebrity red carpet. I wonder how many times, for example, then zombie and now dead zombie Joan Rivers found her home marched on by offended feminists after she berated either a piece of female fashion attire or the women wearing it.Sending a tweet is violence but 300 people marching on someones house is notwhat world do we live in The national debt Nah. Terrorism Nah. Urban crime Nah. These folks are protesting fashion comments.At the start of this year, I brought you the story of Holly Michelle Wood , a putrid Harvard PhD candidate and feminist, who went around calling white people awful. After the now banned Milo Yiannopoulos simply retweeted Woods criticisms of him, fellow feminist Catrin Cooper used the cyber violence argument and tried to get a Twitter stooge, Michael Margolis, to alert its founder, Jack Dorsey. We would not have the time to go through even a relatively small fraction of the other instances in which women who cannot argue their position online reframe criticism as misogyny or even outright violence.As Alan Sorrentino clearly feared for his safety during the march, potentially hundreds or thousands of women gave themselves excuses for calling some man disagreeing with them online or in person violent. A climate now exists where whatever words certain women finds offensive becomes the basis for stopping whatever theyre doing presumably not much and going after the person saying them in the most organized and appalling fashion.At a minimum, the target of their fury must lose his job, reputation, and sense of personal safety to satiate their desire for revenge. In the meantime, the very act of their protest and abuse, which is not interfered with, validates the idea that women are not the targets of systematic hate or oppression in society.As a gender, women, particularly the middle and upper middleclass women who seem to dominate these kinds of pointless, abusive protests, have nothing to complain about. Except maybe having too much time on their hands.Read More Yoga Pants CEO Is Attacked For Speaking The Truth About Fat Women ",hate
"Home This Month Popular 6 Things Indian Guys Have To Understand When Learning Game 6 Things Indian Guys Have To Understand When Learning Game February 3, 2013 164 Comments Culture As a guy of Indian ethnicity there are some obstacles you have to overcome in order to have a balanced game. Circumstances can dictate what these are but following my last post a red pill infused Indian pal of mine and myself had a conversation about what these obstacles are 1. Let go of limiting beliefs about being an Indian in the Western world What do I mean by limiting beliefs There is a particular mindset among Indian guys that they can only get with Indian girls. You must let go of these fears dictating that your ethnicity holds you back in what you can do. Being Indian does not mean you have to work in IT, accounting, business, construction or own a corner shop as in the same way it does not mean you have to date Indian girls. 2. Let go of your mummys sari Its something Ive noticed among the large Indian community here in London there are a large number of mummys boys, men who are afraid to stand up to their mothers and what they want themselves. No one wants to disrespect their parents but also at the same time standing up for what you want should be your primary objective. Many a man will settle with their girlfriends due to pressure from their mothers. As one acquaintance said, he preempted conflict by just doing what his mother wanted, even though he does not love the girl he married. 3. Let go and expand beyond your Indian comfort zone Your extended family plays a large part of your life not a bad thing, but a lot of guys also have their friends circle exclusively Indian. Expand your knowledge, gain new friends, travel, and learn new languages. Its a difficult transition to move from becoming over reliant on this little setup to independence from all influence, but it can be done and it will benefit your internal well being. The thing to remember is you are the average of the five people you spend most of your time with. It is highly likely none of your existing five friends will agree with your path into game. They will tell what is best for you but in essence this is them subconsciously pulling you back down to their value as you increase your own. 4. Stop putting white women on a pedestal White women are easy, white women are fun, white women are flirts, white women are great at sex or white women are sluts. Whatever white women are, as an Indian guy you must stop putting them on a pedestal for being all these sexually related things that you think Indian girls are not. There is no magical things that white women do that others do not. Besides, there is not a certain place in the world where white women will see you and jump on your cock as there is not a certain Bollywood film that will make a white woman gush all wet and demand you ravage her Aryan style. White woman pedestalization can be categorized as an inferiority complex displayed by Indian men. Stop thinking youre inferior to any woman regardless of her ethnic/racial origins. 5. Understand that Indian girls are not different and are not more chaste Being constantly around these Indian girls at family gatherings, community events and religious events makes you programmed into believing that you will marry one for certain because of their chaste and low promiscuity. A strong belief that Indian girls dont ride the cock carousel is blind faith because they do. In fact, all women in the western world do regardless of culture and their strong family traditional values. They are women, they get pussy tingles to the same game as white, black, Asian, orange, maroon and kiwi women. They have the same subconscious processes as all women that help them place a value on a man and inevitable slamming and spunk gobbling if he passes with flying colors. In a Western society these girls have the same external pressures and influences that appeal to their inner slut as much as any other woman. Your objective as a man is not to fall into the line of romantic thinking that they are different. 6. Do not be afraid of The Man Theres a man, a dominant man, somewhere in your family. He dictates, he dominates, and he makes the decisions. You have a fear of causing him displeasure. You do as he says as hes done the leading since your father emptied his ball sack into your mother. Stop. As much as a lot of Indian men have pressures from being mummys little lad, theres plenty of them that disintegrate under the pressure of their fathers or uncles. Avoiding conflict is prevalent in your attitude, you do as you are told even though your mind is telling you this is not in your interest and possibly not in the wider interests of those close to you but you do it, as Uncle or Dad has told you to. No one is telling you to fight, but start slowly, speak out, say what you think is best for you, get out of your shell and decide how you will live your life, not how Dad thinks you should live your life. You might be scared of the conflict and dissuade yourself from it but trust me when you finally grow some balls and exude some confidence and ability in yourself, these men will respect you, see you as equal, and place trust in your decisions. This list could also apply to other cultures who follow similar dynamics to Indian culture, but dont stop at the above and think thats all you have to doyou still have to hit the ground running and approach just like any other guy learning game.",hate
"Anyone whos been involved in the manosphere for long enough knows about the concept of a rite of passage. For tens of thousands of years, when boys hit the age of puberty, they were forced to undergo a set of challenges.These challenges were meant to break them down, and build them back up even stronger. These challenges were meant to test them as men, and they are collectively known as an initiation, or as a rite of passage. When a boy successfully completed the tasks laid before him, he became a man.Our society, for the most part, lacks these rites of passage. This is, in large part, why there is such a lack of masculinity in our culture boys are never given a chance to develop into men. We have all of these 45 year old boyishmen running around for a reason there exists no institutionalized rite of passage in the West.Despite this, however, I believe that learning game is a form of initiation. It contains all of the traits necessary to turn a boy into a man. It teaches boys to develop selfconfidence , despite what women think of them, to become decisive and assertive, and to remain persistent and cultivate strength of will.Death Of The Ego One of the primary functions of a rite of passage, is that it destroys a boys ego. This is necessary, for in order for him to become a man, his identification with boyhood must be destroyed. In other words, he must cease to view himself as a boy, and come to view himself as a man.This is, in a nutshell, what most of the rites of passage were designed to dothis is why many of them simulated death, in a rather bellyofthewhaleesque fashion. One rite of passage, of the Aborigines to be specific, entailed kidnapping a young boy from his mother.When a boy would reach the age of puberty, the men of the village would sneak into his home during the night and kidnap him his mother would put on a big show, screaming and fighting, to make it seem realistic. The men would blindfold the boy and take him to the middle of the woods.He would then spend the next several months undergoing challenges he would not see a single woman for this period of time. This sudden yanking from the motherworld, of safety, and being thrust into the fatherworld of dangerous challenges, symbolized his death as a boy.When the boy returned home, he would view himself as a man. He would carry himself taller, he would interact with the women differently, and he would have a new sense of purpose. In many ways, as I will soon explain, game does all of these things for the men willing to learn it.Facing Fears Many of these challenges that boys were forced to face involved overcoming their fears. Fear of death, fear of the unknown, and fear of failure were all overcome during these rites of passage. As an example, one Native American rite of passage involved making a boy sit, blindfolded, on a tree trunk for three days straight.Imagine his fear as he heard the various animals during the night the howling, the cawing, and the roaring of the animals alone would be enough to terrify even the bravest of men. Then, add in the elements of cold and wind, the bugs that must have crawled over his feet, and the fear of a rival tribe member killing him, and it becomes very apparent how brave the men of the past must have been.Then, once three days had passed, a man of the village would come and remove the boys blindfold. This, again, is symbolic of his rebirth for three days straight, he was blind and helpless. Then, his vision returned and he emerged a new man.All throughout the rites of passage of history, whether they be of the Inuits, the Amazon tribes, or the South African tribes, there are some very common characteristics facing your fear, being reborn, and coping with uncertainty are all critical parts of these initiations.Why Were These Rituals Necessary Upon contemplation, it becomes very clear why these rituals were necessary. The world that we live in is radically different than the world that our ancestors lived in. A tribe of weak men meant extinction there was no military, or safety. If the men could not protect the tribe, it would not be protected.Imagine, right now, if a marauding band of 25 vandals roamed into your neighborhood. They were all extremely jacked, mean looking, and each one was carrying some sort of weapon a baseball bat, a stick, or a crowbar. Do you think that you and your neighbors would have the balls to fight them offYou, being a reader of ROK, may very well fight a noble fightbut your neighbors I seriously doubt that a purplehaired, complaining, selfcastrating feminist man would be of any use during a battle such as this.Now, try to imagine that this sort of thing happened fairly regularly for our ancestors. It was not uncommon for neighboring tribes to frequently attack you, so it was an absolute necessity that the men be trained for battle. But, being trained for battle requires more than physical strength.It requires ferocity, it requires strength of will, decisiveness, assertiveness, and a complete lack of fear. These are the characteristics that rites of passage were meant to breed, for without them, a tribe would go extinct.Are These Rituals Still Necessary Someone might point out that we arent at war anymore, so these rituals arent necessary. Although I agree that we arent in a state of constant warfare anymore, I still believe that these rites of passage are extremely necessary. Heres why.Men and women both have distinct psychological makeups there is no denying this, no matter how hard the Marxists cry and clamor. Men and women are different. Boys have an inherent desire to be a part of something greater than themselves, namely a tribe. Boys have an inherent desire to be welcomed into the world of menand we arent getting it, because there isnt even a world of men anymore.The once sacred separation of the genders has been desecrated. Only a select handful of mens organizations still exist the manosphere, the Freemasons, and various other spiritual organizations. It used to be commonplace for gentlemans organizations to exist everywhere, but theyve become a thing of the past.This is why, in large part, were experiencing such a crisis of masculinity men dont know who they are anymore. We dont have any healthy male role models. All weve got is weak men who justify their weakness with feel good aphorisms. We want more, but we dont get more.Any man who is attuned to this can feel it he can feel the general sense of boyishness that the adulthood of men seems to hold onto. Theres no chance for us to prove ourselves. Theres no dragons to slay, no enemies to fight off, and no fears to overcome.And were suffering. We can feel it in our bones. Not only are men unnecessary, but we dont even have opportunities to grow and develop like the men of the past. We dont have any initiations or male guidance no men to reassure our belonging in the tribe, no obstacles to face.Learning Game The New Initiation I believe that, although it isnt perfect, game is a phenomenal substitute for this lack of a male initiation ritual. Game provides us with many of the characteristics that you need to be a man, and it has many of the characteristics that the old rituals of the past didDestroys your ego Requires you to face your fears Forces you to be decisive, in times of uncertainty Develops confidence, ferocity, and a strong will Again, obviously game isnt perfect. One could certainly make the argument that ones masculinity shouldnt be contingent upon what women think, and I agree 100. But do you know what You may get into game for womens approval, but any seasoned player knows that you actually STAY in the game for your own personal growth.When men first start learning game, they get into it because their sex life isnt what they want it to be.

First off, game demolishes your ego . A lot of men have this delusion that they could get any hot girl that they want, but they are forced to face reality when they actually go out and try to pull girls.This is why so many men hate game, and cant handle it youre forced to face reality very quickly, and most men cant take this. When you start to go out and learn game, you have one of two choicesAccept that you suck with girls, and keep trying to improve Viscerally deny reality and perpetuate your delusions by never going out and experiencing rejection Most men choose the latter.

"Lately, gunfree zones and gun control laws are all the rage among the globalists and liberals of all shapes usually circular and sizes .Those measures, solely aimed at disarming the people and depriving them of the sacred right to defend themselves, has shown its vast ineffiency, with gun victims and terrorist attacks on the rise in those zones since no honest citizen can shoot back to stop the massacre.Here is why I propose, once a conservative government reaches the White House, to create Fat Control Laws F.C.L and ObesityFree Zones O.F.Z as obesity is indeed a more serious threat to the lives of Americans than honest citizens carrying legally purchased guns. Here are six potential benefits1. Simple philanthropy Obese people are delusional thinking that it is great to be a useless sack of shit. Nowadays, they get fed a distorted reality saying that big and round is beautiful when the natural reaction, deeply branded in our DNA, is disgust, mockery and suspicion.Fat and sedentary lifestyles kill much more than guns . The war against obesity is as important as the war on crime or drugs. Bovine people not only harm themselves but others too. By creating measures to prevent them from becoming fat or exhorting them lose weight, we are helping our common man to preserve his dignity as a human being.In their case, sugar and salt create a dopamine rush and an addiction loop very similar to an addiction to opiates. We must show our potbellied or barrelbellied junkies the way as they cant take the steps themselves.Just like with restrictions on cigarettes, if they are stupid enough to gorge themselves on calories, we must conclude that there is a severe lack of judgement on their part and prevent them from purchasing the source of their misery.2. Preserving aesthetics and other senses No more eyesore of seeing fatties rolling around everywhere you go. Imagine a beach with a plethora of more feminine, attractive and thin women by banning whales in bikinis.Our nostrils would also be free of the olfactory offence that they throw in our faces. Say goodbye to the pungent smell of fat rolls sweat at your local grocery store.No more 280lb SJW land whales with laboured breath sounds in waiting rooms or uncontrolled farting in the public transport like you are in a cattle train. It could be tomorrow.3. Positive impact on children I do not want these people to roam free and that my future progeny can witness it and think that this is normal. Worse, if the PC politburo tells them it is beautiful to be a beached whale. Lets send them far until they get better. Out of sight, out of mind as they say.Legal elements should be implemented against pernicious publicity aired on television and directly aimed at children, whether by the time chosen to air it or the promotion it makes of unhealthy eating.Of course, with Fat Control Policies, kids will get bullied at school. Some will cut themselves for being called fattie. So what Adapt and overcome or crawl in a ball and cry. The weakest has to be left behind if he does not want to save himself.4. A healthier population You are under arrest for being an immovable, gargantuan arseholeFat is not a silent killer. Hundreds of thousands of people die with a loud thud every year of obesityrelated diseases, a largely preventable cause of death worldwide. Today, 1 in 5 Americans and 1 in 11 Britons dies from being a fat arse with no selfcontrol.It is a fact that obesity causes death by cardiac arrest, diabetes, coronary and liver diseases, cancer, and hypertension among others. Promoting a healthy lifestyle and physical activity will create a longer life expectancy.Physically healthier people are mentally healthier too boost of selfesteem and confidence. Fat Control Laws will reduce mental health issues such as depression, inferiority complex or suicidal tendencies caused by obesity. That is also less money spent by the taxpayer5. A boost for the economy According to a 2009 report, ham planets cost the economy 117 billion a year . And that is for the American economy alone The number of human cattle is still growing exponentially. It inflicted more than a 325.8 billion loss to the economy in 2010.In 2016, we can reasonably assume that the number of obese people has grown and has impacted the wallet of your average American even harder.A fitter population, with its nutritional choices, would result in a more natural, higherquality food industry. Smaller amounts of food produced and needed, resulting in reduced resources and materials wasted during and after its production.We could see the end of excessive fossil fuel used to transport land walruses and their fat arse across long distances and hogging the space that could be use by three normal individuals.Healthier, more active people are happier, more productive and successful since the cogs of the machinery are not coated in fat. An age of stronger, selfgoverned, highenergy men bringing a healthier society. Its YUGE6. A new sexual and romantic market It will bring a more balanced sexual arena to limit the accumulation of fat. A radical answer to the phenomenon of plummeting testosterone levels caused by high fat percentage, trimming the numbers of plump omegas and sexual market voluntary rejects.Lets impose a healthier diet for higher numbers of attractive, thin and pretty women. Greater numbers of quality girls to choose from reduces aggressive competition, which decreases the bitch shields of thin, entitled girls.Endless supplies of betas queuing to capture crumbs of their attention would be a thing of the past. As I said it before, male thirst is the root of all evil when it comes to romantic competition.Sexier citizens means more relationships, a peak in libido and reproduction of physically and mentally balanced individual, helping nations suffering from low birth rate.One more element for the protection of Western society being the most affected one and its people, cementing the bases of a strong future, fighting globalism and the myth they try to sell us about global overpopulation.By logical natural process, bronies, corpulent manchildren and manga conventions should also disappear soon.The Fat Control Laws 1. Segregated ObesityFree Zones Our diabetic mammoths must be isolated from further propaganda and tasty treats.This is why we should create large VERY large fenced areas to protect the healthy subjects, as fat is more dangerous than guns.Lets pen the bigboned rejects in separated zones where access to junk food and other harmful products would be forbidden. Fresh water, open spaces, salad and treadmills as far as the eye could see.BUILD THAT FENCEWe shall call it the David Fatrelle Center for Porcine Rehabilitation2. Permits A permit would have to be issued similar to a guncarrying permit for the purchase of junk food, highcarb snacks, soda drinks etc. After a doctors physical exam of the patient, slim citizens would be delivered a permit with a stamp of approval, granting them access to supermarkets or venues where processed or junk food is served.3. Mandatory workouts Compulsory exercise would be imposed to obese people to reach a standard BMI. We could bring it up a notch where a fine could be issued after a determined period of time if the weight loss target has not been reached.A Steps Counter Activity tracker would have to be worn or installed on their smartphone and a quota of physical activity would have to be reached on a day to day basis.Just like the programs for convicted criminals or drug abusers with reports to the local police station on a regular basis, the stubbornly chunky would be followed during a rehabilitation stage and their progress monitored.4. Fat shaming Fat shaming works great, as we have seen before . Remember the shitstorm of the beach body campaign , immediately declared thought criminals by the Body Positive Lobby or Islamic Thought Tribunal of LondonistanOr the coldblooded leaflets given by anonymous though criminals to particularly adipose London Tube passengers YUGE success.Pourquoi a nexiste pas Fat people are a dead weight to society in all senses of the term and to compensate this burden, they must chip in one way or another and repair the harm they cause.Fitter people means a selfaware, powerful mass that strives for greatness.But the liberals in charge dont want that. This is why they produce massive amounts of harmful, processed food and encourage the pleb, by manipulating publicity and promoting makebelieve, to remain fat, weak and above all, docile.Its all part of a plan. Fat Control Laws are the answer to that great evil.Read More 6 Reasons To Date An Obese Girl ",hate
"  3 More Emotions Men Should Master 3 More Emotions Men Should Master Andr is a young European who left his decaying country in 2012 for greener pastures. He enjoys exploring subterranean places, reading about a host of interconnected topics, and yearns for Tradition. November 3, 2016 Mind Passions and emotions are an almost bottomless pit. Start digging there and you will find new ones, or new relations between this and that tidbit of emotional content. Socalled Enlightenment philosophers who tried to theorize the passionssomething that had been done at greater length, actually, by Thomas Aquinascould never agree on how many there were or even how much they exactly mattered in the course of life. Whether or not you have been reading my last two pieces on the topic, remember this is about mastering passions in the most general sense. This is not only about emotional restraint or seduction. Our own emotional states are the first in line, but mastering the passions is also about spotting what other people are feeling, how they can be led to a specific course of action, and what tends to make them tick. Mastering the passions is far from evident, it rather takes times and experience the concepts and directions I am providing here aim at giving some conscious clarity about things that are by nature a bit muddy. Artists, though they often suffer from mental problems, are skilled at painting a particular vision in vivid colours, allowing their public to share a specific point of view and emotional state. This is something the elite know very well. Critics trashed Ayn Rands Atlas Shrugged because they could see themselves painted there as passiveaggressive cultural parasites. Rands novel was more cogent, and attracted more heat, than her barely original philosophical pieces today sold at the cheapest price on the secondhand book market. More recently, the movie The Fall 2004 got backlashed by some of the mainstream media on the grounds that it depicted Hitler as too human. While seeing actor Bruno Ganz pondering, eating, talking to his closest company or getting angry, the viewer could perhaps feel a bit of empathy to him. Which is, of course, unacceptable to a Left that clings to the idea of a crazy, careless, inhuman dictator to be forever cast as an embodiment of evil. Hollywood directors do not like witnessing others competing with their own emotional mastery. We need artists, as well as qualified cultural critics, to take some distance from the mainstream propaganda disguised as entertainment and expand an alternative culture and artworks. Emotions explored in the present series can be used just that way. 1. Gratitude Gratitude denotes a trained and refined disposition. Being graceful means recognizing that the good in our life can come from something that is outside us and outside our control Neel Burton, Heaven and Hell , chap.8, p.61. It focuses on positive things we already have and that cannot be ascribed to our sole merit or efforts. The traditional world, whatever the particular cultural or religious form it was embodied into, always emphasized the necessity of being grateful. You owed your existence to God, to your family and your community. None of these goods were actually deserved, which meant you had to be grateful for them and repay them by being a dutiful member of the community as well as a dutiful father for your own children. A lot of prayers and ancient rites imply a thanksgiving for what one already has. Moving later in time, it is striking to see that modern progressivism breeds the exact opposite mindset. The ideology of rights make many goods granted, not a thank you for but an I have a right to. Neophilia the relentless pursuit of novelty always casts a bad shadow on what has been around for some time, as if what was coming later was always better. Advertisement, gossip culture, economic growth pressure, quest for victimhood lead to envy and always being more or less frustrated with what one already has, regardless of what it is. By leading us to always want more, progressivism makes us oblivious to what we already have or how it does not stem from pure individual meritand, when it flatters the ego, it makes us complacent and far from cultivating the art of being thankful. Turning our backs from the modern, ungraceful mindset is easier said than done. To start with loudmouthed girls should be remembered they owe their nice, luxurious workplaces to the men who built them, LGBTBBQ should thank their heterosexual parents and ancestors for their very lives, antiwhite black activists should remember they would not even exist had their ancestors not benefited from their white colonizers healthcare technology. Feel free to expand the list. Ultimately, I think, every person who is modern or westernized enough can be outed as ungraceful for something. 2. Trust A famous study showed that multiculturalism was closely correlated with defiance and a lack of trust in each other. Provided that we enlarge a bit our definition of multiculturalism, this absolutely makes sense. Some ethnic groups are especially prone to violence, and some minority groups are rewarded for freely accusing the silent majority, but the hegemony of political correctness made it a taboo. Communities have been fragmented by individualism, i.e. each person looking to take as much as she can, and by an antiracist white guilt that soon became an intrawhite generalized suspicion of racism. People do not identify anymore with the larger society and often cannot even identify with a smaller communitywhich makes everyone else a potential enemy. Yet, without trust, life becomes unbearable. If you cant go to the streets without the possibility of getting mugged by, say, BLM activists , or go to a family meal without the prospect of a lukewarm struggle with aging leftist parents, or have a relationship with a girl without the possibility of her making a false rape accusation , there arent a lot of things you can do on the long run. Without trust in other people, you have to trust the complex of big corporations, NGO, and State institutions we call the systemand be dependent from it for things as basic as food and shelter. Only trust in each other can make life sustainable and longterm projects workable. To recreate trust, we have to make people accountable and bound to precise rules, reward good behaviours while punishing bad ones. Actions must bear consequences. But before neomasculinity gets into power, men should strive to establish a reputation through reliability, persistence, and a strong mindset. I could wager you have been more trusting of your Facebook friends last years than of the mainstream media , the former conveying more trustworthy information than the latter. 3. Desire Modern capitalism and progressivism always ran on desire. Want cheaper prices More goods Better goods More TV channels to watch More monies More ego and thinking you are the hot shit Well, just buy in X or do some work for Y, and here it is um, nah, you just have to do some more, and some more, and some more. In the end, you forgot why exactly you are doing what youre doing, or why you started to watch TV. But it all started with you led to perform something, no matter how surreptitiously framed as spontaneous or normal it was. The system plays on desires in three ways. It sets things to be desired, things to be feared or never desired at all, and things to be consummated without end. Things to be desired include everything the advertisement wants you to desire, like a revolving credit, a new sofa, an SUV or whatever, as well as the next step of  progress  as it has been elaborated on the top of the pyramid. Things to be feared are where the system wants you to be resigned and fatalistic did you ever feel sad to see all these girls losing themselves into a sea of fat, bitching, and SJWpropaganda spouting Too bad, thats globalization, resistance is futile, move on At last, things to be consummated are mainly produced to keep you busy and programmed though you are not really practising anything beyond staring at a screen. Lately, an important shift has been happening between the first and third ways to play on desires. Decades before, the average consumer had to desire owning more junk or being part of the progress the system needed him to work and monitor his peers. Today, the junk is already everywhere, PC culture is already hegemonic, and the average American worker is no longer needed. Active desire is not needed anymore. Thus, the system has shifted into making the average Joe more passive. Instead of actually desiring more, the consumer should be content with surrogates of everythingpseudogroup identity with team sports, pseudosports with football and basket on TV, pseudosex with porn, pseudolife with video games, pseudofamily life with animals, pseudoexpertise when the average libtard obnoxiously parrots the media on everything. This is Brzezinskis tittytainment in a nutshell. Even if you dont give up on having a real life instead of a surrogate, the system will still want you to desire things only for yourself, thus retreating into individualism, instead of trying to actually weight on the world. Either you surrender to the progress or you try to ignore it before it comes for you. As if nothing could change. Dont let the elite frame the world according to its own interests. Desire selfrealization and weighting on the course of the world. Of course, our female counterparts should desire being loving, caretaking, and definitely on our side. To conclude this series Once again, it is hard to sketch in a few words what could be done with passions or emotions. What I have mostly dwelled into is how those already in power manipulate them and what we could do as to take them back. If you find the topic worthy of interest, you can expand it in two directions first, documenting yourself on a particular passion or emotion, and second, using some by stirring it with a certain aim in mind. In the former case, I would recommend Neel Burtons Heaven and Hell quoted several times in the course of this series as a point of departure. In the latter, being creative or simply assertive is up to you. Whether this looks more like efforts or selfpersuasion or artistry does not matter much. Here, as well as in seduction, a tight framing is key. Whatever the topic, no vocabulary and no picture are really neutral, which is a problem as our perception and thinking orientation are often conditioned by these. The mastery of emotions is reinforcedand reinforcesthe mastery of representations. If this sounds farfetched, let me provide some examples of use, examples you are absolutely free to expand as it suits you. In the comments space, several guys here have been giving a very negative portrayal of the nice guy he would be a fake, a sneaky bastard, a jerk. So guys who want to get laid or have their own interests, just as everyone else, are jerks This looks like internalized feminist thinking. In my opinion, nice guys should elicit empathy, which goes through a positive portrayal emphasizing their willingness to respect the girl or how they were likely raised by an unmanly culture. A recent ROK piece about mainstream media has shown how these are making a conscious effort to hide and delegimitate white victimhood they paint vividly any crime where the victim is nonwhite and the perpetrator is, but mention no detail or do not mention at all any crime perpetrated by nonwhites on whites. The same pattern appears in the movie Elysium 2013, when the of course white villain mentions children she wants to protect from a mass of brown invaders, yet these children are never shown and consequently stir no empathy from the average watcher, whereas the brownskinned are vividly depicted as humane and not responsible for their own poverty. Analyzing these phenomena is fine, but ultimately insufficient. Creative people on our side have to provide an alternative that includes mastered emotions. Picking up girls is part of, and gives some experience in, this wider game.",hate
"The following post was sponsored by Chad Cocker and written by Matt Forney Everyone says that you shouldnt judge a book by its cover, but thats really difficult when the cover makes you throw up a little in your mouth. Thats how I felt when I was tasked with writing a review of Chad T. Cockers Memoirs of a Misogynist An Erotic Novel for Men . What kind of man would want to read an erotic novel Romance and erotica are female masturbation material trying to write a Harlequin novel men is like marketing lesbian porn to actual lesbians.Or so I thought.Despite the packaging, Memoirs of a Misogynist is one of the best works Ive read this year. Contrary to Cockers marketing, the novel is a examination of life as a man in modern America, filtered through the protagonists relationships with women. While it starts slowly, Cockers prose and honesty save the day and make Memoirs of a Misogynist absolutely worth your time and money.From The Marquis De Sade To Neomasculinity Because mainstream publishing almost exclusively caters to women, underground and independent writers have turned to fill the void of malecentric literature. From braggadocios fratire writers like Tucker Max and Maddox to loser lit authors such as Andy Nowicki and Ann Sterzinger to our very own Roosh and Quintus Curtius, theres a surfeit of alternative writing for men who are sick of the misandry and feminism of the real literary world.Viewed against the backdrop of alternative publishing, Memoirs of a Misogynist is an odd animal indeed. When I first picked it up, I assumed it would be a tellall memoir along the lines of Rooshs A Dead Bat in Paraguay, or a roman  clef in the fashion of Charles Bukowskis work. However, it does indeed live up to its subtitle, as much of the novel is devoted to lengthy, detailed descriptions of the protagonists sexual encountersShed also gotten used to her chastity belt, and that scared her. It still didnt sit well with her that Master had total control over her sexual gratification. Slave was constantly wet and horny, and that made her even more compliant. The orgasms that Master gave her were unlike anything she had experienced before. They were mindblowing. Even after a year together, their sex was electric and deeply satisfying.In the introduction, Cocker warns us that the book is possibly the dirtiest, most depraved, and most offensive novel youve ever read, making me wonder if hes ever heard of 120 Days of Sodom. Still, the structure of Memoirs plot and the skill of Cockers prose shows that hes both acquainted with classic erotica and has actually had sex with a lot of girls. The first half of the book is reminiscent of Pauline Reages Story of O, in which a woman is systematically trained to become a sex slave.Interestingly, Memoirs of a Misogynist also seems inspired by Venus in Furs not the Velvet Underground song, but the erotic novel by Leopold von SacherMasoch. Its from SacherMasoch that we derive the term masochism, the tendency to derive sexual pleasure from pain akin to how sadism is derived from Sade, as the plot revolves around a man who desires nothing more than to be utterly subservient to his mistress. Severins humiliation at the hands of his lover drives him to become a misogynist in the same way that Cockers protagonist is oneThat woman, as nature has created her, and man at present is educating her, is mans enemy. She can only be his slave or his despot, but never his companion. This she can become only when she has the same rights as he and is his equal in education and work.Its worth noting that SacherMasoch was a feminist and believed that equal relationships with women would only become possible with womens liberation. Insert your own joke here.Power Doesnt Care What You Need, As Long As Youre On Your Knees Enjoying Memoirs of a Misogynist requires you to get past the initial few chapters, which read like Fifty Shades of Grey with about 30 extra IQ points. The initial plot concerns Melinda, a runaway who falls into the care of a wealthy man who goes unnamed for most of the book. After offering her room and board, the man and Melinda begin a relationship, sealed by a contract where she agrees to become his sexual playthingMy body is my Masters. It is his blank canvas, for him to modify as many times, and in as many different ways as he chooses. He could hear her breath quickening as he read. He will control my bodily functions most particularly my orgasms. I will only orgasm when my Master allows me. What saves the bookand what kept me readingwas its depiction of the protagonist henceforth referred to as Master. Far from the masturbatory blank slate that Christian Grey was, Cocker depicts Master as a complex and conflicted character, constantly trying to rationalize the way he treats Melinda later rechristened Slave. Cockers deft writing kept me wondering what the protagonists motivations were all the way to the end. The book also frequently switches to Melindas perspective while its usually a challenge for male writers to depict female characters and vice versa, Cocker is skilled enough to make her compelling as well.Where Memoirs really picks up is in the second half, which is set nearly ten years later. The focus shifts to Elizabeth Avery, a disgraced doctor stripped of her medical license after shes caught abusing a male patient. Destitute and despondent, she accepts a job as the personal physician of Masters stable of whores, his lifestyle offending her feminist sensibilitiesDoctor Averys world was spinning. She tried to distance herself. This was just a patient, after all. She was being paid a significant amount of money for this jobthe kind of money that would solve a lot of her problems. Regardless, she couldnt help but be disgusted that a woman had allowed herself to be treated this way. Hed said she consented to this. In fact, the way she looked at the man showed she clearly loved him, and was a willing participant in her modifications and degradation. The woman, or Melinda, as the man had called her, looked up at him with what the doctor could only call adoration.Once again, it would have been easy for Cocker to depict Elizabeth as a raging, braburning feminist stereotype, but he agilely avoids clichs in favor of nuance. Elizabeth isnt portrayed as a firebreathing misandrist, but as a woman who unthinkingly absorbs leftist cant and has her life ruined because of it. The final chapters of the book show Elizabeth tussling with the sexual arousal she feels working for Mr. X her name for the protagonist and her attempts to maintain her beliefs as the evidence of her failed life piles up. I wont spoil the ending, other than to say that after finishing the book, I had to sit on it and digest it for a few days.Each chapter of Memoirs begins with a factual statistic about the state of men and boys in America today, a jarring contrast with the depravity of the books action. I initially wondered why they were there, but as I approached the end of the book, it all suddenly clicked. Memoirs of a Misogynist is a biting look at what our toxic sexual marketplace does to men and women. American dating is like an acid bath no one who dives into it comes out unscathed. Even men who are successful at getting laid are affected by what they have to do to get ahead. There are no winners, no saints, and no role models just people trying to make the best of a broken system.As I stated earlier, Memoirs takes a while to really get going, and if youre not into lascivious descriptions of sex, the book wont appeal to you. But if you want a haunting, piercing look at the horror show of modern gender relations, Memoirs of a Misogynist is a mustbuy. I cant wait to see what Cocker comes up with next.Click Here to buy Memoirs of a Misogynist Advertise Your Product Or Site On Return Of Kings ",hate
"Home This Month Popular 16 Tips For Having Sex With Croatian Girls 16 Tips For Having Sex With Croatian Girls February 6, 2013 78 Comments Travel Day Game 1. Croatian girls are extremely receptive to day game. They want to be opened. Even if she has headphones and seems focused on her music, it can still go well. Same goes for girls on rollerblades Excuse me, where can I buy rollerblades like yours. 2. Croatia is one of those places where both indirect and direct game work. Pick one that suits the venue and your personality. What I did was open indirect, chat for a couple minutes, and then hit her with a compliment about her positive energy to see how shed respond. If she smiled, I knew I was in. 3. Girls will give you their number even if they have a boyfriend. It may not come out until the first meeting. To avoid this, when I was getting a number Id jokingly say, Youre not married, right If she had a boyfriend, she would then announce it with a guilty look on her face. 4. Always go for the instadate, especially if youre doing street game. Not only will this weed out flakey girls, but it gives you an opportunity to find out what she wants in life. Croatia has a lot of good girls who dont drink at all and want a serious relationship. You want to dump those prospects if youre not staying long. 5. A common issue youll find on the first date is girls who want to bring their friends along. Dont let them or youll get stuck in a hellish group chat. Its either a 1on1 date or nothing. Night Game 6. You need to push the interaction as far as you can go. If you dont at least get a kiss, the odds that number will lead to a date is 25 or less. If you get a passionate kiss with some handholding at the end, over 50. Its easy to get a number from a Croatian girl but you should resist push for the kiss. Its similar to what you should do in America. 7. Absolutely do not add a Croatian girl to Facebook. They are accomplished attention whores and will string you along. If you didnt at least get a phone number, you got nothing. 8. Cockblocking is a huge problem. The best way to fight it is to be more selective about the venues you choose. Large clubs have the hottest girls, but they are harder to approach and you will end up getting cockblocked incessantly. Hipster bars have the ugliest girls, but youll rarely get cockblocked. Experiment in the city to find something in the middle that has the best balance between beauty and attitude. So much of a successful Croatian experience will be based on the venue. Going from the best venue to the worst, you may even feel like youre in a different country. As a general rule, if youre in a club where the girls arent genuinely excited youre a foreigner, you should go somewhere else. 9. Since so many girls go out in pairs, its better to roll with a wingman than solo dolo. A problem youll face if you re going out solo is that a girl doesnt want to leave her friend alone. What I did was approach girls whose friend was already getting hit on by another guy. 10. Dont compliment at night . Croatian girls already have an elevated perception of themselves and get compliments all the time. They are not insecure as girls from the Baltics or Ukraine . 11. Dont call a girl before you bang her. They rarely answer. Text instead. 12. Croatia is slowly embracing onenight stands. With the right logistics, you should be able to get them. They are far easier than a place like Ukraine. The key here is having tight logistics. It should be so tight that you can take a walk with her and be at your place to hop in for a quick drink. The girls who are most likely to go for this will be 1823 and who want a taste of the American sexual culture. Older women will be able to resist your logistical game. 13. Similar to the above point, all your dates should be close to your apartment. If your date venue is more than half a mile away, youre already shooting yourself in the foot. Even if a Croatian girl is playing aloof, she can turn on a dime once in a private room. 14. The less snobby the club, the more acceptable it is to buy a girl a drink without getting punished for it. Croatia isnt like other Eastern European countries where girls are generally upfront and honest with their intentionsthey will play you if you give them the opportunity, especially the higher end venues.

The best game for Zagreb, the capital, is to have the best logistics possible. Sadly, Croatian girls flake more than average so you want the proximity of your apartment to act as bait for casual hangouts that turn into bangs.

"By day, I work in a scrap yard. It is not glamorous, but glamour does not pay my bills. In the evening, I teach in a welding program at a community college.Like many others, I once bought into the fallacy that you need a piece of paper from a university to succeed in life. At the age of thirty, I graduated from a university with an undergraduate degree, and the customary debt, which came along with it. Twentynine years later, I see how wrong I was.Soon after graduating, I obtained an office job and moved to a city where I knew no one. The job I was so optimistic about turned out to be like marriage to a crack whore. Each day was as if walking through a minefield full of dysfunctional women, emasculated men, drama, backstabbing, catfights, and every other problem associated with modern workplaces. Worse yet, the cut male managers allowed trim to be in charge resulting in a fucked up toxic culture. After three tumultuous and abusive years, I found myself unceremoniously kicked to the curb, and surprisingly relieved.After a lengthy stint of unemployment, I landed an entrylevel job in a metal fabrication company. One of the benefits offered was tuition reimbursement for work related classes. I enrolled in welding classes at night, and upgraded my skills, all on my employers dime.I immediately noticed a difference from my previous job. I worked exclusively with men. Except for a few token assholes, the men liked their solitude, did their jobs, and left each other alone. The work was varied, creative, and with overtime, the pay was decent. The fact that I had a work ethic, showed up every day on time, and desired to learn earned me respect quickly.I eventually went down a different path, but returned to welding parttime as an adjunct instructor.Welding is the joining of two metal pieces or parts by applying heat. A filler metal, or electrode, helps to make the joint. Power source supplies electricity required for heat, and a shielding gas or fluxcovered electrode aids in the welding process.The most common welding processes are Gas Metal Arc Welding GMAW, Flux Core Arc Welding FCAW, Gas Tungsten Arc Welding GTAW, and Shielded Metal Arc Welding SMAW. Of these, Gas Metal Arc Welding is the easiest to learn and offers the fastest production. Welding involves both Ferrous steel and Nonferrous metals aluminum, stainless steel.Why Welding 1. According to a Bureau of Labor report, the need for welders will grow by 26 percent by 2020.2. According to a National Association of Manufacturers report, nearly 81 percent of manufacturers in the United States report that they cannot find skilled welders to meet demand.3. The American Welding Society reports that the average age for a welder is now in the midfifties4. Entrylevel wages in my region average 28,00040,000 annually, with skilled welders earning 50,000 and more after five years in the trade.I frequently hear from employers who are desperate for skilled welders. One plant manager told me there are too many computer jockeys and not enough people who can weld and turn a wrench. Another manufacturer told me we have over a dozen welders retiring and no one to replace them. Further, the school I teach at has more jobs available than they have students enrolled.What Welders Do Welders work in manufacturing, construction, maintenance repair facilities, and service companies. Welders typically work eighthour shifts and a fiveday week, but overtime is common. Welders often perform other duties like operating metal fabrication equipment and doing assembly work.The more skills a welder develops, the more value and earning potential he has. For example, being able to weld, cut and fit up metals, and read weld symbols and prints will command a higher wage. Becoming certified in certain weld procedures also increases a welders wages and marketability.Qualifications Welding is the quintessential bluecollar job. It is physically demanding, hot, dirty, and requires a high degree of skill. Other personal characteristics are good eyesight and hand eye coordination, good manual dexterity, and good concentration.Training Community colleges offer affordable training for entrylevel jobs in welding. Most programs are nine months, but my school also offers a sixteenweek work ready certificate in welding. Students learn common welding processes, thermal cutting processes, and blueprint reading. Unlike the typical ivory palace college professors, instructors are required to have a minimum of three years related and verifiable industrial experience. Job placement is also good.Additional Facts Despite a decent paying skill in high demand, clueless parents and educators continue to dissuade young men from entering bluecollar trades like welding. The result has been an entire generation of young men ruined by hostile fouryear colleges, worthless degrees, and insurmountable debt.Perhaps you are a perceptive and bright young ROK reader considering a career change. In closing, consider these facts.1. You will always have employment as a welder.2. Welding skills are highly transferable. You can carry these skills to your next, and often higher paying job.3. Unlike many whitecollar corporate jobs of today, the average welders wages increase with skill. Overtime, merit increases, and production bonuses are common benefits for welders.4. At the end of your shift, you can leave your job at the door.5. Welding offers a level of creativity, solitude, and seeing the fruits of your labor. Studies show that welders, machinists, and other bluecollar trades have lower suicide rates than many whitecollar professions.6. Welding is often a gateway trade into other even higher paying trades like machinist, multicraft machinery maintenance, and millwright.7. Welding is a male dominated occupation. Traditionalist men will find it offers some insulation and respite from the typical feminist diatribe and PC bullshit of todays corporate world.Conclusion How has welding benefited me First, I developed reasoning skills, something that academia failed to do. I also developed a thorough understanding of how men do the dirty, nasty, and dangerous jobs in this life. Feminists and elitists can marginalize men all they want, but men risk their lives and health to build and maintain their shit.Further, welding has opened some doors for me, mainly teaching. My ultimate goal is to teach welding fulltime, a late life career change if you will, and one I hope will happen.Read More Is A Blue Collar Job for You ",hate
"  The Importance Of Patriarchal Religion To Marriage And Childrearing The Importance Of Patriarchal Religion To Marriage And Childrearing Brutus Centinel Brutus Centinel is an American Christian patriarch, leading a family resistance to the decline. Because guns are libertys teeth, Brutus is a firearms enthusiast, and a militia officer. Brutus fights to help Americans across the political spectrum wake up to the tyranny of our corporate overloads. November 4, 2016 Religion I live in America, and I am happily married, with kids. I do not write this because I am more manly, or intelligent, or successful than you I am not. I write this to share the main key to my success patriarchal, traditional religion. I am writing from my own religious convictions, which I believe are true. You are free to disagree, but you may still find value here. I have read the writings of other religions, and consider them True Myths, useful for their wisdom, even though I may disagree with their theology. Neomasculinity itself is a philosophy that can be accepted by people of different religions, or no religion. Modern Religion Ill find another church, thanks Modern religion is a feminized wasteland. God exists to impose obligations on men, and excuses womens evil acts. Faith is blind, irrational, and collectivist. Men hate modern religion, which is why most churches in the West are demographically imbalanced toward women. Men are bored to death with touchyfeely sermons, endless committee meetings, female gossip, and the losers sitting in the pews around them. This is not how it should be. Patriarchal Religion Thats more like it. Patriarchal religion is interesting to men. It teaches that God is a man, creator of rationality, slayer of evil men, protector of the innocent Praise be to the Lord my Rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle. Psalm 1441 In maleled churches, women are taught to be respectful to their fathers, husbands, and legitimate authority. They understand that their role is to raise and care for children, and support their husbands mission Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. Ephesians 522 In patriarchal religion, female sins, like rebellion, envy, dishonesty, hypergamy, dressing and acting like a whore, and hamstering or rationalizing sin are condemned When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. Genesis 36 I also want the women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, adorning themselves, not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God. 1 Timothy 2910 And Adam was not the one deceived it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner. 1 Timothy 214 This is the way of an adulterous woman She eats and wipes her mouth and says, Ive done nothing wrong. Proverbs 3020 Finding A Virtuous Woman This is the unicorn I married. All women are tempted towards sins like envy, but not all women act on their impulses. In spite of what many observe in the West, I have met many virtuous women few sexual partners before marriage, respectful, submissive to their husbands, physically fit, feminine, good mothers. Most are in the older generations, especially before the Boomers. Most are involved in traditional religion. There are fewer younger women who are virtuous, and every single one that I have met is involved in traditional religion. They tend to be more rural, from small churches. Traditional religion can be extremely helpful to finding and vetting women. It provides a community with certain values that you want in a woman, and it provides reliable references for a persons character. A woman who spent her younger years out in the world and came back at 29 be a bornagainvirgin is a red flag, but a woman in her early 20s who teaches Sunday School and helps with the potluck dinners is far more likely to be wife material. The older women in the church will usually let you know if a woman is a whore. Patriarchal Religion Helps Control Womens Sinful Tendencies With proper training, woman can be virtuous. Traditional religion acts as a curb but not a cure for womens immoral, rebellious, destructive behavior. My wife goes to a womens bible study group, where she often receives instruction from older religious women. This includes things like telling her to be submissive to me, lose weight and be healthy, not waste money, have cheerful sex on a regular basis, and to learn how to get some control over her emotions Teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good. Then they can urge the younger women to love their husbands and children, to be selfcontrolled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands. Titus 23 One of my wifes friends once corrected her attitude toward sex, saying you need to view your body as a sheath for your husbands sword. She now routinely thanks me after we have sex. I am not a natural alpha, but I have little fear that my wife is going to suddenly cut off sex if I have a minor slip up. Band Of Brothers Weve got your back, bro Deus Vult With this great power comes great responsibility. As a patriarch, I am commanded to lead my family, instructing my wife and kids on how to act properly, with genuine love for their wellbeing. I must be on top of my game, be physically fit, and think rationally when my wife is irrational. I attend a mens Bible study, where we talk about leading as men. Every man in my group owns a gun, and we often go shooting together. We encourage, support, teach, and correct each other. I have had sharp, intense, discussions with my pastor and men in my church about my own character and life decisions. Things are handled like men, discussed in the open, with realtalk not rhetorical bullshit, and masculine love and concern for each other. This has aided me in thinking deeply about my life, and correcting bad decisions I have made. Awhile back we helped another man who was on the verge of divorce. He was working 100 hours a week because he would not stand up to his employer, and had no energy to lead his family. We told him that the marriage counseling he was getting was bullshit talk about your feelings more, and that his slavish attitude toward his employer was making his wife lose respect for him. The women in our church also talked to his wife about choosing to be respectful and submissive, in spite of her rebellious emotions. He cut back hours at work, which enabled him able to be captain of his ship again. This, along with training his wife received, helped her become more respectful. Now, his wife is less of a bitch, and they have sex several times a week. I doubt this would have happened without patriarchal religion. Children Ive succeeded as a father We see that our culture is toxic, feminized, and immoral. Men need a place to raise children apart from these toxins, and church is a great place to do this. My kids go to Sunday School classes where they are taught to be respectful to me, my wife, and legitimate adult authorities. We have several families with welldisciplined children that we can trust wont corrupt our kids. My wife often takes the kids for playdates so she can socialize with wholesome women, which is a great alternative to sitting around on social media all day. Conclusion Patriarchal, traditional religion will not change female nature, but it can help restrain it. This is how past generations maintained civilization. I can confidently say that traditional religion is the main reason I can maintain a happy marriage in this cesspool of a culture. Those who are not religious might consider other institutions that may provide similar support for their marriage and childraising.",hate
"Home This Month Popular Is Western Civilization Worth Saving Is Western Civilization Worth Saving Beau Albrecht My father was a highranking student radical poobah and still thinks Castro is the bees knees. Although this makes me technically a red diaper baby, I rejected all that baloney early on. These days, I write stories  mostly comedy science fiction  as well as maintain a blog mainly about dating advice, political commentary, and my writing projects. November 4, 2016 Politics By 2050, its predicted the USA will no longer have a white majority, which in 1960 was 90. For this, we can thank Ted Kennedys Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which the politicians swore up and down wouldnt change the American ethnic composition. In Europe, due to declining native birth rates and mass immigration , this will eventually come to pass for several other nations later this century, all according to the CoudenhoveKalergi Plan . The leftists, with their really big hearts , think all this will be wonderful. Globalism and cultural Marxism are the driving forces behind population replacement policies, but unawareness and apathy are almost as much of a problem . Some think that if Western civilization will go down the toilet, they should just go with the flow and enjoy the ride all the way down the tubes. Thanks to media propaganda and educational indoctrination, they have no idea that their own civilization is worth anything, and dont have the slightest concern for their own posterity. Still, theyre pretty naive to believe that things cant turn far worse within their own lifetimes. Why this is bad for those who need reminding In the future, is this going to get better, or worse If trends continue unabated, the founding peoples will lose control over their destiny. History shows that when this happens, the results are not good. Pillaging and plundering is a more genteel affair in modern times though not always  but youre still not going to like it. Will your new rulers say, Since things have changed so much, how about we abolish Affirmative Action and setasides to show weve transcended race Dont count on it. More likely, theyll double down on these preferential treatment programs, and come up with new ones, and you will have no chance to block the spoils systems. Thats just the beginning, too. The  diversification  of cities for the last several decades has been badDetroit, need I say moreand riots really are getting out of hand. Now imagine what it will be like when you have no hope of influencing things like Section 8 housing moving into your neighborhood, or if youll get any real police protection. This is what were facing if the Aztln crowd takes over the Southwest, the community agitators get in charge of the big cities, and together their constituency has an electoral majority controlling the Federal government. Also remember that theyve been told since the 1960s that youre evil oppressors responsible for all their problems. Parts of flyover country might be able to hold out for a while, but nothing short of forming their own country will stop the advance of progress. If it were ever to come to secession, theyll be surrounded, outnumbered, and outgunned. Lets keep things from getting to that point. Is there any hope Refugees have taken on the characteristics of invaders Ive painted a grim picture, but I have to be realistic. As for what will happen later, things only look worse Jean Raspails Camp Of The Saints describes a bleak future like that. This isnt just the USA on the line, but Western Europe too, and perhaps Eastern Europe and Australia in time. If we want to keep from disappearing into the endless night, the time to act is now. Sometimes, with luck, sovereignty can be regained for example, the Spanish Reconquista, or the nations of the Balkans rising after a few centuries under the Turkish yoke. However, the results arent guaranteed some nations may never recover. In these examples, the dhimmis were subjugated under military occupation, but they were not outnumbered in their own lands. The founding populations must not allow themselves to be dispossessed in their own countries in the first place. Granted, the dark forces of globalism are very powerfuland theyd like us to think theyre invinciblebut they must be stopped. They also want you to think theyre smarter than you and know whats good for you . If theyd simply focus on getting richer, and cease their social engineering, theyd have far less to answer for. Not only has our political establishment failed us, theyre working against the public . It wont be easy, but we must reassert control over our destiny. Do we deserve to be dispossessed Brainwashed SJWs welcoming their own destruction Some will even sayoften with haughty condescensionthat if we lose our countries, then we deserve this fate. Ignoring for a moment the sheer snottiness, as well as the might makes right argument incongruent with the usual rhetoric of fairness by the prepare to be assimilated, resistance is futile crowd, lets consider the following facts In the 1920s, a Communist propaganda campaign was launched in the Western world. In the 1930s, this mutated into cultural Marxism and kicked into high gear during the 1960s. Most people have no idea of the scope of it all, or where things like political correctness came from. Only senior citizens remember what it was like living in a fairly normal country. Even fewer never grew up exposed to this propaganda in one form or another. The rest of us have been indoctrinated from an early age by the mass media and educational establishment. The Western political tradition lately is about openness and democracy. For this reason, we dont conduct political change by torches and pitchforks these days. We play fair, even if our enemies often dont . Further, political correctness encourages the disadvantaged to have solidarity, but vilifies the same in the majority. This is one reason why were on the defensive, and for now usually losing. Most people only have a vague idea about the extent of managed democracy and sheer corruption. Those against population replacement policies mostly put their faith in the mainstream opposition parties, not realizing that theyve sold out to deeppockets globalists too. Mainstream conservatism is a controlled opposition , providing token resistance at best. So with that extent of treachery, disinformation, limited options for resistance, and managed democracy, its grotesquely dishonest for the defeatists to tell us that were losing a fair fight As for their opinion that we should just give up, I have one word No. Whenever you hear the defeatists crowing that this is inevitable or that we deserve it, remember that they want to demoralize you and anyone else listening. The same goes for when they tell you that loving your people and wanting your posterity to survive is hatred. Suppose someone is losing his home by a devious swindle, orchestrated by crooks widely lauded for their fairness, caring, and honesty. It would be the height of arrogance to tell the defrauded that he deserved it and should shut up about it and let it happen. The depopulation and population replacement agenda First, the EU has to accept at least a million asylumseekers annually for the foreseeable future The EU should provide 15,000 euros 16,800 per asylumseeker for each of the first two years to help cover housing, healthcare and education costsand to make accepting refugees more appealing to member states. Dont be fooled this isnt happening because some vague, invisible force called progress is pushing things inevitably in this direction. No, its being actively promoted by globalist interests that have adopted cultural Marxism as a means of control. Why are native fertility rates declining below replacement level The major factors are Women are encouraged to spend their 20s partying and their 30s trying to get rich in a cube farm. Encouraging them to to make starting a family last priority often leaves them very unhappy over the long term, and many will miss the chance to begin. Good economy tends to be positively correlated with higher fertility rates. During recessions, births go down. The implications are obvious. If less tax money was taken from working citizens for costly social services programs and spitinyoureye wars, then theyd be able to afford more children. Sending the guilty to prison instead of bailing them out when they crash the economy might be a good indirect measure too. About a third of American babies conceived end up aborted . Thanks, feminism The same leftists who think this is wonderful will scream bloody murder whenever a savage killer on Death Row is executed, but all thats another matter. Because of declining fertility rates, the globalists tell us that we must open the floodgates of Third World immigration to prop up the population and support the aging citizens. So theyve fed us poison, and to soothe the symptoms, they want to feed us another kind of poison. To hell with that Granted, keeping Social Security going in the USA will be a challenge. Still, its pretty uncertain that newlyarriving immigrantsif they become the majoritywill be able or willing to support millions of elderly gringos. As for future European retirees, will they be well cared for by refugees from Africa and the Middle East The way things are now, many of them prefer rioting , looting, and collecting welfare over working. So these are going to be the people propping up the European retirement programs Dispossession is inevitable only if we let it happen. For now, we must educate the rest of the public about whats going on, and convince them that their future is worth saving and their posterity is worth preserving. Once weve achieved critical mass, we can confront the political establishment and get the government to start working for us rather than against us Whats in it for us Whenever someone writes that Western civilization is nothing but injustice and oppression, theyre using technology we invented to complain about us. Its fashionableespecially in academiato bash Western civilization. Were not perfect, but nobody else is either. The truth is that were a creative, dynamic, and industrious people. Some of us are under the impression that we dont have any culture only other people do but thats mistaken. I could spend all day listing our major artists, composers, poets, philosophers, writers, theologians, and the like, but I only would scratch the surface. Other cultures have made notable contributionsparticularly East Asia and the Middle Eastbut the fact is that the majority of science and technology that makes life comfortable today originated in the Western world. Electricity, motorized transportation, refrigeration, telecommunications, computers need I go on Yep, that was us. We shared our medical advances with the rest of the world, increasing longevity and quality of life around the globe. Whether the worlds future looks more like Star Trek or more like Blade Runner may have a lot to do with whether or not our people survive. Finally, most of us are going to live out our lives in our native countries. Do we want them to stay the same nations we grew up in Some time in the future, todays youth will be running the show while were elderly. What kind of a place do we want it to be by then Western civilization is great lets keep it going.",hate
"As the election is inching slowly towards its end, experts are nervously scrambling to find any dirt that would stop the Trump train.First, Megyn Kelly pulled the sexist card, then it was his undisclosed tax returns, then his comments on John McCain, then making fun of crippled reporters, then his reading of Mein Kampf, then his remarks about dating his daughter.Then accusations of racism from former employees, his usage of eminent domain, hiring of immigrants and other questionable practices, the Trump University scandal, his blunder on abortion, old comments on drug decriminalization and gun control, his relationship with the Clintons and the DC insiders, his comments on refugees and illegal immigrants, the Khan incident. And, of course, the pussygrabbing scandal.Surely this time, it will sink his campaign, wont it  And yet each time Teflon Don deflects dirt more dexterously than ghetto trash trying escape alimony payments. Nothing seems to be able to stop him, not that his opponents will ever stop trying.Trump has the fantastic ability to escape unharmed from what would clearly destroy any career politician. Howard Deans Yeehaw was enough to end his bid for the Democratic candidate in 2004, and yet Trump can call for an end to Muslim refugees, be accused of grabbing women by their loins, and end up being praised for it by the masses, while the mainstream media spew their bile 24/7.What has allowed Trump to maneuver so nimbly against these accusations is the unprecedented role of internet media in elections, including being able to reach people directly through Twitter and a lack of trust in traditional media, as well as his biggerthanlife persona letting him get away with what others would be lynched for.But thats the story for another article. I would rather talk about something else. Particularly, is there anything that could stop him The answer will surprise you as it goes against all conventional wisdom.Yes, but its not what you think.Trumps weak spot One of the biggest problems with defeating Trump is that unlike other politicians, political scandals not only seem to not affect him, but they even aid him. There is a saying that every antiTrump meme is also a proTrump meme.Trump has mastered political antifragility, which causes him to only strengthen when opponents try to destroy him. Trump has defeated the lefts no platform for fascists mentality by saying things so outrageous they have no option but to report on him.So, the left cannot choose to not cover him and let him wallow in obscurity like they did with Ron Paul. Neither can they attack him, for each of their attacks only make him more popular.One memorable movie quote I remember went something like this Every man has a weak spot. First you try to buy him with money, then women, then you go for his family, and if that doesnt work, well, a bullet always does the job. Unfortunately, unlike other political losers, Don does not need other peoples money, nor does he lack female attention, and his family is smart and probably safe from violence.But this isnt an article about God forbid Donald Trump getting assassinated. That would stop Trump, but not the Trump train. Trump is more than a man. Trump is an idea. He is the avatar of discontent of all those opposed to progressive ideology. He would become a martyr, thus raising the hatred for his opponents to a fever pitch which might alter Americas consciousness forever. Trumps enemies cant afford that.So if ignoring Trump does not work, throwing dirt at him does not work, bribing him doesnt work and even killing him wont work, than what is left The answer might surprise you.You see Trumps power comes from his contrarianism. He is not a candidate, he is an anticandidate. People dont just vote FOR Trump they vote AGAINST Hillary, Obama, Progressives and Cuckservatives. He is the wrecking ball who the injured working class and all nonliberal whites as well as minorities not completely in love in with progressive Marxist ideology want to use against the establishment.So what can be done to stop him  Well, lets ask ourselves what makes Trump popular  His brashness, his antiPC attitudes, his antielitism, his not being a part of the Establishment hacks, his being not one of them, his being different.So if that is what gives Trump strength, it would make sense that to weaken him, you would have to present him as the opposite of that. To present him as being nothing special, to make him look boring and weak. To present him as just another PCdrone.Theyve claimed nonstop that Trump is the next Hitler and that he will start building concentration camps and sexually assaulting random women by grabbing their cock pockets and will obliterate Muslims and minorities with Right WiNg Death Squad robots.Instead they could have claimed that he is just weakling trying to act tough, and that he wont deliver anything. That he is in love with political correctness and respects women. That he is a progressives best choice. That he will bring four more years of Obama.That of course would present its own difficulties. In the age of online media, the monopoly of physical press has been broken. When news circulates at the speed of minutes rather than hours and days, it would be very hard for the establishment media to accomplish this. It is very hard to call Trump ordinary and boring when his statements break so many taboos.Yet, as difficult as it may have been, at the very least it would have had a chance of success, as small as it was. Calling him sexist, racist, and other mean words did nothing to stop him, and instead only made him more popular with the masses. Some of these incidents have made Donald seem human and it made people trust him more. Showing his flaws had the opposite effect as intended, as those who hated him already needed no extra ammo, but those who liked him were either left indifferent, or whats worse excited by his statements.At worst a few moderates had doubts set in their mind, however considering what short attention span undecided voters have, his stellar performance at the second debate clearly made them forget about the statement and maybe even convinced them to focus on Bills sexual misdeeds instead.Why havent his opponents used this against him This brings us to the final point of this article. Why havent his opponents used this against him Have they not the brains to figure this out Hard to believe, considering the amount of money being poured into think tanks.No, the truth is like that the strategy was forsaken because of the sideeffects it would have on their own camp. Should his opponents try to attack him as another PC drone, they would be also attacking themselves. Just like Hillary trying to paint Trump as sex offender only made it easier for Trump to point at Bills sexual indiscretions. As it has been said in the mighty book of Kek  thee that dwell in glass lodgings shall not propel sedimentary formations The Prophecy of Kek, Chapter 4  Verse 20. Attacking Trump for being multicultural, politically correct, weak, inefficient, or a shill would only shed light on the establishments own weakness.This means that in order to draw voters away from Trump they would have to claim Trump loves multiculturalism, antiracism, open borders, free trade, globalism and offer another candidate who would be even more extreme than him on these crucial issues.Using this strategy against Trump, even if it was successful, would be a Pyrrhic victory for his opponents, as cuckservatives would have to acknowledge they cant woo supporters with talks about reducing taxes and bringing back Reaganism. The truth is, the future is bleak for ReaganBushCuck wing of the GOP. Even if they were to win the election, they would lose the war.The left has won the cultural war not just by winning elections, but by cultural metawarfare. Instead of moderating their message in attempt to win election, they used popular culture and mass media to push liberal values to the masses, and so the right wing had no option, but do concessions, dropping people who opposed civil rights, womens liberation and closed borders.To put it simply, the battle was lost even before Trump cameTrump was the match that ignited the powder keg. He simply mobilized people, and said what others kept in private, but always wanted to say and now there is no turning back.The elites cannot choose to ignore popular will and still win elections anymore. They will have to reform the GOP to account for their constituencys desire or risk ending in the dust bin of history. There is no longer the option to charm the sheeple with talks about low taxes, open borders and the awfulness of bigotry. They will have to, at least, nominally give something back to the people to stay in power.As one wise commenter on this site once said  Trump may be a liar like the rest of them, but at least he is saying the right lies.The next thing people on the manosphere and the altright will have to look after will be Trumplike figures who will copy Trumps rhetoric, but will fail to deliver any solutions. Or they will try to coopt and redirect that anger.

"Cuckservatism is a topic that has previously been discussed in detail on Return Of Kings , in articles and comments sections alike. The underlying reason that this topic is the focus of a great deal of discussion is because its roots are deeply steeped in both cowardice and betrayal.While our readership is well acquainted with the political and social implications of cuckservatism, there is also a need to also discuss its behavioral roots. To accomplish this task, I used my social media accounts to examine connections of mine who displayed all of the classic red flags associated with cuckservatism. I then searched for common traits that they possessed based on the nature of their rants or posts.The three characteristics listed below represent key factors which, in my opinion, are necessary for any individual to transform from an otherwise normal person into a cuck. If we can understand these factors, this will enable us to develop a more comprehensive strategy for rendering them irrelevant, apart from merely ignoring them.Political Naivet Nothing screams political naivety more than voting for a last minute candidate who considers himself a conservative alternative to Trump.This factor represents the first step that one must take to become a cuckservative, because it entails believing in a series of premises that are patently false. Political naivet can include simpler forms, such as believing in the wage gap or that illegal immigrants are natural republicans. Conversely, political naivet can also be more complex, in that an individual afflicted with it might believe in equality as a virtue or that a democratic two party system is the best form of government. A perfect example of this can be seen in my friends and associates who blindly believe in the Constitution. These individuals refuse to vote for anyone other than a constitutionalist, and their sole metric for judging candidates is the implications of an obscure constitutional issue that only they care about. This perspective is indicative of political naive because the globalists who run our political system jettisoned any belief in the Constitution and rule of law decades ago. For them, the Constitution is merely a convenient rubber stamp used to justify unpopular political decisions. Accordingly, anyone who votes ONLY for candidates with such narrow viewpoints is naively playing into the hands of globalists because they fail to understand that the Constitution will only function in a nation thats virtuous and willing to abide by its principles. If the United States continues on its current demographic track, we will eventually import a new population that not only despises original American values, but would also actively vote to eliminate them. The Constitution will provide no protections if this occurs, because these people will simply ignore it, invoking arguably the most important phrase in all of American legal history . To fail to understand these stakes when considering ones voting patterns, instead opting to emulate the local revolutionary war reenactors, is a hallmark trait of a cuckservative. Lack Of Self Confidence A Cuckservative would never get this far.Lack of selfconfidence, and the feelings of doubt that serve as its foundation, represents a second symptom of cuckservatism, which is why Return Of Kings has countless articles on how to acquire and maintain selfconfidence as a form of preventative medicine. Doubts as to ones chances of success, coupled with fear and the innate need for selfpreservation, can easily shatter most people. In such moments of weakness, its very easy for a person to do a 180 and to do something that they would normally find revolting. Conversely, if one steadfastly believes in their convictions and themselves, their selfconfidence will become stronger. This is true even in situations when seemingly the entire world is against them. The following clip is from an interview that Jeb Bush did with Lester Holt during the Republican Primary, and is an excellent illustration of how a lack of selfconfidence can lead to powerlessness and a lack of control over ones surroundings. From the very beginning of this clip, Jebs lack of self confidence is readily apparent. Whether it was the fact that he was too far hunched over in his seat, his attempts to curb his nervousness by forcing himself to smile or laugh, or the fact that he rarely made eye contact with Lester Holt, any ability that he has to project himself was undermined by his body language.An even deeper sign of his lack of selfconfidence begins at 045 in the video, when Holt proceeds to ask him why he didnt frame the Charleston shooting as an act of racism. In this situation, if asked such a question in any setting, an individual has one of two choices. If he is selfconfident, he would turn the question back on Lester Holt by saying that racism is a social construct and the only people who care about it are limpwristed losers.However, if one is like Jeb and lacks selfconfidence, their response to this situation will be to immediately try to compromise by acknowledging the premise raised by someone like Lester Holt and then spend the rest of the interview trying to show that theyre not a bad person. This was the approach that Jeb used, and it demonstrated to Lester Holt that he was weak, which then led to Lester forcing Jeb to backtrack and question his own decision to support Stand Your Ground laws during his tenure as Floridas governor.A lack of selfconfidence, as evidenced by Jebs failure to retain control over his surroundings during his interview with Lester Holt, highlights a classic character trait shared by cuckservatives. The only answer that I can come up with, as to why this trait is so prevalent, is that it might be a product of their childhood that they havent been able to get over.In a way, the archetypal cuck was likely bullied or mistreated as a child, but has never learned how to fight back or to love being hated by others. Because of this, they never developed the necessary level of selfconfidence to succeed in life, which eventually translates over to their politics.They Want To Be Friends With Everyone How to destroy a political movement established by ones father in one fell swoop.Having grown up in the leftist Northeast, and considering that I still live and work there, Im used to being in the political minority. My coping mechanisms for this situation consisted of unknowingly embracing key tenets of the Alternative Right, and knowing how to pick my political fights. Additionally, I also resolved to never be friendly with or ever trust anyone from the political left, a decision that has been vindicated over the last several years. Unfortunately, my approach is not a popular one amongst political dissidents in my region. This is because many of them, having grown up with leftists, simply view their political disagreements as a series of gentlemanly differences that they can put aside over a few beers. They refuse to believe that leftists and SJWs hate anyone who even slightly disagrees with them and, like women, view weak men as easy targets. Accordingly, when faced with the choice of staying true to their beliefs or moderating them in order to ensure that they get invited to the next sushi night, art showing or paint nite the cuckservatives that I know will roll over every time. Specifically, theyll profess support for third party libertarian or constitutional candidates, while supporting a slightly lessliberal version of their leftist friends politics. This tendency demonstrates a key principle that most cuckservatives subconsciously hold they want to be liked by everyone, and will therefore do anything they can to make this happen, even if it means betraying themselves and their own beliefs in the process. When does adopting this attitude ever lead to success in life If a child keeps getting beat up by a schoolyard bully, should they cower in the bullys presence and act as his lackey in order to avoid getting hurt We all know that such an approach is worthless and that the only way to respond is to fight back, yet these people adopt the same approach when dealing with the political equivalent of a schoolyard bully. Perhaps their reason for trying to be friends with globalists and trying to appease them by being moderate stems from the way in which they handled problems in childhood, however that issue itself is another topic that deserves discussion by itself. Is There A Remedy For These Character Flaws Even if we understand these characteristics, and can think of active ways to subvert cuckservatism, we will not be entirely successful. Most people who fall under this category have been psychologically conditioned to act this way, meaning that much of our attempts to open their eyes will fall on deaf ears. I have no sympathy for these people because theyve never had the internal drive or fortitude necessary to overcome adversity, and would rather wallow in misery while also pulling others into the abyss with them. However, there are always a couple that might show potential. These individuals might only be seen by us as cuckservatives because they imitated others around them, while lacking a positive role model that could show them the truth. The greatest service we can do for these select few is to identify them and prove that there is a viable alternative .If 25 cents a day can supposedly help a starving African family have rice for six months, then us acting as positive role models to our weaker brethren will help them immeasurably while also advancing our own cause.Read More David Frenchs Candidacy For President Shows That Cuckservatives Cant Stop Donald Trump ",hate

"  American Woman In Bikini Desecrates French Catacombs For Her Female Indiana Jones Brand American Woman In Bikini Desecrates French Catacombs For Her Female Indiana Jones Brand Andr is a young European who left his decaying country in 2012 for greener pastures. He enjoys exploring subterranean places, reading about a host of interconnected topics, and yearns for Tradition. November 5, 2016 Girls The Paris catacombs are a place dear to my heart. Born in this very city, I had a front row seat to see it turn into a giant museum. Every wealthy asshole wanting his own piece of the city of lights, and Paris being one of the most visited cities in the world , I could see year after year the streets taken over by luxury clothing shops and expensive venues. The middle and lower classes have been pushed aside by rising living costs so that the rich globalists, the bobos and a neverending trail of tourists could stroll around. Yet, go twenty meters below the Haussmanian hurdle, and you will find something very different. South of the Seine, the lands have been deeply dug to extract building stones. Most of the voids have been filled since, but more than a hundred kilometres of mine galleries are still there. Exploring the place is officially forbidden. Which is a good thing, as one can go there officiously, provided one knows how to enter and not get lost in the labyrinth, without bothering with swarms of tourists or wasting money in an overpriced bar. Officially prohibited, actually more or less selfmanaged by a loose community of cataphiles , the Catacombs are one of the most interesting places today in Paris. It allows for genuine explorations and friendly meetings while also teaching some masculine virtues to those who venture there seriously. The underground network being fragile and the officials not enjoying when too many visitors tread on their jurisdiction, the cataphiles have a complex relationship with exposing it. On the one hand, we like to show the place and share its atmosphere with passionate newcomers on the other, we are afraid that too much exposition will attract too many visitors and stifle the officials relative toleration for unofficial activities. Well, today, other cataphiles wont chastise me for mentioning the topic in public, for this has been already made recently by an attention whore of international scope. Alison Teal, a Hawaiian 28 or 29 years old girl, made a show of herself down there and sent ludicrous photos to the Daily Mail . So, Im here to teach you about protecting the planet, yknow I love bringing surfboards in places without waves. By the way, Im the feminine Indiana Jones, especially with the help of a crew Ill never give credit to. Follow me on Instagram and YT Here we are not talking about attention whoring lightly. The Daily Mail photos already tell much a blond girl in a pink bikini carries a pink surfboard in a narrow underground network where there is, by definition, no waves to surf at all, to take some photos of herself, herself, herself, and a bit of the catacombs, as they could be used as the setting of the latest of Alisons Adventures. Im not joking. These adventures are literally Hitler a trademark. Since she was at least 18, Teal seems to have taken advantage from the nomadic lifestyle of her parents to make photos, movies, and promote herself heavily along the way. With the help of her dad, a wellconnected photographer and selfpromoter who claims to master yoga, she got a bunch of awards and media promotion. Longhaired Alison was thus handed a niche that allows her to travel the world, take pictures of herself in various places, and claim to be concerned about the environment. Her rsum shows a massive ego associated to minor lies. The world was my school and playgroundI guess smaller places would be too small for her giant ego, and this may explain why she suffered from claustrophobia under Paris, as we are to see below. Between namedroppings, references to media awards and other big pictures of Alison, Teal, and Alison Teal, we learn she was styled the Female Indiana Jones by Time Magazine 2015 and the Oprah of Adventure by The Huffington Post 2016. Really Actually, Teal said to the HuffPo she aspired to be the Oprah of adventure in 2014 before branding herself as the female Indiana Jones to the Time a year later 2015, not 2016. Then she said on Twitter and on her rsum how they had referred to her as such. Not a big lie, but a lie indeed. By the way, she also branded herself a Tarzan child in the HuffPo interview. Would someone who really grew up in the wild be so obsessed with linking herself to famous icons Excerpt from the HuffPo article, 05/20/2014. The same articles adds she is a selfdescribed Tarzan child. Excerpt from the Time article, 11/08/2015. Named by Time Magazine or selfstyled And now on her rsum. Not only does she lie by misattributing to famous media outlets selfcharacterizing and lavishly flattering labels, but she cant even put the right years while referring to said media pieces. So, selfstyled female Indiana Jones, no less, went through what seems to be a joint undertaking with the Daily Mail by descending into the Paris catacombs with the symbols of her Adventures, namely a pink bikini and a surfboard. The English tabloid released the photos, video, and testimony of IndianaJonesInABikiniSurfingTheCatacombs the 30 th of October. Days after, a bunch of French outlets copied the Mail content, often translating it verbatim . What struck me first are the stunning inaccuracies the tabloid published. First, the Mail claims Teal went 150 meters below the ground, whereas the actual depth of the Catacombs goes between 10 and 30 meters depending on where you are in the network. Cant Indiana Jane tell the difference between 30 and 150 meters Second, she also claimed to have lacked oxygen and witnessed the water level suddenly rising. This is at best extremely unlikely. The water levels can change from month to month and even from week to week, but to my knowledge it never changes abruptly in seconds. As for the oxygen issue, I have witnessed some only two times at a big party, when so many people were in the same room that there was not enough oxygen to light a cigarette, and from claustrophobic newcomers who could not stand the place. Either she completely made up the sudden water change and oxygen issues in order to give her story a sensational aspect, or, more likely, got a panic attack due to claustrophobia, but preferred to twist it into a grandiose plot rather than acknowledging her own limitations. The Mail just ate that up and published without question. They did not ask any actual cataphile for sure. Had they done so, anyone with a decent experience of the catacombes could have told them what I just wrote above. I also noticed from her quotes that she does not mention anyone from her crew, gives no credit to the men who opened the manhole cover, helped her go down the humid ladder, showed her the way, filmed her She would never have found the entrance if no one already in the know had accepted to be her guide. Neither could she lift manhole covers of more than a hundred kilograms with her thin armseven the round butt she likes to display couldnt do that. The first photo displayed by the Mail. Notice how she strategically displays some of her butt. I could bet she did not have sex with any of the guys who enabled her display to happen. As Julius Evola hinted, she is likely the kind of woman to whom the possibilities of physical love are often not as interesting as the narcissistic cult of her body, or as being seen with as many or as few clothes as possible Evola, Revolt Against the Modern World , chap.20. In this respect, the only thing that makes Teal special compared to all other lookatme twats is the adventurous label she tries to put on herself. Exploiting people and places to garner attention is definitely not special. Yet, a lot of comments have noticed this behind the weird mix of glamour and pseudoadventure some are offended that she treaded on bones, i.e. remnants of real past men, in a pink bikini. Doing so is not only a proof of bad taste and selfaggrandizing maniait is also utterly disrespectful. This is indeed a blatant example of pussy pass . Imagine going to Hawaii, bringing a skateboard at a local cemetery and start skateboarding over the graves in a pink throng. What do you expect would happen You would probably get beaten by locals, and if the media gave you attention at all, they would label you as a disturbed troll or something like that. All this, I think, would be fair. But when a selfimportant Oprah Jane of superadventure does the same, the mainstream media reacts completely differently and celebrates her without the least hint of criticism. Though she treading and surfing on bones of actual past people is not very respectful for sure, I think especially appalling the outlook Teal seems to carry on the place. The Catacombs are just another background for Alison Adventures. Whole places, some loaded with historical and spiritual significance, are reduced to a set for the egotic show of another vapid character. The entire world was her school, or so she said, meaning that the world is turned into a mixture of Disneyland and Hollywood studio where her picture can stroll around. Some weeks ago, Alison Teal was busy showing herself near an erupting volcano. Notice another strategic partdisplay of her butt. Usual newcomers to the Catacombs come there with a genuine interest in the place. They come to find out, sometimes drink, and have an actual adventure. They cannot help but feel some humility, perhaps even awe, when meeting with the bones of millions of nameless dead, most if not all of them having lived before the nineteenth century, and having been carried there so that Paris could grow. This is very different from using the place to play adventure, treading on bones in a rather inappropriate outfit, depending on a crew of real cataphiles but forgetting to give them the slightest credit, and showing utter carelessness to the historical and spiritual significance of the place, all so that Alisons Ego Adventures Show continues. As you can see above, a lot of the comments are negativeespecially those from cataphiles and Teal has discreetly withdrawn the video of her trail from YouTube, putting it into private mode. Teals circus has at least one merit it symbolizes pretty well one of the worst aspects of the Westernization of the world. In the West, there is no wilderness, no sacredness, no magic. There are tons of potential places for tourism, but ultimately, all these places are losing their soul and turning into Disneylands. The Catacombs are worth it because they are definitely not so, and should never be. Fortunately, there can be some immanent justice. The wave of criticism under Teals disrespectful show is well deserved. More harshly, a young libtard who thought she could hitchhike through Middle East to prove Muslims peaceful got raped and killed by the peaceful ones she theatrically claimed to care about. The event shew, or should have shown, that the world is not a giant kindergarten for Western strong and independent narcissists. In a world of selfmarketing and selfcentred cunts, everyone is too busy caring about ones image and about meaningless representations to truly care about a place or about family members. Truly respectable women are not the ones we spot the most easily, and true cataphiles are often discreet as well. Your humble servant bathed there before Teal pretended to surf the place, but I would definitely not exhibit myself treading on bones in a pink thong",hate
"  Donald Trump Rushed Off Stage In Reno After Possible Assassination Attempt Donald Trump Rushed Off Stage In Reno After Possible Assassination Attempt This account syndicates news from other media outlets. November 5, 2016 News Via Breitbart  Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was rushed offstage at a Reno, Nevada campaign rally as a protester in the audience was involved in an extended incident near the stage. It was not immediately clear what was occurring in the crowd, but several members of what appeared to be law enforcement or U.S. Secret Service jumped down into the area where the protester was, as could be seen on Right Side Broadcasting Networks video livestream of the event. Video of Trump being rushed off stage was posted online In the video it appears Trump pauses to look out into the crowd for the event disrupter. Two U.S. Secret Service agents can be seen rushing in to remove Trump from the stage and two other agents also facilitate his removal. During his absence someone announced to the crowd that Trump would return. The protester was eventually seen being removed from the crowd, although there appeared to be a struggle with several law enforcement or Secret Service agents to secure the protesters removal. It was several minutes before Trump was able to take the stage again. As Trump returned to the stage, he thanked the crowd, which cheered him back. Nobody said it was going to be easy for us, but we will never be stopped, never ever be stopped, said Trump. Here is the man in question, in handcuffs, being searched by officers after he was escorted out of the rally area. pic.twitter.com/pjoMCtM39K",hate
"A tenperson federal jury has found that Rolling Stone journalist Sabrina Rubin Erdely defamed University of Virginia dean Nicole Eramo with actual malice over a fraudulent college rape story. Rolling Stone and its parent company Wenner Media were also found to have defamed Eramo, who is seeking 7.5 million in damages, but to a lesser extent than the writer herself. Rubin Erdelys piece conveyed that Eramo was indifferent and even callous towards the accuser, Jackie Coakley , in addition to discouraging her from reporting the crime. And so continues coverage of the rape hoax of the decade.The controversy, which began with the publication of Rubin Erdelys story in 2014, centered on a now debunked fraternity gang rape alleged by fabulist Coakley . Well before this weeks court decision, Rubin Erdely admitted to not bothering to contact the male UVA students accused of the act. These young men, via their Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, are suing separately for 25 million , a surprisingly low figure which makes Eramos claim look comparatively astronomical.Sabrina Rubin Erdely, far left, arrives for court. Pictured on the right is the Deputy Managing Editor of Rolling Stone, Sean Woods, instrumental in the bogus storys publication and who defended it later.Because of Coakleys limited financial position, and the respect even outed sexual assault frauds are given, Eramo is legally pursuing only Rubin Erdely, Rolling Stone , and Wenner Media for the 7.5 million. Nevertheless, Eramos attempts to portray herself as a victim are troubling. She was, after all, UVAs goto college administrator for handling sexual violence cases, a euphemism for the organizer of what are basically kangaroo courts.Aside from Eramo, UVA President Teresa Sullivans actions were appalling. Giving basic credence to Jackies allegations, Sullivan suspended all Greek Life activities at the University of Virginia as publicity about the accusations grew. This only increased the suffering of the falsely maligned fraternity members, plus gave ammunition to the rape culture activists who ridiculously represent every young male on campus as a potential sexual abuser of women.The true victims are the falsely accused young men, not Nicole Eramo Nicole Eramo is a victim of the same system she helps to prop up and defend rape culture.Nicole Eramo may have been defamed, but she was also intricately involved in a UVA system that does not afford young men even the most basic procedural rights. Whilst we should be happy that she did not rush into supporting Jackie Coakleys lies to the extent of trying to eschew police involvement, we are still not dealing with either an admirable or upstanding individual.After extensive research, I am yet to find instances of Eramo challenging the shameful treatment of college students accused of sexual assault, whether in specific instances or more broadly. She is neither a defender of these young men nor some kind of principled whistleblower. The only positive thing that can be generally said of her is that she is somewhat less prone to typical kneejerk SJW reactions, i.e. she did try to get Jackie to talk to the police.Again, Jackie Coakley has escaped any punishment Stupid does not even begin to describe the man who decided to marry rape hoaxer Jackie Coakley. Thanks to Chuck Johnson and www.gotnews.com for their work in outing Coakley as a fabulist and sociopath.Jackie Coakley is the sociopathic architect of this whole mess. Notwithstanding that Rubin Erdely and others would have gleefully found another poster girl from somewhere else in America, the degree of malice and calculation in Coakleys actions is the worst I have seen. Even the very terrible Crystal Mangum , the black stripper who is now serving a long sentence for homicide not false rape allegations, made her bogus accusations of racism and being gang raped much more opportunistically, after Duke lacrosse players declined her services as a stripper. Coakleys misdeeds, however, inhabit a world of their own.Because women like Jackie Coakley, obsessed as they are with fantasy worlds and selfvictimization, have next to no money to go after in defamation suits, they need to be charged and prosecuted for crimes such as public mischief. It obviously would be better if they were charged with making a false rape claim, yet Coakley had enough selfpreserving foresight to avoid talking to the police. Consequently, the system usually gives next to no remedies for discouraging outright lies about rape. To boot, The Washington Post may have savaged Rubin Erdely and Rolling Stone , but it still refuses to publish Jackie Coakleys full name, despite all the evidence completely disproving the rape accusations.If Nicole Eramo gets 7.5 million, the accused male UVA students deserve 7.5 billion Attentionseeker Emily Renda. She used Jackie Coakleys lies to promote an agenda, not seek redress for a victim.Determination of damages in the Nicole Eramo case is yet to take place and the 7.5 million claim may just have been posturing by her legal team, a high watermark figure designed to secure a smaller but nonetheless very tidy sum. At a minimum, the accused UVA students deserve 100 times more than whatever Eramo gets. Of course, Wenner Medias coffers are nowhere near that big, but the principle remains. Compared to the mauled reputations of the witchhunted fraternity members, Eramo suffered a slight pinprick from a broken system she has otherwise staked her career on supporting and expanding.Other villains in this saga also need to be held to account. Chief among them is Emily Renda , a sociology major at UVA who is now completing a law degree at UC Berkeley. A rape culture extremist, she acted as the conduit between Coakley and Rubin Erdely. As Chuck Johnson and Got News have already demonstrated, Rendas own rape survivor story has changed . Biased journalists such as Anna Merlan , formerly of Jezebel , additionally promoted the UVA hoax and were greatly upset when the gang rape was found not to have taken place. So many supporting actors created this mess.Lets hope that the heavy legal blows against Rubin Erdely, Rolling Stone , and, obliquely, Jackie Coakleys lies continue with the UVA fraternity defamation suit. Only significant financial and legal hardship, not the pangs of conscience, will stop SJWs and their enablers from attempting to ruin the lives of innocent men.Read More Why Hasnt Jackie Coakley Been Punished For Starting The Biggest Rape Hoax Of The Decade ",hate
"Many older physical trainers, and even those younger ones who were proteges of the older men, will tell the trainee that there is an inverse correlation between strength and speedthat being too big and muscular will slow down an athlete for whatever reason, I have found that this is most prevalent amongst traditional martial artists. The usual reason given is that the increased mass is simply a dead weight, while those with a little bit more knowledge will explain that lifting will develop slow twitch muscles over the Fast twitch muscles needed for sprinting, jumping, punching, and kicking.I am here to tell you that the common wisdom is completely wrongwhen done properly, weightlifting will not impede your speed, and will in fact enhance your speed and explosivenessAnecdotes Perhaps youve heard of this manThat is of course Jamaicas Usain Bolt, the fastest man in the world, and holder of multiple Olympic records. Also worth noting is that in an interview, Mr. Bolt revealed that he squats 400 pounds, and at least partially attributes his nigh inhuman speed to his training regimen. And hes not the only speed athlete who this can be said oflook at any Olympic class sprinter, they are all quite muscular fellows.Similarly, other athletic disciplines thats athletics in the specific rather than general sense, Im using the European term for what my countrymen call track and field have claimed to utilize weightlifting in their training, such as the long jump and the hurdles. Or, you can take my word for it at my best I had a one rep max squat of 320 pounds, and had a 38 inch vertical leap I am judging this by my ability to perform a standing jump over 2ndhighest position hurdles, which are measured at 38 inches .In fact, many worldlevel athletes of all disciplines are utilizing Olympic style weightlifting to develop speed and powe r.Anyway you slice it, compound weight training is a fantastic supplement to all athletes, even those who seemingly dont need that raw brute strength.The Science As I elaborated in this article , as well as in the free PDF I offer to subscribers to my website the subscription signup is on the front page theres more than one type of way to be athletic. More accurately, there are three, speaking purely in terms of muscular and/or nervous system function, so this does not include handtoeye coordination or other skills related to team sports. These three things can, loosely, correlate to the three types of muscle fibersRedor slowOxidative, Fast Glycolyticor White, and Fast Oxidative. Rather than rehash an article that Ive already written, we will focus on the white muscle, the fast glycolytic. This is the type of muscle you want to be training for if you want to develop sprinting speed or a high vertical leap.Or, to put this into terms of Newtons second law of motion, AccelerationForce/Mass, ie the amount of muscular force you can exert, divided by your body weighthow fast you can accelerate. And yes, I am aware that theres probably a more mathematically accurate way of putting this.Which Exercises To Do It is at this point that youre probably asking which exercises you should train to develop those physical skills you desire. If you read my articles regularly, you will know what I am likely to saycompound free weight liftingIn fact, Ill go out on a limb and say if you dont know which exercise you should do to develop a certain physical trait, you should always default to a compound lift unless you receive some further information that says otherwise. Training for speed or vertical leap is no exception to this rule.If you are looking for sheer running speed and leaping ability, the power lifts that hit the lower body are most effective deep Ass to grass squats, deadlifts, and the clean and jerk are used by professional athletes to great effect.Similarly, if you want the ability to throw a ball or punch harder, upper body compound lifts are the key bench presses, overhead presses and, yes, the clean and jerk, will see you through.So for those of you who are afraid that your athletic performance will be somehow impeded by heavy weightlifting, nothing could be further from the truth.Read More Improve Your Weightlifting With A Video Camera ",hate

They hated men because, they said, men werent letting them copulate frantically like men had always wanted them to. Men, or more likely their mothers, didnt let them make themselves unattractive by dressing like hodcarriers and swearing like sailors. Finally men gave in and now women hate them for that .

Then the overriding need to extend Globalisms goals in the person of Hillary Clinton blot out every other priority. Then the major media twist whatever they need to twist. Then its the same bubble for everyone.Soon, just like the mainstream media on television and in print, everything you see online will be directed at making you think, behave and vote a certain way. The micromanagement and control of information just hasnt become that sophisticated  yet.Obama already hinted that only official information should be linked up by the corporate interests of Facebook, Google, etc. Look for Hillary to implement that idea with an iron fist if she is whisked into the Oval Office . An Internet security crisis will likely be engineered in the near future in whichyou guessed itBig Daddy Government needs to step in and take control of the web. From there on out we will be back to corporategovernment propaganda instead of the Libertarians dream the current iteration of the Internet is.So, the awakening we have seen from the brainwashing of the corporate media will be a temporary one if the elite have anything to do with it. The groundwork of this new, Socialist system of micromanaging information is already being laid. You already see it every time you do a search.Someday soon the only information well be able to find online will be from sources the corporategovernment complex approves of. Of course, there will be renegades and rebels like us who resist, but most of the braindead sheeple out there will go along to get along just as has been happening since time immemorial.Our options will be to get off the grid or to move to a new Internet. Neither move will be peacefully tolerated by the powers that be.Read More Are Sweatshops Coming To America ",hate
"Is there any merit in taking a cynical view of life Are the observations of cynicism realistic, brave observations on human nature, freed from sentimentality, or are they only the somber commentary offered by one who is a loser at the game of life, taking solace in his weakness and failure There are compelling arguments either way. What is not disputed, however, is that Franois de La Rouchefoucauld was one of the most brilliantly cynical epigrammers who ever lived.It probably did not help that he came from a long line of noblemen, for nothing so enfeebles the soul as much as inherited wealth and titles. He was born in 1613 and inherited the title of duke on the death of his father in 1650. Receiving the usual education of his class, he dabbled in military matters in his teens. Various itinerant love affairs followed with wellplaced women, but some of these ended badly we find him imprisoned in Bastille for a week in 1636 for political intrigue.Although married, he continued to pursue other women, as was the custom of the time and his station. Marriages in those days were business affairs to be ignored at each partys pleasure or necessity one such dalliance resulted in an illegitimate child, but the woman eventually rejected him for a more appealing competitor. In 1652 he found himself mixed up with a quasirevolt called the Fronde, an adventure that left him with impaired sight when he was struck with a musket ball in the head. Health problems also intervened to add to his misery in the form of gout and melancholy.In late seventeenth century France, the Paris salons were centers of debate, discussion, and the flowering of controversial ideas. By now La Rochefoucauld had acquired an acrid talent for stinging prose, and he knew how to use it. His failures in love and war had primed his spirit for a cynical view of life, and this predilection meshed well with the taste of the salons for savage wit. Nothing is so shallow as sophistication.From his frequent visits to the salon of Mme. de Sable in Paris, he had begun to piece together a body of epigrams that represented his worldview. One of his peers had more commercial goals in mind, for a bootleg collection of 189 of his sayings was first published without his permission and with no attribution in 1663. Two years later he finally put out a proper edition this contained 317 maxims. The volume was titled Sentences et maximes morales , but this is usually shortened to Maxims. There is a philosophy here. It centers around the idea that all men are selfseeking egoists to a fault any virtue a man displays is only a smokescreen concealing his selflove Our virtues are only vices in disguise. Human vanity takes precedence over nearly all else Virtues are lost in selfinterest, as rivers are in the sea. Even the nobler emotions like love and altruism, according to La Rochefoucauld, are only a kind of traffic in which selflove ever proposes to be the gainer. He took a dim view of women, finding them fit only for love for men such as himself, of course and procreation. One of his crueler maxims was few womens worth lasts longer than their beauty.But lifes realities eventually caught up with him, softening his rougher edges. His wife, who had cared for him in his infirmities for eighteen years, died in 1670 his mothers death followed two years later. Two of his sons would eventually die of injuries received in Frances ruinous wars of the period.This gloomy picture was brightened by the entry into his life of the Mme. de La Fayette, who was twenty years his junior. She invited him to stay with her in Paris, and he was carried there with difficulty. She seems to have viewed him as a reform project she would later say that He gave me understanding, but I reformed his heart. Perhaps his fame made him an interesting captive. The union worked, and seemed to alleviate his dark picture of humanity and when his final hours came, he asked for, and received, the last rites of the Church in 1680.A fair assessment of La Rochefoucauld must take into account his undeniable wit, his probing sensitivity, and his ability to strip away the pretenses behind many human actions. Yet all in all, his maxims are meager in result. Many of them are superficial and shallow, the product of a personality still nursing the wounds of an early disillusionment. We weary of his aphorisms after two or three pages, and hesitate to reopen his book later.Worse still, he was wrong to say that virtue and altruism are shams. Nothing is more vital to life, and we can see them around us every day, if only we know where to look, and as long as our senses are not blinded by fear. Timor animi auribus officit , as Sallust says fear blocks out the ears.Any bitter weakling can be a cynic, but it takes depth of character to accept the worldsand mansfaults and foibles, and to balance those against mans unquestioned capacity for greatness of soul. Broader life experiences might have corrected La Rochefoucaulds errors, but he preferred to remain in a state of arrested development while receiving the applause and notoriety of Paris society. His maxims can bring smiles to our faces, as it is easy to find amusement in the flaws of others yet we forget that his barbs were directed at us as well.Montaigne was far wiser, for he took a balanced view of life, accepting the worlds absurdities and joys with the equanimity and calm resolution of a Greek or Roman sage. He was also a better man. La Rochefoucauld was intelligent without being wise, and never found the confidence in himself to submit his ego to the consolatory power of a higher philosophical authority in any form. Cynicism, in the end, strips a man of his most important protective armor, and leaves him naked to face the cruelties of life. No cynic ever died a happy man.Read More 7 Tips On How To Get Into The Best Shape Of Your Life ",hate
"  6 Reasons Why Youre Not Happy 6 Reasons Why Youre Not Happy Corey is an aspiring iconoclast. He believes that the key to life is for men to honour their primal nature. Learn more about his views at theprimalmale.com You can also follow him on Twitter . November 7, 2016 Mind Happiness its what we all want as human beings no matter the differences in where we seek them. We are motivated to do things to be happy and we avoid things that may detract from it. Even those who claim that they dont care about happiness or that theyre living for a higher purpose is doing what they do because it makes them happy. In that way, happiness is beyond a state of feeling it is a state of being. Now, although you dont want to be obsessive about happiness and make your life revolve around attaining it, there are few things you can do to live a more fulfilling life and improve the quality of your being. And as its often the case with selfimprovement, I believe that addressing the bad habits will lead to a healthier life than trying to gain the positives. Here are some ways you may be sabotaging your own happiness. 1. You are chasing it Ill be happy once I finally The more you chase happiness, the less you have of it. And not only are people today chasing happiness, theyre chasing all the wrong things in hopes that it will bring them everlasting joy. Money, women, and status may elevate your life, but they cant be the source of happiness alone. They will especially fail as being compensation for some void in your life that youre trying to fill. Also, know that your mood will naturally fluctuate over time. Constantly obsessing over how you feel and getting stressed over your emotional state will not help you. So, rather than jumping from one thing to another in hopes that it will boost your mood or dull your pain, focus on things that matter to you. Its far better to work on selfimprovement and enhancing the overall quality of your life than be wavered by feelings. 2. You dont have the basics taken care of Good sleep is extremely underrated in our busy society. It affects your mood, testosterone level, mental capacity, and more. Prioritize sleep as much as you do with healthy diet and working out. Its often the basics that are overlooked. Ask yourself Are you sleeping well its harder to tell than you think Are you eating healthy Are you keeping yourself fit Are you getting enough sunlight Do you ever take the time to connect with nature Do you have a stable life Do you have a purpose or a meaning I doubt most people have all of these basic needs checked off. But Im willing to bet that an improvement in even one area will significantly improve a persons mood and well being. 3. You concern yourself with things you cant control No Something bad is happening in the world and I cant do jack shit about it Time to complain about it on the internet. The more you sweat over issues which you can take no practical action over, the more helpless you feel and the more unhappy you will be. Of course, being able to tell the difference between what you can control and what you cant is an art in itself that you need to master through experience. One thing Im personally doing to lower stress is to reduce my news consumption and be less concerned with events around the world that are irrelevant to my personal life. Ill read enough to get a general awareness of whats happening around the world, but I refuse to be emotionally invested in things I have no control over. 4. You lack intimacy and deep human connection If you dont have any friends to be vulnerable with, you didnt have any to begin with. I would argue that this is one of the biggest, if not the biggest factor in causing anxiety, depression, and general unhappiness in the modern world. Humans are social creatures and we need to bond with others. And beyond simply spending time with people to chat and drink, deeper connection needs to be made with people. The quality matters much more than the quantity. In todays societyespecially in North Americait seems people have all become superficial and afraid of intimacy whether it be for friendship or romance. Without opening up your true self due to the fear of being rejected or ridiculed, all the relationships you have with others will not be genuine and it will not be fulfilling. 5. You are not living in the present reality You may be conscious, but are you aware If you live in the past or the future, you lose touch with the present reality. That disconnection will cause longing which can only lead to dissatisfaction and loss of joy. The lure of nostalgia and daydreaming of a better life or an improved world is actually quite insidious because of how intoxicating it is. When your mind drifts to imagining a pleasurable experience or a more exciting life, you are tricked into thinking that the longing is happiness itself, sort of like how mirages work. On the contrary, studies have actually shown that you are actually happier and more productive when you focus on what youre doing right now even if the task is boring. So, stick to the reality and forget about your fantasies. Either make things happen or accept that youre just wasting your time and energy on wishful thinking. 6. You engage in junk activities Im happy, Im happy, Im happy Just as there are junk foods, there are junk activities that may feel pleasurable at the time but dissatisfying and even harmful in the longrun. Ask yourself do you really need entertainment Ive squandered my youth by immersing myself in long hours of digital entertainment day after day. I barely even noticed that I was unhappy the whole time because I was so sedated. And what did I even get out of them Those were several hours everyday that I could have spent reading, working out, learning new skills, meeting new people, and experiencing the world. The fact is, giving up on entertainment has no negative impact on your level of happiness. Sure, you might miss them when theyre suddenly gone, but overall, as long as you find more valuable things to do, your life can only get better when you ditch them. Learn to enjoy things that give you value rather than seeking enjoyment in things without value. Conclusion Unlike what many people today say, no one deserves happiness thats something youll have to earn. Ill go as far as to say that happinessas defined by modern standardsisnt even necessary and hard to come by for certain individuals. Everyone has their own path towards living life to his unique potential and there is no universal rule that applies to all. So while I havent really listed anything specific for the reader to strive towards, I hope I laid out some pitfalls that you can avoid in your journey. Nov 7, 2016 Corey Savage",hate

"  Is Hillary Clintons Entourage Involved In A Satanic Pedophile Ring Is Hillary Clintons Entourage Involved In A Satanic Pedophile Ring JeanBatave Poqueliche JeanBatave is a martial artist from the viking stronghold of Normandy, France. He travels the world looking for new fighting techniques and new beautiful women. Eastern Europe taught him everything he knows and is his second home. His column runs every Thursday. November 8, 2016 News The latest batch of the Podesta emails shared by Wikileaks add a darker dimension if it was even possible to the sordid culture of corruption, lies and depravity that surrounds Hillary Clinton, explaining why the FBI has been calling her for quite some time now, the Antichrist personified . It is a possibility that Hellarys clique attends and organizes Satanic rituals, involving mockup scenes of cannibalism and sexual abuse involving children. One of the emails directed at Tony Podesta John Podestas brother contains the following sentence I am so looking forward to the Spirit Cooking dinner at my place. Do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining This really does not sounds like much until you discover the author of this invitation. She, who walks in the footsteps of the Beast This is the woman who sent the email, Marina Abramovic. Dressed in red and holding the skinned head of a dead goat, a clear reference to the occult character Baphomet There is proof that the Clinton Foundation directly transferred Abramovic ten thousand dollars in at least one instance for her services. Abramovic carving a pentagram in the flesh of her stomach with a blade to show her artistic side A selfproclaimed artist, Abramovic hails from Serbia and regularly organizes performances and events using what she calls Spirit Cooking. This spirit cooking includes mixing semen, breast milk, urine or fresh blood before consuming it or splattering it over various things such as lifesized representations of young children, like shown below This performance included spelling with the body fluids, the following stanza With a sharp knife cut deeply into the middle finger of your left hand eat the pain. Other examples of her art nowadays any revolting expression of bad taste if sporting the correct pair of problem glasses include public dinners, where politicians, Hollywood stars, singers and decision makers gather to eat cakes that depict a naked human corpse or feast on the fake I hope by all that is sacred blood contained in a coffin where swims another human body. Celebrities that use demonic symbols in their persona such as Lady Gaga rush to participate to Abramovics events Another heavy user of the occult symbols, JayZ, is a big fan of Marina These codes are all directly copied from rituals such as black masses or Sabat night reunions and popularized by figures such as Aleister Crowley from whom Abramovic draws direct inspiration. It is part of this growing phenomenon where the elites and celebrities close to power get caught, intentionally or not, showing symbols celebrating the ancient Babylonian rites or the worship of the Devil. On November the 4th, Clinton chose JayZ in a last bid to draw crowds to her empty rallies. Coincidence Innocent children involved in that mess There is hard evidence that Bill Clinton traveled at least 26 times sometimes without his bodyguards, it is all in the pilot logs to billionaire and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epsteins Island on board his plane, dubbed the Lolita Express, as it is in this plane that the guests could allegedly have sex with minors. With this in mind, it is disturbing to notice that other Podesta emails refer to children as being the entertainment at pool parties almost entirely attended by middleaged men involved in politics. Other emails involve strange references to food such as pizza, cheese, 65,000 worth of hot dogs for a party that attendees dream of and recipes that many sources suggest are code words for orgies involving minors and extremely young children. You can read more about it here . The Whole Clinton Bag of Crooks reeks of unnatural sexual behaviour and reproachable acts and we will certainly know much more in the days to come, as Hillary Clinton is still under FBI investigation as we speak. This follows the scandal surrounding Huma Abedin Clintons right hand and confidant and her estranged husband, sex offender and champion onehanded texter, Anthony Weiner. It will take some time before they go through Weiners 650,000 emails and decide of a course of action regarding these dark revelations and other atrocities of the Clinton crime family. La plus belle ruse du diable est de vous persuader quil nexiste pas Drawing by Ben Garrison These heavy accusations of Satanism remind us of the sexual blackmail practices said to take place among the popular hiphop and Hollywood communities, as Roosh described in his related article , or other rumours linked to suspicious reunions involving the secret ceremonies of the elite such as the ones of the Bohemian Grove or the Rothschilds parties of the 70s. If those recent speculations turn out to be true, it could have the effect of a bomb and mean a revolution. Observe the symbols of cannibalism, eerily similar in the three following pictures. Those are respectively a scene of the Rothschilds surrealistic bal, a painting hanging in John Podestas office and one of Abramovics dinners I will let you be the own judge of the conclusions inspired by those images.

"A gateway between Western and Eastern Europe lies on the Charles River in the Czech RepublicPrague. Its been a Western tourist hotspot for many years now. Many people consider it a city overrun by the Westerners. Ruined, and no longer worth it.Ive spent the last month of my travels here in Prague, and have had a good opportunity to contrast to a place further east Ukraine. With that being said, here are 10 observations Ive made about Prague.1. Yes, Its Overrun, BUT That doesnt mean you cant find places that arent overrun. Yes, if you choose to stay in Prague zone 1, youre going to have a drastically different experience. There will be hoards of people with selfie sticks, and fat Western girls wobbling all over Old Town blocking the already narrow streets.If you head out to Prague 2, 3, 5, etc., youll have a much different experience. Youll get to meet some locals, try beer other than Staropramen, and avoid the throngs of tourists.Of course, its important to note that Prague is a beautiful city. Its natural to want to see some of the sights. If you choose to go this route, theres simply no way around it.2. The Reaction From Locals Changes Over Time Simply put, locals are used to Westerners. And most of them roll their eyes at them. However, once they know that youve laid down some semipermanent roots, theyre far more friendly.Just the cashiers at the market below my apartment have done a complete 180 on me in the few weeks Ive been here. It went from a general coldness that they show all English speakers to genuine warmth.3. The Beauty Of The City Is Unreal This is my third time in Prague, and Im still blown away by how beautiful of a city it is. From the castle to the riverwalks to all the colorful buildings, its just a very pleasant place to be. There are a lot of beautiful cities in Europe, but Prague is definitely near the top of all of them.You cant really blame people for wanting to come and see it.4. Cheap By Western Standards, Expensive By EE Simply put, if youre looking for shortterm rentalsyoure getting hosed. And theres not many ways around it. Prague landlords know the power of Western currency and know that the shortterm stag parties dont mind blowing it.Its far, far cheaper to sign a lease for a 3, 6, or 12 month period.A meal in a nice restaurant will probably run you between 812 USD. This is incredibly cheap compared to places like Italy, Spain, or London. At the same time, its definitely a bit more expensive than places such as Kiev, Budapest, or some cities in Poland.If you want actual numbers, Id say its about 30 more expensive than Kiev. Probably about 1015 more expensive than Budapest the last time I was there was April 2015, so keep that in mind, and just marginally more expensive than Poland.Of course as I keep harping on this, its going to get cheaper the further you go from the Old Town area.5. The Girls I know this is probably a large part of the reason youre reading this. So lets break it down. The girls are hot. Theyre not as hot as Ukrainian and Russian girls, but theyre a step above Polish women. At this point, its easy to see that any and all local Czech girls living in Prague are basically immune to foreigners. You arent going to impress a girl by swooping in for a weekend and renting out a great pad with a view of the Old Town. In fact, shed probably rather do almost anything but hang out in that area.However, being a foreigner will give you some major value if youre living there. In Colombia, girls will bang you just because youre a foreigner. In Ukraine, theyll probably at least give you one date for being foreign. In Prague, theyll do neither especially the high quality ones. However, the same things apply if youre living there or coming back consistently.Plus, its not exactly rocket science to be higher value than the drunken tourists stumbling around. Just keep your liquor in check, and avoid putting a GoPro on your headyoull already be ahead of the game.6. ConclusionIs It Livable When you come from a place like Ukraine, Prague feels much more like home. The English is better, and it has a more Western feel. You can find the larger supermarkets and other comforts that are often rare in the Former Soviet Union countries Ukraine, Belarus, etc..The question is whether or not its worth it to deal with what comes with those Western amenitieshigh amounts of tourism and a general feel of it being taken over. Theres no denying that Prague has probably lost a lot of luster for the adventurous single man compared to how it was 20 years ago.However, Prague is definitely a good spot for a digital nomad to settle in and get some work done. The internet is fast, the city is interesting, and there are good expat groups that put on cool things to do.You could do a lot worse.Read More 5 Habits All Successful Seducers Share ",hate
"A favorite trope of feminists and women claiming workplace discrimination is that female staff are the victims of sexism due to judgments about their appearance. But how many times have we all seen girls working in our building or out on their lunch breaks in attire more befitting of a Tinder date, raunchy nightclub, strip joint, or even the gym Meanwhile, men must keep their fashion within a very narrow range of acceptability, otherwise they risk failing to get that fancy new job or could lose their current one.Furthermore, guys learn to deal with the fact that the world does judge you based on your appearance. Many women have zero idea about this concept, only accepting the judgments they agree with or those ones that further their interests and career. For those opinions they dont like, they can always conveniently claim the person giving them is sexist or misogynist, or, just as amorphously, objectifying a woman. This is classic attentionseeking.Attentionwhore Jayde Phoenix.The epitome of this growing female narcissism is a British woman by the name of Jayde Phoenix . Touting herself as a IT security expert despite her academic and job credentials being a fraction of what it means to be highly qualified or plain nonexistent, she suggested a guess the number of USBs in a jar competition to promote her company. With her breasts nearly spilling out of a seethrough top, she looked at the camera with a lustful gaze, what many on the Roosh V Forum would call a thousand cock stare. Her clothes and demeanor better suited a street hooker than a professional.As we should have expected in our troubled times, the many critics of Phoenixs contrived appearance were labeled as sexists, bullies, and misogynists. She herself tried to excoriate her detractors, emphasizing how good she was at her job and the professional standards she supposedly meets every day. But there are a few questions both the original photo exercise and her subsequent justifications failed to answer, namelyIf shes so good at her job, why did she need to use a seethrough bra in the picture Why doesnt she wear a top size that comfortably contains her breasts, rather than flaunting them Why is she and not someone else in the photo Though the attentionseeking of Jayde and her employer first flared up several months ago, the dilemma of girls like her is an ongoing one.Try getting employed in an office as a man with this sort of attire Baggy pants with your underwear showing The male office worker could be wearing black pants and not jeans, like in the photo, and sporting a typical business shirt. That doesnt matter. No white collar company worth a dime is going to hire a man whose boxers or briefs are showing down to his ass. Compare this to the parade of female office workers who go beyond showing their arms and the hint of a bra strap to exhibiting half the surface area of their breasts. In addition, if you havent already noticed, the very short crop top is now a staple garment within American office unculture. It is not unusual to see a large part of a womans bare stomach and back, including overthetop tattoos.Hawaiian shirts and board shorts Some workplaces, most notably those trying to appear hip, have drastically relaxed the need for business attire. But these employers are definitely in the minority. A man with a penchant for Hawaiian shirts, board shirts or other beach clothing will find his career options drastically limited. As they should be The way in which you relate to your friends or fellow tourists on a holiday is almost always far different from how you should deal with clients, investors, stakeholders and the like in your profession. Men save their best or worst Hawaiian shirt for office charity fundraising days, company summer parties and related functions, not an average day.Leather, lycra or ridiculously tight clothing in general Inasmuch as tight clothing on men doesnt tickle your or my fancy, its how ironic how an obese woman can wear garments twice or thrice as closefitting in the workplace than a fit male. And, male office workers of the world, dont even consider wearing leather pants during your next boardroom presentation. The occasional gay man or metrosexual might escape sanction for some outlandish or garish outfit, but most industries, if they value their reputation with clients, will prohibit you from donning clothing that looks like it came from the wardrobe of Lance Armstrong or someone from Queer Eye for the Straight Guy .Excuses for female attentionseeking are out of control It seems that Lady Victoria Hervey and Jayde Phoenix read the same book.There is little doubt that Jayde Phoenixs employer expected a backlash against her. In this sense, it was a very good marketing and advertising ploy for those prospective clients who do not care about actual professionalism, of which there are many. As for Phoenix and other women like her, this situation is winwin. At the very least, she and those of her ilk can continue their daytoday objectification of themselves, generating desperately craved male attention in particular. Even for girls who do not receive the publics spotlight, any roadblock or mishap in their career can later be blamed on misogyny after judgments about their appearance.At best, as happened in Phoenixs situation, she gets nationwide and even global coverage. For narcissistic girls who take zero responsibility for how others may negatively perceive them, this is the coup of a lifetime. Yet as they age and Jayde Phoenix looks far older than her early 20s, expect their antics to become more strawclutching. And while these girls engage in sexual selfadvancement and wage war over imaginary discriminations, the vast majority of male employees have no scapegoat they can use to rationalize their failures and virtually no means of combating institutionalized prejudice against their socalled privilege.By the way, is Jayde Phoenixs Arabic necklace indicative of some work she may have done in DubaiRead More 6 Types Of Photos Girls Use To Attention Whore On Tinder ",hate

"Via AP  Donald Trump was elected Americas 45th president Tuesday, an astonishing victory for a celebrity businessman and political novice who capitalized on voters economic anxieties, took advantage of racial tensions and overcame a string of sexual assault allegations on his way to the White House.His triumph over Hillary Clinton will end eight years of Democratic dominance of the White House and threatens to undo major achievements of President Barack Obama. Hes pledged to act quickly to repeal Obamas landmark health care law, revoke the nuclear agreement with Iran and rewrite important trade deals with other countries, particularly Mexico and Canada.The Republican blasted through Democrats longstanding firewall, carrying Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, states that hadnt voted for a GOP presidential candidate since the 1980s. He needed to win nearly all of the competitive battleground states, and he did just that, claiming Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and others.Global stock markets and U.S. stock futures plunged deeply, reflecting investor alarm over what a Trump presidency might mean for the economy and trade.A New York real estate developer who lives in a sparking Manhattan highrise, Trump forged a striking connection with white, working class Americans who feel left behind in a changing economy and diversifying country. He cast immigration, both from Latin America and the Middle East, as the root of the problems plaguing many Americans and taped into fears of terrorism emanating at home and abroad.Trump will take office with Congress expected to be fully under Republican control. GOP Senate candidates fended off Democratic challengers in key states and appeared poised to maintain the majority. Republicans also maintained their grip on the House.Senate control means Trump will have great leeway in appointing Supreme Court justices, which could mean a major change to the right that would last for decades.Trump upended years of political convention on his way to the White House, leveling harshly personal insults on his rivals, deeming Mexican immigrants rapists and murderers, and vowing to temporarily suspend Muslim immigration to the U.S. He never released his tax returns, breaking with decades of campaign tradition, and eschewed the kind of robust data and field efforts that helped Obama win two terms in the White House, relying instead on his large, freewheeling rallies to energize supporters. His campaign was frequently in chaos, and he cycled through three campaign managers this year.His final campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, touted the teams accomplishments as the final results rolled in, writing on Twitter that rally crowds matter and we expanded the map.The mood at Clintons party grew bleak as the night wore out, with some supporters leaving, others crying and hugging each other. Top campaign aides stopped returning calls and texts, as Clinton and her family hunkered down in a luxury hotel watching the returns.At 2 a.m., Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta told the crowd to head home for the night. Were still counting votes and every vote should count, he said.Trump will inherit an anxious nation, deeply divided by economic and educational opportunities, race and culture.Exit polls underscored the fractures Women nationwide supported Clinton by a doubledigit margin, while men were significantly more likely to back Trump. More than half of white voters backed the Republican, while nearly 9 in 10 blacks and twothirds of Hispanics voted for the Democrat.Doug Ratliff, a 67yearold businessman from Richlands, Virginia, said Trumps election would be one of the happiest days of his life.This county has had no hope, said Ratliff, who owns strip malls in the area badly beaten by the collapse of the coal industry. You have no idea what it would mean for the people if Trump won. Theyll have hope again. Things will change. I know hes not going to be perfect. But hes got a heart. And he gives people hope.Trump has pledged to usher in a series of sweeping changes to U.S. domestic and foreign policy repealing Obamas signature health care law, though he has been vague on what he could replace it with building a wall along the U.S.Mexico border and suspending immigration from countrys with terrorism ties. Hes also praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and spoken of building a better relationship with Moscow, worrying some in his own party who fear hell go easy on Putins provocations.The Republican Partys tortured relationship with its nominee was evident right up to the end. Former President George W. Bush and wife Laura Bush declined to back Trump, instead selecting none of the above when they voted for president, according to spokesman Freddy Ford.House Speaker Paul Ryan, a reluctant Trump supporter, called the businessman earlier in the evening to congratulate him, according to a Ryan spokeswoman.Read the entire story ",hate
"Gentlemen, Donald J. Trump is the new Presidentelect of the United States. Though a a few results may still be unclear, Trump has captured the perennial large battleground states of Ohio, Florida, Iowa, and North Carolina, plus Georgia. And, in a change not seen in more than a generation, he has seized Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.Pennsylvania and Michigan have not voted for a Republican Presidential candidate since 1988 and Wisconsin since way back in 1984. It appears also that states the Democrats thought were well and truly in the bag for them, such as Minnesota, Maine and Virginia, have stayed blue with only waferthin or very disappointing margins. The 2nd Congressional district of Maine, a state which divides its electoral votes along with Nebraska, has been called for the Republicans for the first time in nearly 30 years. The last time any Maine district voted for a GOP Presidential candidate was 1988, when George H. W. Bush seized all four electoral votes there.Importantly, too, avowedly liberal states have seen significant turnouts for Trump. For example, counts so far show that some 40 of voters in Connecticut and Rhode Island, states with even more liberal media bias than the nation generally, have opted for the racist, sexist, and homophobic Republican candidate. Their votes ultimately did not change the electoral college map, but it is heartening to know that even in the eye of the liberal storm, plenty of people are happy to support Trump. This is despite them facing fierce rebukes and, often enough, violence if they make their views public.The clown candidate has beaten 16 more experienced Republican challengers and now Hillary Clinton, the most elitebacked candidate in the worlds political history.As tonights results have shown, plenty of Trump voters in red and blue states alike have been forced to keep their beliefs quiet. Media airtime for proTrump views and stories has been deliberately minimized and frequently demonized by the major networks. Mainstream journalists such as Glenn Thrush , Wolf Blitzer , Jake Tapper , Jessica Valenti , and Brent Budowsky have been caught collaborating with both the DNC and Clinton campaign if you believe that these two groups are actually separate. This only increases the esteem in which the emphatic, resounding Trump victory needs to be held.And lets not forget the Senate and House races After months of spineless GOP cucks rushing to differentiate themselves from Trump, The Donald has still carried them to victory in both Houses of Congress . The White House, Senate and House of Representatives are all in Republican hands until at least the 2018 House midterms. Can you taste the very salty tears of the liberals and SJWs yetEvery powerful vested interest not only supported Hillary, but did everything they could to ruin Trump Yes, its happening.Did you see the last major Hillary Clinton rallies Celebritiescumpolitical hacktivists, chief among them Lady Gaga, Beyonc, Jay Z, Bruce Springsteen, Bon Jovi, and Katy Perry, all fell into Clintons corner well before their final appearances for her, excoriating anyone who had the gall to support Donald Trump. Even longterm Republicans who betrayed Trump, like Arnold Schwarzenegger, were attacked by celebrity SJWs such as Robert DeNiro after they joined the Never Trump ranks, as if they were dangerous saboteurs. The celebrity paranoia has been palpable for months. Hollywood, that broad industry taking in not just film stars but also singers, silver screen actors, and comedians, has become little more than an overpaid trade union for Hillary Clinton.Likewise, every major American company that has come out for a candidate has come out for Hillary. Plenty of neutral corporations have undoubtedly been funneling support to the Clinton campaign behind the scenes as well. Prominent billionaires like George Soros and Warren Buffett have done all they could to drag Hillarys stumbling halfcorpse, both literally and figuratively, across the line. Whilst Trump has been supported by a number of tenfigure businessmen, these men are regularly attacked in the media. They include the scapegoated but brave Peter Thiel and Carl Icahn.And then theres the mainstream media. Countless studies have indicated that about 8590 of all journalists are liberal. This overrepresentation is more salient still in the upper echelons of newsmen and women, particularly prominent mastheads such as The New York Times , Washington Post , and Huffington Post , plus Democratic TV surrogates like CNN and NBC. The 2016 campaign has inflated this preexisting liberal bias, one that plagued the two George W. Bush Administrations but raged even more ferociously against Donald Trump over the last 18 months.All of these media elites have lambasted Trump for over a year, at the same time they give the paltriest coverage of the disgusting Hillary, Podesta and DNC emails. Everything newsworthy on this front, from the overwhelming presence of Clinton Foundation donors in Hillarys Secretary of State diary book to more recent revelations about John Podestas involvement with Satanic rituals, has been brushed off the balcony by the Wolf Blitzers and Chuck Todds of the American mainstream media. Yet Trump has triumphed nonethelessThe new administration must crush the criminal Democratic elites and Clinton Foundation with the rule of law Will Hillary now find herself stumbling into jailInasmuch as the Clinton campaign, the SJWs, and their big business and media enablers have been defeated in this years election, they retain very welloiled and effective means for trying to undermine President Trump once he takes office. Trumps first priority as CommanderinChief must be to remove the bureaucratic apparatchiks preventing a full and frank investigation of the Clinton Foundation. He also needs to clear the way for legal inquiries into the various criminal activities, as uncovered by Wikileaks, perpetrated from within the DNC and Hillary Clintons campaign.The Department of Justice in particular has engaged in all manner of skulduggery, most notably when AttorneyGeneral Loretta Lynch had a private meeting with Bill Clinton during the most crucial time of the FBI investigation into Hillarys emails. Additionally, elements of the State Department illegally informed Hillary about new developments in that same case. Enough is enough. Its time to drain the swamp.Election night produced another curveball after weeks of calling Donald Trump a sore loser for him not saying if he would respect the final result, Hillary Clinton refused to speak to her supporters and the American people. It would seem that she only telephoned Trump privately. So whos the sore loser nowLast night we were witnesses to the greatest electoral seachange in Americanand perhaps globalhistory. We cannot lose sight of the work to be done, but for the next 24 hours we can bask in this unprecedented victory against all odds.Hail to the Chief, Donald J.

"Firearms panics happen over a variety of things, like acts of domestic terrorism, mass shootings, or Democrats getting elected to office. Though we may not have to worry about this for a few years after 2nd Amendment enthusiast Donald Trumps decisive victory last night, lets cover our bases and talk about a panic if future Democrats are elected.What is a panic for ammo and firearms A panic is when people go and buy items just to have them because they are worried that there will soon be no more, or it will be illegal to buy and sell such items, but maybe not to own them already, as most Americans still believe in the no ex post facto laws part of the Constitution.Adding to a panic is speculators, who buy from retailers who are roundly shamed if they raise their own prices, only to resell privately at much higher levels. While this is legal, it certainly isnt ethical or a decent thing to do, and these folks deserve being shamed and mocked at every opportunity.Lastly, the gun stores or sites inventory cannot handle the flex in the buying demand, nor can the manufacturer, and an artificially contrived panic creates a real scarcity that can only be corrected by the panic running out of steam as everyone buys what they consider to be enough and natural undercutting resets the price back to lower levels.Some prices never return. 22 Long Rifle ammunition has still not totally recovered from the damage old Brock the Islamic Shock Obama did to it with his multiyear championship of Best Firearms Salesman Ever, and it may be even worse under the Bitch in Chief.So, what gets grabbed in a panic What should you get What should you count on still being available Weve got three categories guns, ammo, and components/accessories.Guns Anything thats big on the liberal hit list is a first target for a ban, so its a first target for a panic. Look for things that are popular with the right, and scary to the left. Also look for things that are modern no one is going to ban the M1 Garand anytime soon.Evil features matter more than destructive power. Anyone who knows anything about guns knows that the AK47 and the AR15 fire intermediate cartridges that are puny enough to be considered inhumane in several states with which to hunt deer as they lack the power to kill the animal with marginal shots. However, theyre black and have mean things attached to them, so theyre on the shit list, while a nice blued with wooden stock scoped bolt action rifle in a magnum cartridge capable of wrecking your world from twice the distance that an AR can pull is safe as it looks traditional.They have to be popular to the left to get noticed rifles like the FAL and anything based of the G3/HK91 action simply dont have enough exposure to get targeted, unless they pull something sweeping like the USC 18 922r rules again. The Mini 30 and the M1A might be safe maybe.For pistols, pretty much any semiautomatic of the polymer age is fair game to want banned. Oftentimes, stupid rules like restrictive magazine sizes get pushed. 1911s, Hi Powers, other old domestic semiautos, and revolvers should be safe. Expect the libtards to go after Glocks and the like.Shotguns seem to be immune these days as theres not a whole lot of difference between a hunting gun and a combat gun other than paint and mag tube length. I think the Saigas are still not being imported, and its about the only box mag fed one out there, but anything else makes a good home defense gun that should also be immune to the ammo panic portion as well.Ammunition Range full metal jacket and defense/hunting hollow or soft point cartridges in popular centerfire calibers and 22 Long Rifle will almost literally evaporate from your local store and online, and its probably beginning as I write this.Oddly enough, only certain rounds will suffer panic buying. For rifles, its limited to .223/5.56, 7.6239, and .308/7.6251. Traditional hunting rounds like 3030, .243, and .270 do not seem to be impacted. Why doesnt 3006 get bought in a panic As the old joke goes, men with 3006s dont panic, but it really has to do with the feedback cycle I mentioned at the start. If theres little demand, it cannot exceed the instore supply, so the perception of it being gone for good cannot occur.Everything but the shotgun shell and the howitzer round to the far right will sell fast in a panic.Panic bought pistol ammo is the big 3 9mm Luger, 40 SW, and .45 ACP. .380 will round out the affected semiautomatic rounds, and there usually is a bit of a run on .357 Magnum and .38 Special as well. 10mm, .357 SIG, .45 GAP and other magnums like the .44 do not seem to be affected.For rimfires, .22 Long Rifle just goes poof, while its Magnum brother and smaller, 17 caliber, cousins do not seem to be as affected. Rimfires are not reloadable, and this contributes to their overstockpiling.Components and Accessories Most centerfire ammo is reloadable, and the serious amongst shooters will roll their own for economy, selfreliance, and performance, so the consumable components will also get some panics. Although Ive held off on reloading articles until I get my press set back up, we can hit up the components that will get panic bought briefly.Biggest thing is primers, even bigger than the bullets, oddly enough. The primer is the little metal cup that gets smacked by the firing pin and sets off the powder in modern cartridges, and they come in two sizes for pistols, two for rifles, and of varying hardness to satisfy military specifications.The second is gunpowder itself. Fortunately, theres a wide variety of smokeless powder, and everyone tends to have the brands and formulas they prefer, so it takes a little less of a hit than the primers. The third is the bullets, and since there are so many types and manufacturers, they also take a little less of a hit than primers. While you obviously need all three to reload, bear that in mind. Always save your brass, and anyone elses you can pick up.Even though the little ones are easier to use, the higher capacity ones disappear first. Get both.While it is always a good idea to have spare springs and small parts like firing pins and extractors that are prone to breakage, the number one accessory or part to take a hit in panics is the box magazine, especially high capacity ones. I dont mean the 200 round drum mags, although those do take a dive, nor do I really mean the 100 round coffin mags, but I mean the full capacity full sized pistol mags, like a 15 round mag for a full sized pistol, or a 30 round AR15 mag. Expect to see Pmags and surplus style aluminum AR mags just vanish. The Gabby Giffords Special, the extended Glock 17 30 round mag, is also a contender for vanishing fast in a panic.Holsters, slings, cleaning accessories, optics, and ammo cans seem to be immune from panics.What to do If you already own a carbine and/or a semiauto pistol, make sure you have enough ammo, magazines, and spare parts. Its a lot better to have one gun with multiple mags and a lot of ammo than many guns with the one or two mags with which they came from the factory and a couple boxes of ammo.I try to have at least six mags for my semiauto pistols, and at least ten mags for my semiauto rifles. Get some rifle mags of different sizes, the 30 and 40 AR mags are fun for shooting standing up, but they get in the way of prone firing and the 10 and 20 rounders are preferable.Your ultimate ammo goal, I maintain, should be a thousand practice rounds and 500 defense rounds for each gun you have, but, in a prepanic or panic situation, just get what you can at a normal price some is better than none. If youre into reloading, you know what to get already.If you dont own anything, and want to soon, refer to some pistol articles , a rifle article, a shotgun article, and a buying guide here. Consider buying some stripped AR lowers to build on a rainy day later on.Build an AR and meet girls at the rangeConclusion No matter who got elected, I think this country is in for rough times. Its always better to have firearms and not need them, then not have them and need them. Store yours safely, but accessible and ready in times of need. Read More 5 Firearms A Man Should Own ",hate

"  5 Things America Can Learn From Hungarys Resistance Against The Migrant Masses 5 Things America Can Learn From Hungarys Resistance Against The Migrant Masses The PAPRIKA PLUTOCRAT is a spicy capitalistic Hungarian blogger. Follow his unyielding assaults against Cultural Marxism on his blog, paprikaplutocrat.com November 10, 2016 Politics On the 2 nd of October Hungary has seen a stunning manifestation of national unity, as 98 of votes cast on a referendum regarding the EUimposed migrant settlement quotas were declared a strong and undebatable no. Now the Hungarian national parliament works at incorporating the referendum results as an amendment to the countrys constitution. While some leftwing news outletslike the Guardiancelebrated the supposed inadequacy of the referendum, it is beyond dispute that the message of the voting is strong and firm. Here are five lessons we can learn from this monumental stand against globalism. 1. Democracies Need Strong Leaders Wimpy western politicians would have their voters believe that personality does not matter. Strong, witty, and masculine politicians are often depicted as exponents of a fascistic personality cult. Nowadays, it seems, not much distinction is made between being a macho and being a Nazi. In reality, all great western democratic leaders were strong menand sometimes women. Winston Churchill, Charles de Gaulle, David BenGurion, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher were not known for being timid, politically correct politicians who would retract and apologize for every past comment that theyve made. Do you think that todays EU politicians and Western leaders could have beaten Hitler or won the Cold War Hungarys Viktor Orbn might have some faults, but he is certainly not a shy and weak politician who lacks magnetism. Even his opponents will grant him that he has a rare political talent and an almost visionary skill for seeing future happenings think of how one year ago Hungary was the first European country to build a wall to keep the migrant wave out. Today, most countriesfrom Austria to Great Britainfollow his lead. Just listen to his 15 th March, 2015 speech made on Hungarys national holiday commemorating the countrys 1848 freedom fight against the Habsburgs. Look at how he is standing in the rain, without some guy holding an umbrella over his head. This man has speaking skills, grand views, and balls The idea that Western democracies can function with leaders who have the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a lowgrade bank clerkto quote Nigel Farage who has so sharply put it to Herman van Rompuyis a lie and has no foundation in reality. Democracy is about the masses the masses need inspiration and leaders democratic leaders therefore have to be strong and need game themselves. I am personally a friend of monarchies, and I have libertarian arguments for it but as long as the western world believes in democracy, we cannot have cucks and wimps protecting it. 2. Liberty Is Protected By The RightWing Anyone who believes in game enjoys the fruits if Western liberal capitalism, like it or not. Yes, the modern world has its faults, but freedom of speech, freedom of sex life, freedom of entrepreneurship and freedom of travel are all essential parts of our lifestyle. Of course, these are tenets that the left hates today in fact, if you want to live free and live a masculine lifestyle, the liberalism of today is certainly not your friend. Therefore Im going to write about liberty, and not liberalism. One can debate the difference between these terms in short, what I mean is that the left today doesnt want you to be free, but wants a politically correct nanny state to control and plan every move you make, and punish you if you do not oblige. The right, however, still stands for the basic concept of personal liberty that we have grown to love and respect. Hungary has been criticized a lot by leftwing groups for having curbed some freedoms I will agree that some of these state actions were unnecessary and hardly defensible. But Hungaryand EasternEuropetoday still has more freedom than some corners of the ohsoliberalandtolerant Western world. In Hungary, universities rarely propagate the debased agenda of social justice wars cultural Marxism is regularly attacked and barely tolerated feminism is rare and marginal, and the country is, overwhelmingly, conservative and right wing the governing party with twothirds of parliamentary seats is centreright, the largest opposition party is openly farright. In the capital city of Budapest, one of the best and cheapest cities for nightlife and gaming in Europe, you will certainly not be prosecuted for stopping hot girls and asking for their numberunlike some Western cities. 3. Minorities Are Misled The Hungarian pressmuch outside of the view of the grand world, due to our rarely known and complicated languagehas been in throes for the past few months about the migrant crisis. Like most Eastern European countries, Hungary barely has any immigration or Muslims. In fact, if theres a black person on the street, people will often turn their heads. Debates that have been present in the Western mediaabout Muslim integration, terror and Islam, Palestine and Israel have only recently surfaced in the Hungarian press. Minorities, of course, have been misled by the leftwing press into believing that the migrants were refugees, poor victims whom he have a responsibility to assist. The Jewish press meaning official Jewish congregation organs, not conspiracy theories and LGBT groups voiced their concern for tolerance and nonviolent communication. It is probably not a grand revelation to most readers of this site that Muslim immigration brings little good to minorities. As Milo Yiannopoulos said in a lecture of his, the Muslims are not on top of the oppression ladder, but they want to kill all the others on the oppression ladder. Minorities have been misled into following the agenda of the political left the sight of Hungarys gay public personalities demonstrating for letting in Muslims in front the parliament is a clear proof of this. 4. Feminists Love Islam Feminism in Hungary is a rare bird, but it does exist. One such radical MarxistFeminist made the news when she openly argued that there could be no terrorists among Muslim refugees this, of course, was before the Paris and Brussels attacks, many of the perpetrators of which arrived as refugees through Hungary. A few days ago I stumbled across the Facebook page of another fine specimen this hardly attractive girl celebrated the empowerment of the hijab which, according to her, was a beautiful expression of females voluntary decision to defy the dating market. Describing such violent and shameful oppression of people as voluntary selfempowerment is crazy. Feminists live in denial of facts, and the recent alliance between crazy radical Islam and Marxist Feminism only proves that neither has any love for Western culture. 5. Eastern Europe Is Still OK The Western media gleefully celebrated the fact that with a voter turnout of a little more than 40, the 50 limit of required turnout was not reached. According to Hungarian laws however, a referendum with 25 or more electorate turnout is valid, even if not politically binding. The Hungarian government will soon amend the constitution to declare that Brussels cannot force the country to take in immigrants without the consent of the people. Such a policy is clear and sound. The message is that Eastern Europewith all its faults, economic lagging and sometimes real intoleranceis still a better place to live for masculine men that many a place in the western world. Here masculine lifestyle is appreciated, Donald Trump has grand supporteven Viktor Orbn voiced his good wishes for the Republican presidentelectand feminism has failed to win any serious ground. Eastern Europe is still not lost, and Hungary is certainly among the best options for men of game today.",hate
"There are some things that we have learned about the United States from this election. Well need to keep these in mind as we make efforts to return sanity to society.The federal government has been corrupted Probably the most shocking lesson of this election is that the entire federal government has been coopted to serve a single partythe Democrats. The best example of this was the behavior of FBI Director James Comey. The FBI is part of the Executive branch of government so Comey reports to Loretta Lynch, who in turn reports to Obama. Despite this fact, one expects that the FBI be allowed a high degree of discretion to honestly investigate individuals regardless of which political party they belong to. After all, the US was founded upon the idea that we are all equal before the law.Comeys actions reveal that the FBI has thrown equality before the law out the window. At first the FBI investigated Clintons use of an unsecure, personal email server to conduct national business while she was Secretary of State. But even though Clinton apparently violated several laws that have gotten other people severe jail sentences, Comey exonerated her back in July with a hand slap.In a move that surprised everyone, Comey reopened on October 28th the criminal investigation of Clinton after 650,000 emails State Department emails were found on pervert Anthony Weiners computer. Trump supporters rejoiced and Hillary supporters expressed outrage. But the White House calmly called Comey a man of integrity. Did they know something we didntIt turns out the fix was in from the beginning because just 48 hours before election day, Comey exonerated Clinton again . The FBI director likely intended to clear Clinton of wrongdoing before the election to defuse Donald Trumps criticism of her.The big lesson is that the law is applied selectively. Wealthy, politicallyconnected people dont need to play by the same rules as everyone else. Unless this situation is corrected, it means the rule of law is deadand that is a very grave lesson indeed.The elites are in control but Elites want you to believe they are super smart and super powerful like the Great Oz.Ive written many times about the control that globalist elites exert on the country through their control of the media, educational institutions, and politicians through the form of bribes donations, cushy job offers, speaking fees. By controlling the flow of information and setting the narrative, the globalists are able to control the masses like cattle. The good news is that their control is not complete. They are not omnipotent.The weakness of the elites has been demonstrated in three ways. The first was with the Brexit vote. When Prime Minister David Cameron agreed to hold a referendum on the UKs membership in the EU, he never dreamed that Britons would actually vote to leave. All the polls at the time showed that any movement to leave would go down in flames. Still, through the work of men like Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson, the British populace voted to leave the EU. The Brits on the leave side had to endure being called racist and look past polling that said they had no chance to win.The second way was the campaign of Trump himself. The GOP had planned a coronation for Jeb Bush. The rest of the GOP field was me too candidates who were virtually indistinguishable from Jeb. Trump came in with an uncompromising message and crushed Jeb and the rest of the little Jebs. The elite plan to have Hillary versus a weak conservative was completely thrown into disarray by Trumps campaign. Even if Trump has lost the general, it is still a victory because now, instead of seeing the Great Oz, we see the globalists behind the curtain.The third manifestation of the weakness of the elites is the rise of the Alt Right. A tiny group of young people on the internet was able to quickly wake up large segments of the population. Only a year ago, terms like nationalism and globalism were rarely heard in the US. Now, we have grandmothers in Texas tweeting about how we need to lay the axe to the globalists.The overall lesson is that we should not fear the globalist elite. They exist and they are able to fool a majority of the population, but not all of us. With sound strategy, they can be defeated.The Elite have completely divorced themselves from nonelites In the past, Europe had an aristocracy. This aristocracy had a close relationship with the rest of the people in the country. The aristocracy was expected to defend the nation in case of war. They also had the same religion as the rest of the country. We already knew that the modern aristocracy of the globalist elites has no responsibilities toward the rest of us, but, thanks to WikiLeaks, we have now learned that they dont even share the same religion.WikiLeaks revealed that Hillary Clinton and her campaign manager are close friends with Marina Abramovic, a Serbian artist who performs occult rituals she calls  spirit cooking . Spirit cooking appears to be set of magical rituals that use bodily fluids such as menstrual blood, urine, and semen to achieve certain goals, usually sexrelated. It also involves at least minor sacrifices one recipe calls for cutting ones figure and eating the pain.While spirit cooking is certainly grotesque, it is not my intention to focus on it except to point out that it has become a sort of initiation ritual into the US globalist elite. Hillary Clinton, John Podesta, JayZ and Beyonce, Lady Gaga, and Gwen Stefani have all attended these rituals and I would not be surprised to learn that many other politicians, CEOs, and bankers also participate. Getting invited to one of these spirit cooking sessions means that you have gained entry into the wealthy elite in the US. There are probably similar groups or rituals for the modern day European elites.There are several things at work here. Most of the spirit cooking participants probably dont believe in the efficacy of the spirit cooking ritual. It is more like a college fraternity initiation. It only means something in terms of ones social standing. Also, the satanic imagery of spirit cooking and its sexual overtones are big middle fingers to Christianity which our elite regard as the religion of the unwashed masses.In both of these ways, our modern elite have separated themselves from the rest of us. They dont share the same destiny as us. If the country starts going to hell, the wealthy elite can just pick up and move to another country or they can live in small, heavily guarded compounds, untouched by the damage their policies have caused. And they even lack a common morality with us. In their own eyes, their wealth has somehow put them beyond the traditional moral code that guides the rest of us.The fact that the elites have no regard for the rest of the country does not bode well for them. The aristocracy of old knew that their fortune was bound up with that of their countrymen. The modern elite lack this wisdom. Once enough of the hoi polloi realize it, it is only a matter of time before these pseudoelites are deposed from their pedestal.Conclusion With Trumps election, the problem of federal government being used for political purposes will be mitigated. However, the problems with our indulgent pseudoelite will continue to be a force that prevents the patriarchy from returning. In any case, we can be grateful that the election of 2016 has exposed some of the cancers that are eating away at our society.Read More Rigged FBI Reveals It Has Evidence Hillary Clinton Broke Law, But Will Not Prosecute ",hate
"  Why SoCalled Intellectuals Do More Harm Than Good To Society Why SoCalled Intellectuals Do More Harm Than Good To Society Andr is a young European who left his decaying country in 2012 for greener pastures. He enjoys exploring subterranean places, reading about a host of interconnected topics, and yearns for Tradition. November 11, 2016 Culture The existence of intellectuals is more ubiquitous today than ever. Many are those who contend for public attention, credibility, and money as a reward for their wits, not to mention the very status of intellectual. Yet the existence of such people is far from selfevident. For centuries, traditional societies barely had anything or anybody that looked like modern intellectuals, and this did not prevent them from lasting hundreds or even thousands of years. So, as we elaborate projects and ideas for reforming the depraved societies of the Empire of Nothinga necessary step if we want a lasting victoryan important question must be confronted do we need at all what has been called intellectuals during last centuries And if we do not, what should we have instead The origin of modern intellectuals At the heart of modernity lies a deep crisis. Before it, Western Europe was united by the same Christian faith and a basic agreement on the place of economysubordinated to guilds and the rights of the average producer. When modernity reared its philosophical head through Ren Descartes, a prominent thinker of the seventeenth century, the Old Continent was in a much more problematic state Christianity had splintered into various opposing faiths whose intellectual opposition was shaking everything to the core. We have been told that the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were a glorious new flourishing of intelligence. But, in fact, thinkers who actually lived at this time had quite a different impression. The Irish bishop George Berkeley 16851753 criticized how the practice of philosophy had become, on his age, synonymous with getting embroiled into thousand scruples prejudices and errors of sense, a situation he attributed to the wrong use we make of our faculties. Likewise, the Scottish philosopher David Hume 17111776 scolded his contemporaries for being too eager to criticize the systems of others for the sake of pushing their own on the scene, that is, a mutual hypercriticism that led to a general lack of certitude about everything There is nothing which is not the subject of debate, and in which men of learning are not of contrary opinions. The most trivial question escapes not our controversy, and in the most momentous we are not able to give any certain decision. Disputes are multiplied, as if everything was uncertain and these disputes are managed with the greatest warmth, as if everything was certain. Amidst all this bustle it is not reason, which carries the prize, but eloquence From hence in my opinion arises that common prejudice against metaphysical reasonings of all kinds. The first precursors were honest in their endeavour to solve the crisis. Descartes, Berkeley, Hume and many others genuinely sought a grand encompassing theory that could resume with all controversies. But soon the very controversy became an institution. A whole market of ideas was growing, in which more and more lettrs started to see an opportunity to make a name, thus earning fame, social standing and sometimes money. Hume could not help himself soon after criticizing those who fed the crisis by attacking the others systems while promoting their own, he was doing the same. Such was the socalled Enlightenment the further undermining of any spiritual, philosophical or cultural unity by ambitious individuals ready to hustle for notoriety. They would be experts at flattering the powerful, mocking the Catholic church, fiddle fashionable themes and witty prose, and more than everything else rationalizing their activity as a progress. The very expression Enlightenment stems from their willingness to market themselves to the posterity. The intellectuals bread and butter It can be noted that, from the amateur gentlemen of the eighteenth century, generations of scientists have sprang up. Some of these characters were mathematicians, engineers, doctors, or dedicated observers of nature, and they all contributed to improving general human power over matter . But make no mistake even science needs problems and unknown stuff to justify careers and research, thus following a headlong rush dynamic. At its side, the literary intellectuals need more problems so they can have the opportunity to sell themselves through claiming they want to solve them. The momentous crisis turned into a crisis structure and the structure turned into a mark of the modern West. Where God ceased to speak, the modern talking head took more and more territory and wrote dozens of books trying to prove he was the embodiment of progress. It doesnt matter if problems are genuine or artificial. Intellectuals need them like a blacksmith needs iron. Two typical intellectual characters are Voltaire and mile Zola. Both were gifted writers, both were charming and witty, both managed to write about matters that were actually relevant to their times, and both have used a trial with political overtones to make a show of themselves. Not so incidentally, both were French and participated to the furthering of a twisted literary chauvinism. Voltaire took advantage of various trials to claim that the defendants were accused because they were Protestants inside a Catholic country. The infamous affaire Calas , from the name of a father who was accused of having murdered his own son, was used by the shrewd philosophe to sending pathetic letters to the upper crust of the society, stirring the public opinion, pressuring magistrates, until the fatherwho had been convicted and executed after a thorough investigationwas rehabilitated. Two centuries and a half later, young Frenchmen are still taught Voltaire was a champion of truth, justice, and reason, whereas he was more like a playwright who peddled influence. Zola, more than a century later, did the same. A JewishFrench captain, Alfred Dreyfus , was convicted for high treason after he allegedly communicated secret documents to Prussia. Years later, some new evidence seemed to indicate that Dreyfus was innocent and that another officer had leaked the documents at this very moment, Zola published an incendiary article, Jaccuse , where he spat on the judges and cried about the injustice of the affaire . Eventually, Dreyfus was rehabilitatedand the army, the patriots and the Catholics were shamed through a neverending media discourse that casted them as villains of the whole story. Voltaire and Zola played the same role in a narrative of the exact same kind. We are taught about a situation of injustice, where the majority of the population is oppressing an innocent group through an innocent individual and crooked institutions. Fortunately, a heroic talking head rises, miraculously converts the opinion to recognize the poor innocent victim as such, the talking head is crowned as an awesome thinker beyond boundaries whereas some are fairly vilified as oppressors, and the poor victims rehabilitation is also the victory of reason, justice, and progress. Thus, the intellectuel in the most typical sense is a highly paradoxical creature who becomes taught in classes after having seemingly rebelled against dominant institutions. Teenagers are led to think that heroic and highly intelligent individuals can turn the tide of unfavourable opinion provided they follow a mysterious sense of history. There have been a lot more intellectuals than the mere classics, and often those rejected by the official narrative are more interesting than those inside. Whos gonna pay Even if you are gifted with words and language, being a talking head does not pay much. Would anyone be ready to pay you for giving an opinion, no matter how elaborate, on anything The problem of money is a good starting point to connect the dots Voltaire was close from wealthy Protestants bankers, one of whom even helped him to obtain a house in Geneva, and Zola was a Rotschild protg . Both of them contributed to tarnish Catholicism and most of their own people. In other words, they served interests that could pay themthey were sellouts. Today, some bloggers happen to earn money as independents, especially when they found themselves a niche. Yet independence is scarce. Way too many people would like to live from their wits, and, even more, obtain recognition as intellectuals. More than often, intellectual types turn into teachers, journalists, or even marketersthus depending upon an institution that pays them. In North America, the war against whites and masculinity is massively subsidized , whether in the academic or in the media. You wont easily find a job there if you take a critical stance on cultural Marxism. And in case you wouldnt be selfhating enough, they are already replacing you with minority individuals who are rewarded for spewing wordy venom daily. Old Marxism was wellaligned with the interests of intellectuals as a class, not as individuals. It handed them an official status and flattered their ego by casting them as the vanguard of progress. Keynesianism triumphed for the exact same reason as it justified the creation of a bloated State where modelobsessed nerds enjoy a tremendous power over those who produce actual wealth. Intellectual types historically joined the left because it gave them a status, money, and moral recognition. But the whole Marxist vocabulary of progress and emancipation dissimulated what seems glaring today. Namely, that intellectuals were recognized and paid, not because they were enlightened or bright, but because they were an efficient tool of destruction. The conservative right has often lacked a milieu for intellectual types. The average conservative was reluctant to pay someone he saw as a parasite. Such a lack pushed a number of high IQs to the arms of the left, who made an establishment out of them and paid them to enforce globalism, antiwhiteness, antimasculinity, pathological altruism, transgender madness, politically correct repression and so on. Intellectuals were never paid to say the truth they were paid as tools who performed a primarily destructive social function. If we happen to beat cultural Marxism, what shall we do with intellectual types If we are to dismantle globalism and build healthier societies, we have to think about what we will replace the bobo leftist establishment. The intellectual mediocrity and spinelessness of the average conservative is no solution. A truly traditional society would likely have initiates, something akin to high priests and knights, in lieu of vacuous and coward talkers. How exactly we go there or how exactly this could look today is another question. Conclusion The French essayist Alain Soral once famously said, a journalist is either a whore or without a job. This is even truer for most intellectuals, sold as they are to a destructive left or more seldomly to the inefficient right. Culture is overrated. What the mainstream refers to under that name is a giant matrix, full of lies, taboos, and the snobbery of talking heads who end up lying to everyone or believing into their own bullshit. No wonder why the shrewd Robert Greene advised to be an intense realist one must cultivate inner intuition and situational awareness not to fall prey to some of the claptrap that constitutes at least eighty per cent of current mainstream culture. The previous generations could join the cultural Marxist establishment and pretend their destructive, egoladen works were progress. To our generation, this is impossible. Either we stand up for our very existence, even if we must go against more than two centuries of manipulations and lies, or we resign ourselves to an ignominious death. Before we take the power back, a shared awareness must be stimulated, and this is where we enter in direct conflict with the wellfunded antiwhite, antimasculine establishment types, whom we must beat on their own field once and for all. Bonus 6 quotes about the intellectuels Some of the problems that modern philosophical thinking puts forward appear void of any importance and meaning. Modern philosophy features a range of issues that merely stem from an equivocal stance and the confusion of different viewpoints. These issues only exist because they are poorly framed. They have no fundamental reason to exist. In many cases, defining their statements more precisely may be enough to make them disappear, plain and simple, if modern philosophy did not strive to maintain them, because it makes a living out of ambiguity.  Ren Gunon, Introduction to the study of the Hindu doctrines , chap.8. Ren Gunon young Philosophers care much more about putting forth problems, no matter how artificial and illusory, than about solving them They also strive to link their name to a system, that is, to a strictly bounded set of theories they would own and consider as their nothing more than their own work. Hence the desire to be original at any price, even if the truth must be sacrificed on the altar of said originality. A philosopher who cares about his repute does better by making up a new mistake than by repeating some truth that has already been expressed by others. Ren Gunon, The Crisis of the Modern World , chap.5. Ren Gunon older The most evident feature of modern critique is the lack of principles and of authenticity. Its greater preoccupation consists in being brilliant, in appearing original From the point of view of those who embody this intellectuality, the catchy line, the dialectical or polemical posturing well noticed by others, have a much greater value than truth. Ideas, when they use them, are nothing but a pretext. What matters is to look intelligentjust as, to the mainstream politician, the ideology of a party is essentially a means for career. The vanity fair, the most deleterious subjectivism, often verging on pure and unmitigated narcissism, are essential components of this phenomenon The critique is a scourge of modern culture, an epidemic that was born out of bourgeois society concomitantly with the commodification of culture In normal, traditional civilizations, one could find creators, artists, and those who would judge the works without intermediaries the sovereigns, the patrons, and the people. Our times have witnessed the appearance, between the public and the creators, that cultural pimp, that cheeky and presumptuous parasite we call a critique.  Julius Evola, The Bow and the Club Baron Giulio Cesare Evola Show me more venal, more insensitive, more corrupt minds than those of the literate caste How many of them do you know whose virtue would still be uncorrupted Who, but them, for over thirty years, kept flooding us with a loosened morale, a disdain for work, a disgust of duty, a disrespect for family, who but the literary Who dipped into secret funds more shamelessly than they did Who seduced women, softened the young, excited the nation to more debauchery than they did Who did abandon cowardly the princes after begging for their favours Socalled men of letters, always They run like harlots between the legitimate government and usurpers, between monarchy and republic, between politics and socialism, between atheism and religion. Everything is good to them as long as they can make a profit and be fashionable out of it.  PierreJoseph Proudhon quoted by the following one PierreJoseph Proudon Compare, for example, seventeenth century writers with those of the eighteenth. What a difference in tone and gait The former, under a veneer of servility, have the most noble and proud stance They do not pretend to reign. They merely stand at their place, recognize the place of a superior power beyond, give themselves completely to their writing task, dismiss the temptation of advertising and demonstrate their professional dedication. On the other hand, look at the Voltaire, Diderot and the like they open well the era of intellectuals, writing stooges as they are, courtiers of princes they flatter and despise at the same timesomething they are forced to do as they want to usurp their power Their courtier nature reveals in everything they do The whole eighteenth century, both spiritual and plain on a scoundrel background, is libertine, and already pornographic such is the start of literary mercantilism people of letters make money out of their writings, pretend to financial independence, and they write garbage to flatter the opinion of their public.  douard Berth, Les mfaits des intellectuels the misdeeds of the intellectuals, Introduction douard Berth disciple of Proudhon I have had the same experience with journalists citing each other about my books without the smallest effort to go to my writingsmy experience is that most journalists, professional academics, and other in similar phony professions dont read original sources, but each other, largely because they need to figure out the consensus before making a pronouncement.

"The celebrations have ended and weve all come to absorb the fact that Donald Trump is our next President, an outcome that many of us have aggressively worked for in the past several months. Now that weve gotten what we wanted, its time to describe exactly how a Trump presidency will improve our standing.If the President can say it then you can say it The biggest effect well see is the death of political correctness. We now have a shitlord for President who has insulted ugly women as fat pigs, and whose private macho talk, which all masculine men have done, was relentlessly attacked by the press but not punished in the voter booth. This means that when you talk like Trump, the first thought your listener will have is, He sounds like the President of the United States.What excuse will they now have for limiting your speech if one man was able to gain the highest office in the land because of it Either Trump was elected because voters liked a person who makes those kinds of statements or they didnt care enough that he made them. Whichever explanation you accept means that the will of the American people has stated that you can exercise your free speech, your opinions, and your desire to flirt with attractive women without having to obey a speech police force that evaluates everything you do based on how offensive it is to a kaleidoscope of races and loony identities. You can begin removing your politically correct filter.Im in a state of exuberance that we now have a President who rates women on a 110 scale in the same way that we do and evaluates women by their appearance and feminine attitude. We may have to institute a new feature called Would Trump bang to signify the importance of feminine beauty ideals that cultivate effort and class above sloth and vulgarity. Simply look at his wife and the beautiful women he has surrounded himself with to remind yourself of what men everywhere prefer, and not the beauty at every size sewage that has been pushed down our throats by gender studies professors and corporations trying to market their product to feminist fatsoes . The President of the United States does not see the value in fat women who dont take care of themselves, and neither should you.Liberals will be forced to tolerate us in a way they didnt have to before There are so many of us that we can ease out of the closet and not be afraid of persecution like before. What are they going to do, fire everyone who supports Trump Accuse every man who voted for him of rape The way the establishment has been able to marginalize us is to corner men individually and apply intense pressure, but now we have natural allies in all men who back Trump, even if they dont subscribe to our particular interpretation of masculinity .Liberals will not be able to point and shriek to get you to withdraw like before. They will not have easy victories by using labels like racist or sexist. They will have to endure us in their midst and bite their lip when we offend their degenerate ideals, knowing that the price of attacking us is becoming too costly. It may be as simple as whipping out your MAGA hat, as if its a bat signal, and having fellow Trump supporters come to your aid. I know that if I see a Trump supporter in trouble, I will help him, regardless of his race or station. Liberals will be forced to share space with those whom they hate, instead of trying to exile them like in the past.It will be easier to find a fellow traveler Men who hold our beliefs have long ago learned that we cant go around sharing them in public to those who are not vetted. If youre like me, you first test a new man you meet with a masculine comment to see how he responds, such as remarking on the attractiveness of a woman or how youve heard of a community online that trolls liberals without mercy. Weve even had to devise a special pet shop code to know if a man is aware of the teachings that are found on ROK or the forum . We now have a easier shortcut in Trump.If a man tells you that he voted for Trump, its safe to say that he is favorable to strong borders, nationalism , masculinity, and beautiful women. On a basic level, you will be able to get along with this man and build a bond. It also works the other way around where you bring up Trump to screen out those who are offended by him. Its fine if someone is politically indifferent, but if a man opposes Trump then I have to anticipate him attacking or sabotaging me in the future. I will distance myself from him for my own wellbeing.The cultural decline will halt We now have a President who will not encourage antimale propaganda, rape culture, and female victimhood. While I do have minor concerns on the influence of his feministminded daughter, Ivanka, Trump will not continue the attack on men that has been institutionalized since the sexual revolution and accelerated during the eight years of Obama. Because our current cultural dystopia is the result of intense longterm manipulation, it is more than enough for Trump to simply not touch the gender issue to allow the culture to return to a more patriarchal order. Stop feeding the rot and it will die off, allowing biology to naturally reassert itself.Weve experienced so many changes in the past decade that we havent had a chance to understand whats going on and adapt. Instead, weve been reacting from one blow to the next, whether its the loss of our jobs through witch hunts or the rape culture horror that has turned a banal consensual hookup into possible incarceration. Trumps victory gives us room to begin pushing back against the fictions that have put men in harms way.Conclusion Paradoxically, the benefits of a Trump presidency will not involve specific actions from Trump. His presence automatically legitimizes masculine behaviors that were previously labeled sexist and misogynist. While we may still get heat for them, it will be less severe and well be less likely to sustain serious damage. Liberals will have no choice but to silently stew on our words and we can more effortlessly connect with men not only for male bonding but also to push back against a demoralized and fractured left. Victories will be far easier to achieve under Trump than Obama.This is our moment. The door is opening for a renaissance of masculinity where men can take pride in being men, and the best part of it is that we dont need to wait for Trump to do anything. His victory is more than enough for us to apply our own individual strength in seizing the bulls horns where we can come out of the politically incorrect closet and assert our beliefs and behaviors. It would be icing on the cake if Trump rolled back antimasculine laws and policies, but its not required, because the power to change ourselves and our country is within our hands. Return Of Kings opened in 2012, and the only surprise for me is how quickly the name is being fulfilled.Read Next If Donald Trump Doesnt Win, Were Screwed ",hate
"  Two More Hollywood Films For Men That Leave Todays SJW Movies In The Dust Two More Hollywood Films For Men That Leave Todays SJW Movies In The Dust Bob Smith Bob Smith is a man in search of the truth. His favorite quotes are, Were all fools on this earth, and I can be no different I know its true, I read it at the LIEbrary and The truth is not misogynistic, its just the truth. November 11, 2016 Culture Today we are going to take a quick look at two epic Clint Eastwood films, one of which is a wellknown, Western classic  The Outlaw Josey Wales . The other one is a littleknown, undertheradar gem, which showcases the psychotic insanity of the deranged Western female  Play Misty for Me . Both of these superb RPO films will leave any redpill male feeling wholly satisfied, shortly after viewing them, and, well, thats what these movie reviews of your old Uncle Bobs are all about, are they nothelping you find the bona fide gold nuggets amid the endlessly steaming piles of SJW Hollywood crap Yes indeed. So lets get crackin. 1. The Outlaw Josey Wales 1976  Clint Eastwood, Chief Dan George, Bill McKinney, John Vernon Clint Eastwood directed and starred in this sweeping, extremely wellcrafted, postCivil War epic film, and the cinematography and direction are undeniably excellent. But Eastwoods portrayal of the Southernsympathizer, Josey Wales, who has a major score to settle after Union troops burn his house down and murder his wife and children, is in itself a major cinematic achievement. Out for blood and taking no prisoners, Eastwoods merciless Josey Wales thunders across the plains and prairies of the American West, blowing scores of Northern soldiers away in the process, as he makes a desperate dash towards Mexico, and what he hopes will be sanctuary. But Wales gets sidetracked along the way, collecting a stray dog and a few stray human beings as well, which proves that the only thing a man can truly count on in this life is change. Theres a great scene early on in the film, involving Josey Wales partner in crime, Jaimie played by Sam Bottoms, where he starts babbling incoherently, while faking a state of feverinduced delirium from underneath a blanket, as the two outlaws are confronted by a pair of backwoods yahoos who are looking to collect the bounty that has recently been placed on Wales head. Here, we clearly see the behavior of the typical, frightened, woefully outmanned beta male, as character actor Len Lesser who portrays the overmatched bounty hunter Abe starts yapping and barking in a very loud voice, while jerking around excitedly, shortly after getting the drop on Eastwoods alphamale killingmachine. If youre an alpha male and youre in good shape, youve undoubtedly seen similar betamale behavior. Probably at a bar, when some paunchy beta asswit, whos sitting with his cucked crew, has had one too many beers and starts cutting you down in a passiveaggressive manner, from your periphery, as he barks and yaps in an excited voice about how tough he used to be, or how he doesnt need to lift weights to be a man, or how he doesnt think its cool to wear tight shorts a hostile barb born of envy, uttered because he feels his package is inadequate. Yup, you know the routine. In the films wowwealmosthadagangbang scene, featuring a somewhatturnedon Sondra Locke see above photo Locke portrays Kansasborn settler, Laura Lee, as shes confronted in the back of a covered wagon and dragged outside by a group of lusty Comancheros, which was obviously a blatant exaggeration, because, as we already know, all rapes are committed by totally unattractive, deranged, horribly evil, lightskinned men who smell badly and have absolutely zero neck tattoos E ,  etc.Clints character comes riding to the rescue out of the hills and guns the wouldbe rapists down, which probably made SJWs and feminists at the time scream with unbridled outrage at the theater screen, She was giving her consent  Didnt you see it  It was in her eyes  Its her right to express herself sexually, with however many men she might choose  Murderer Creeper Pussyblocker  Unfortunately, just like today, there were feminists and SJWs aplenty back in 1976. Their numbers have been growing with a vengeance since roughly the mid1960s, and after more than 50 years in the saddle, they still keep going round and round in circles, yelling preprogrammed buzzwords and catchphrases, while unknowingly speeding up the destruction of freedom of speech, but hey, Uncle Bob, tell us something we dont already know, and yeah, Ill get back to the film review now. My favorite scene in the movie occurs when Josey Wales who, now that I think about it, is a bit of a white knight, hmm, rescues a Native American woman who is about to be doubleteamed against her will by a pair of drunken white trappers. Eastwoods maddog character ultimately gets the drop on the wouldbe bountycollectors, and he blows them straight to hell in an impressive hail of gunfire, which, Ill have to admit, is pretty darned cool in itself. I mean, thats why we watch films like this, isnt it  for the violence, and the babes, and the redpill messages Well, there are plenty of those to be had in this noholdsbarred, epic Western film. Maybe Im going to have to rethink this movie in terms of it being perceived as a wholly redpill film. Clints character stepped up and stopped a potential gangbang, as well as a threeway, and nobody asked him to do it. So this might have been a sly, Hollywood warmup for the series of blatant white knight films we see today, but I dont really want to think that way about Clint, so I wont. Ill just gulp down a quick blue pill right nowah, much better. I mean, Clint played Dirty Harry Callahan, for chrissakes, in a film that I will hopefully be reviewing at a later date, if I dont get hit by a truck driven by an illegal alien whos sporting 20 arrests for murder while having no drivers license or lynched by a swarm of rabid SJWs who are on the hunt for any white male who isnt a media CEO or a billionaire. The film bogs down a bit after about the twothirds mark, in my opinion, but it still gets high marks across the board in every other critical category. If you havent seen it, rectify that soon. You cant miss by watching this topdrawer, RPO film for men. 2. Play Misty for Me 1971  Clint Eastwood, Jessica Walter, Donna Mills Unless they are overthetop, laughingly ridiculous, obviously fictional slasher films, redpill movies like this one just dont get made in Hollywood any longer. When you think of Clint Eastwood, you usually think of Dirty Harry , or The Outlaw Josey Wales , or Unforgiven , or Gran Torino, but Clint made a few obscure films that were both solidly red pill, and truly excellent movies, although theyve been swept under the rug and locked away in the film vaults by todays liberalleaning filmhiders. In this welldirected, highly suspenseful thriller, Carmelbythesea disk jockey, Dave Carver Clint Eastwood lives a freewheeling, alpha male lifestyle, regularly banging out an assortment of hot women who listen to his live jazz broadcasts on a nightly basis. Carver is living the dream, pounding most of the available hot babes, and thoroughly enjoying his rightfully appointed alpha male privilege or is that white male privilegeerSJW moment there, sorry. That is, until Jessica Walters psychostalker character, Evelyn, walks into his life. Now, you may have encountered a few of these yourself. Or maybe its just me. Sometimes I think I have an invisible sign on my forehead that only the initiated can read, which proclaims, If youre hot and insaneIm your guy. But Clint Eastwood shows us exactly what its like to be pursed by an attractive, psycho, female stalker. From writing creepy notes to him in lipstick on his mirror, to cutting up his clothing, to attacking his cleaning lady in a fit of jealous rage, Clints diskjockey character quickly begins to realize that he bit off a hell of a lot more than just pussy when he started banging actress Jessica Walters batshitcrazy Evelyn. Ive always had a feeling that actresses who were really good in these psycho roles, were just being themselves. But I could be wrong about that. I was wrong once beforeit was in the third grade and she didnt really love me. Be that as it may, Jessica Walters really brings her Agame in the role of the totally unhinged Evelyn. If youve ever had a relationship with a woman like this one, watching the film will send chills down your spine, and result in some serious flashback imagery. Have you ever done thiswhat Clint is doing in the above photonamely, hold and comfort a crazy woman who somehow managed to weasel her way into your life, by skillfully turning you into both an enabler and a caretakerif so, I definitely feel your pain. And Ill bet Clint has experienced it a time or three himself, or he probably wouldnt have done this film. Play Misty for Me is absolutely worth watching for myriad reasons but the most important reason of all, I wholeheartedly believe, is because it will clearly demonstrate to you, in no uncertain terms, the subtle and overt signs that a man absolutely has to be able to recognize, in order to avoid being blindsided by a psychotic, unhinged female. And for that reason alone, its a mustsee classic, no doubt about it when Clints character ultimately gets revenge on his tormentor, at the very end of this excellent RPO film, youll feel all warm and fuzzy inside, tooand in a weird, viscerally satisfying waywhich makes the whole experience just that much more gratifying. By boycotting all modern SJW Hollywood cinema, you are sending a message to the power structure that is loud and clearyou are not being fooled by their deliberate attempts to poison peoples minds and socially engineer them to be pussified, dumbeddown, bluepillsucking robots. Always research the plot lines of any films for which you are seriously considering buying a ticket, or renting on DVD. And if you smell an SJW rat, dont spend your money. Its that simple. In the end, its just like investigating a potential LTR candidate. You have to conduct your due diligence. Otherwise, you might just get taken for a ride.",hate
"Home This Month Popular What The Trump Skeptics Got Wrong What The Trump Skeptics Got Wrong FitzRoy Sommerset FitzRoy is a British and American Nationalist who refuses to apologize for the British Empire. As a young man, he took a Presidents shilling and served in the U.S. Army. In his free time, he enjoys studying history and destroying the SJW revisionist narrative. November 12, 2016 Politics There have been few true upsets in our history Caesar crossing the Rubicon, Wellingtons victories at Assaye and Waterloo, and Washingtons victory at Yorktown over the most professional army in the world. It is often said that when General Charles OHara who had the dubious distinction of surrendering to both George Washington and Napoleon Bonaparte surrendered Cornwalliss sword, the band played The World Turned Upside Down. Today, the establishment and the intellectuals cannot help but share a similar sentiment as Cornwallis or OHara did at Yorktown. And I fully admit In spite of my vote for Trump, I fully expected him to lose. The polls, his 60 negative approval rating, and the sheer forces of the media, the FBI and even some Republicans were arrayed against him. My skepticism of Trump was not his ideas, but his chances of winning the election. Myself, and other conservative intellectual skeptics who voted for him, were wrong. I am one of the intellectuals who expected a Trump defeat. Ive been studying politics, history and economics for years, reading countless books on the matter from The Prince to Freakonomics to The Wealth of Nations. And I was wrong. It was a Canadian housewife and an Iranian pickup artist who called it correctly for Trump. Trump beat the odds, he beat the intellectuals, and made the establishment babies in the hands of a giant as was said after Napoleons resounding victory at Austerlitz in 1806. The left is currently in panicmode in an attempt to explain how they lost. They are calling Trump supporters racist, sexists, homophobic and even sex offenders But in the end, it was this same blindness that made them psychologically incapable of defeating Donald Trump. Trump was immune to almost all conventional political weapons. Trump won because of the following 1. The left seemed far more interested in calling Trump and his supporters racist than saying something of substance. 2. Outlets such as the New York Times did blatantly stupid crap like try to blame the NRA for the Orlando Shootings, and even tried to call them terrorists. In this, they beat even Trump in outrageousness they thought the American people were stupid, so they just lied to them and said fuck it, those peasants will believe anything we write. 3. All Trump had to do was call them on their bullshit, and call them liars. And he was 100 right the MSM has lied to the American people this entire election cycle. Subsequent to every terrorist attack perpetrated by a Muslim, the MSM continued to push the narrative that home grown rightwing terrorism is the real problem. Trump called them on their lies, and the American people, who are tired of being lied to by the MSM, cheered him on, even if he had a few issues with the truth himself. 4. The Democrats ran the absolute worst candidate possible. Hillary Clinton had negative approval ratings that rivaled Trumps own. And she was bland. And she couldnt decide if she was a moderate or a firebrand progressive. And she is corrupt, and lied about it, stupidly thinking the American people were too ignorant to understand that putting classified information on a private email server is a recklessly irresponsible thing to do. 5. Trump knew how to communicate with people. He knew that whites without a college degree were tired of being talked down to by progressives on the left and genuine intellectuals on the right like myself. I freely admit I am guilty of this when you study two thousand years of philosophy, economics and rhetoric Cicero was particularly effective, it is sometimes frustrating when people dont approach a situation in terms of axioms and proofs. The working class that built America go by what they feel in their gut, and often times, they are right. All in all, the left failed because they failed to understand America. They bought into the idea that Americans are stupidhaha Americans are not stupid they may not be smart, but they sure as hell know when a liberal taking head is lying to them about now the NRA is basically the Taliban in an obviously biased hit piece. Hillary took working class Americans for granted, and she lost. This should stand as a parallel for black Americans whom the Democrats also take for granted. I am pleased that Donald Trump is now PresidentElect. He wasnt just a candidate, he was the anticandidate. He did everything a politician should not do. He used vulgar language. He talked freely about his ideas. He made no pretense about being polite to those who are destroying America. He turned weaknesses such as his spotty track record into strengths that would have ended any other candidates campaign. He was the uncandidate America needed. I have high hopes for Trumps presidency. In spite of my tepid support, I see Trump as a President who can do a lot of good, and has the potential to do more good than any President of recent memory. First, Trump spat in the face of PC culture and won. Just as Scott Walker took on the Unions in Wisconsin and cucked them by winning the recall election by getting more votes than he did in the previous election, Trump defeated the SJWs. If Trump can keep this up, we can achieve a major strategic victory in the war against political correctness, and get back to a concept called actually being correct. Secondly, Trump is an unapologetic nationalist. He loves America, and doesnt give a damn if you think Howard Zinns A Peoples History of the United States is a great book. The Department of Cultural Guilt that has infected schools in America teaches children to hate their own country. I look forward to seeing Trump abolish the practice of teaching children that the Founding Fathers were evil racists, the British Empire did nothing good for the world, and that America is the greatest evil the world has ever seen. Lastly, Trump is the antithesis of everything the Social Justice Warriors stand for a successful alpha male who tells people to go fuck themselves and still gets elected. I hope to see a rise in masculinity in America studies have shown that testosterone levels are down among the American male population. This should rise under Trump, as men embrace their masculinity instead of hiding it for fear of being accused of sexual assault. I was a Trump skeptic. I underestimated him. I didnt disagree with him on much perhaps maybe 20 of his platform, but I had little faith he could pull it off. And I was vocal about my concerns regarding his electability. But like the liberals, I was wrong. And a Canadian housewife and a former pickupartistturnedconservativephilosopher were 100 right. I recall something I told a fellow soldier while on a long, boring convoy operation in Iraq When a genius says something, others say wow, that is way above my head. But when a true genius says something, others say wow, why didnt I think of that before Trump is a true genius he stated the obvious to the American people and made them believe he wanted to Make America Great Again and I think he genuinely does. He didnt use fancy graphs or focus groups he spoke the truth, without political correctness. And now he is PresidentElect.",hate
"Home This Month Popular Why Its Absolutely Worth It To Learn Game Why Its Absolutely Worth It To Learn Game Jon enjoys helping others evolve into their best selves on his blog Masculine Development and recently launched his eBook on 7 Strategies to Develop Your Masculinity. November 12, 2016 Game After my previous article , which advocated that men learn game as a form of selfdevelopment, I got a good amount of disagreementmost of it was not inaccurate. The majority of ROK readers are becoming less and less interested in learning game, simply because Western women are not as attractive as they once were. This isnt to say that weve abandoned learning game as a whole certainly we still want to get laid and eventually find a girl for a relationship. But, nonetheless, there seems to be a large portion of the manosphere which simply doesnt believe that game is worth it anymore. In this article, I would like to present a very realistic and objective perspective in regards to learning game. In retrospect, my last article may have been too focused on the positive aspects I do not wear the rose colored glasses in regards to the game. In fact, its quite the opposite. As a veteran myself, Im quite aware of the troubles that men can encounter when learning game. Ive been slapped for making mildly offensive jokes, Ive had drinks thrown on me, Ive had guys threaten to slit my throat, and more. Despite this, however, I still believe that it is 100 worth it to learn game. Beginners Hell HOW DARE YOU TRY TO ASK ME MY NAME YOU FUCKING RAPIST I believe that the reason why most men dont feel that game is worth it, is because they experience difficulty getting over a period known as beginners hell. This is when youre just starting to shrug off your feminist conditioning , and you havent developed the confidence or game that you need to succeed. Most beginners walk around, not really knowing how to talk to women , how to carry themselves, or how to flirt in general. Because of this, women will typically have one of two responses They pity you and ignore you They lash out and berate you for being a creep, or weird. Of course, you may get the occasional girl whos drunk enough to be into you, but these are few and far between. For the most part, the Beginners Hell, phase of learning game is absolutely horrendous. You will be sometimes be targeted by club douchebags, who will either confront you or use their superior social intelligence to embarrass you, and on the rare occasion that you do manage to get a girl talking to you, hell come over and steal her. You will have women smack you, ignore you, and tell you offagain, its called beginners hell, for a reason. 6s Who Think Theyre 10s This initial difficulty in learning game is only compounded by our cultures general lack of femininity. It is extremely obvious, to anyone with eyes to see, that women in our culture are encouraged to be less and less feminine as time goes on. The once praised virtues of nurturing, empathy, and kindness, have now been replaced by resting bitch face, sociopathy, and social climbing. This coupled with the fact that women experience an endless supply of beta orbiters, means that theyve been conditioned to believe theyre highly sought after goddesses, who can use men like tissues without any sort of social repercussions and in fact, theyre sometimes praised for doing so. This is, perhaps, one of the biggest obstacles to newbies struggling to learn game. Couple this with severe approach anxiety, a complete lack of masculinity, and a weak body that hasnt been trained, and its very easy to see why most men dont see that game is worth it. The Turning Point Once one gets beyond this initial bump, however, most of game is smooth sailing. Once the newbie has learned how to fix his lack of masculinity, how to balance assertiveness with consent , and has improved his game in general, he enters what I call the turning point. The turning point is essentially that point at which learning game is no longer a struggle, but its actually enjoyable. This is due to several key lifestyle and mindset shifts which take place as the newbie gets more and more success, such as Drawing state from within, rather than from without Being in a state of abundance, rather than scarcity Improving other areas of your life, which creates an upwards spiral If youre a newbie struggling to learn game, and you dont feel like its worth it, I fully empathize with your painthe problem is that when you dont have much game, of course learning game will be hard, because you get stuck with the bitchy fat girls. When you start to develop the three characteristics that I mentioned, however, a cascade of effects starts to take place that catapults your game to the next level. This allows you to pick and choose which hot girls you want, rather than being at the mercy of the ugly 5 who might want to come over and hang out. Internal vs. External Drawing Of State By my age, you realize that bitches aint shit, but hoes and tricks. The transition from drawing state from outside of you, to drawing state from within you, is literally the difference between a guy that doesnt pull at all, and a guy that can pull Victorias Secret models. Let me explain women typically draw state from without. This means that their emotions are governed by their environment. This is why they respond so much more to social pressure than men, why they just want to dance, when a song they like comes on, and its why theyre generally so emotionally volatile. Due to their changing environments, their emotions change rapidly as well. This is why they want men to draw state from within, or in other words, not be affected by their outside environments. This is why women are repulsed by men who care too much about their opinions its indicative of a man who draws state from without. As a man, drawing state from within has numerous benefits, the most obvious of which being that youre perpetually in a good mood. Once you learn to make this shift, and learn to be happy regardless of your external circumstances, women will pick up on it like a hawktheyre very attuned to this type of thing, and youll definitely notice a difference in their behavior. This will get them vying for YOUR attention, which will start to give you tremendous power. This will make game fun, which will lead to even more women in your life, which will begin the start of your upward spiral. The Beginning Of The Upward Spiral Once you begin to make this simple mindset shift, game will no longer feel like its not worth it. You see, game feels like its not worth it when you have to put in a huge amount of effort for a below average looking girl, with a horrible personality. But, when you start to get to the point where you can put in a medium amount of effort, for a very gorgeous woman Thats when game starts to be fun. This basic mindset shift of learning to not care what your environment is like, and to simply be happy by yourself, will create a chain reaction within your life. First, youll start to get much more women much more easily. This will allow you to start a harem, which will keep you in a perpetual state of abundance until you find a girl you want for a relationship. This state of abundance will amplify your game by about five fold. Women will sense that youve got a ton of other women vying for your attention, and they will do the sameits like a magnet that just draws them in. Plus, if a girl does or says something that you dislike, you can simply kick her out of your life since you have so many other women. Then, when you start to have so many women in your life, youll start to friend zone hot girls for the social benefits , because you simply cant handle sleeping with all of them. Theyll invite you to parties, and try to hook you up with their friends, and youll receive many of the social benefits that they do. Game Is Worth It It Just Sucks At First Getting over beginners hell is a lot like this. Once you get to the other side, its all downhill, though. As I have made clear, learning game at first is a huge struggleyou will encounter massive cock blocks, a lot of negativity from women, and not to mention youll have to deal with all of the white knights, too. But, if you can learn to get over this initial Beginners Hell, as Ive coined it, you will see the other side of reality that most men are shielded from. I realize that it can be very difficult to learn game at first, and can feel like it isnt worth it, but if you make a decision to put in the effort and learn it, your world will literally be 1000x better than before. If youre struggling with learning game initially, be sure to maximize your appearance. Get some height increasing soles, read through some of the style articles on ROK, get a good designer haircut, and learn to perfect your appearance, at least as much as you can. Consider taking some martial arts classes to boost your confidence, as well. Ultimately, however, if you want to learn game and experience what its like to have dozens of hot girls hitting you up, you just have to bite the bullet and go out. Go clubbing, go to bars, go on trips to Las Vegas or Miami. Approach women during the day and approach them during the nighteventually youll get over this Beginners Hell, and will experience an abundance of women in your life.",hate
"  Buzz Aldrin Is A Warning Of How Success Can Lead To Depression Buzz Aldrin Is A Warning Of How Success Can Lead To Depression Aaron Clarey Captain Capitalism is the resident economist of the mano/androsphere. He is a misanthropic, hedonist, nihilistic, cynical type, but he keeps getting proved right every day. He is the author of  Enjoy the Decline ,  Worthless , and  Bachelor Pad Economics . His newest book is  The Black Mans Guide Out Of Poverty . He also runs the advisory  Asshole Consulting . You can read his daily rantings at his blog Captain Capitalism . November 13, 2016 Masculinity Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong are household names because they were the first men to land on the moon. And while Neil is perhaps the moreremembered of the two because he was technically the first to land on the moon, Buzz is just as remembered because of his unique name while I bet most of you dont know who the third guy was. But technicalities of who landed where first and who had cool names aside, Buzz Aldrin will forever be one of the worlds greatest historical figures because of his unrivaled accomplishments and will die a better man than the vast majority of us. But did you know Buzz Aldrin was an alcoholic And after retiring he fell into a severe depression And after his divorce his days consisted of drinking alone in his apartment, fetching KFC and booze until he entered rehab Its a hard fact to believe. Where a man who seems to have everything fame, a superaccomplished career, and least of all, the titaniumstrong professionalism and selfdiscipline to become an astronaut, yet he ends up down, depressed, drunk, and perhaps even suicidal like any other ordinary piece of trailer trash. But while it doesnt make sense at first, and you cant see how this relates to you, realize theres a VERY good and simple reason for this fall from great heights. The Buzz Aldrin Syndrome Understand as we use the internet to accumulate the wisdom and knowledge to rocket past our contemporaries and excel in life, a problem is festering that you are unaware of. Additionally, much like Alzheimers, it is not prevalent today, but as humans advance more and live longer, it will become increasingly common. Therefore, we have the option to identify it today, prepare for it now, and thus avoid the pain and insanity that comes with having a problem we cant identify or we can have it devastate our lives later. It is the Buzz Aldrin Syndrome. The Buzz Aldrin Syndrome is where a man achieves such greatness, such accomplishments in life, that he is truly unrivaled and peerless. While exhilarating at first, perhaps even earning one fame, riches, and fortune, the success also unintentionally alienates the person from the rest of society. At the time Buzz Aldrin only had three or four other astronauts who he could REALLY talk to, confide in, and relate to. The remaining 3 billion people on the planet at the time were just starstruck, wideeyed sheep. Alas, Buzz Aldrin could be surrounded by scores of fans at a party, but still be completely alone mentally. The syndrome is also exacerbated as ones pinnacle achievements in life are likely correlated with retirement. You typically progress in your career, right up until the day you retire. However, here you leave the environment and network youve come accustomed, thrived in, and derived your entire agency from. Thus, in a very short period of time you go from the center of attention, the life of the party, the engine of the machineto a retiree in California, drinking scotch, and eating KFC, longing for the days you could go back to the office again. Without the environment you derived all your worth and value from, you lose purpose in life, you lose mental stimulation, you lose your peers, and very likely sink into a crippling depression. The Perfect Storm There are seven factors that, when combined, create the perfect storm for the Buzz Aldrin Syndrome to form. And most ROK readers either have these traits are affected by them 1. Technological Advancements Technology has always advanced, but in this particular case it affects us in two specific ways. Making living expenses cheaper and allowing for more and easier ways to make money. As opposed to the 1800s, most of a mans life was spent toiling in the field. He didnt have time to contemplate loftier or heavier subjects much like the purpose of life, what is mans reason for being, etc. You had to worry about the plague, tetanus, your wife dying in labor, and whether thered be enough crops to survive the coming winter. But today, through economics, capitalism, agricultural technology, etc., a single man can basically eat for nearfree at WalMart or the local grocery store. Technology has also freed us from work. Not so much from the fact we have to work, but in terms of how much time we need to spend on it in order to survive. No more than a decade ago a young man had to work 40 hours a week, 10 for a commute, and likely for an inept baby boomer boss who was never going to let you get past the cubicle plantation. Now, with the internet not only can a man give the proverbial finger to rush hour and a commute, but his boss as well, making whatever minimalistic modicum of money he needs to survive through online entrepreneurship. In short, it has never been easier to satisfy Maslows first three and vital hierarchy of needs, freeing a mans mind to pursue his own excellence, not to mention ponder his point and purpose in being here. 2. Minimalism It is no secret that red pill men practice, or at least pursue minimalism. We know that material things do not matter, as it is the love and friendship from our fellow man, friends, family and loved ones that matter most. You know that it would be nice to have that Shelby Super Snake Mustang, but youd never trade it in for a lifetime of conversations and cigars with your best friend. Additionally, we value our freedom above all else and refuse to subjugate ourselves to becoming debt slaves by buying things we plain dont need. Jettisoning these material desires liberates more of our finite lives from work and a commute, to once again pursue our passions, our fields, our adventures, and our lives. In simply refusing to buy a McMansion and take on a car loan, we guarantee we will live more interesting and rewarding lives than 90 of our peers. 3. Avoiding Divorce And Unwanted Children Further saving us more time is the disproportionate number of us refusing to have children or marry in fear of divorce. And for those of us who do marry, we are fully aware of what to look for, more or less immunizing us from divorce. 4. Knowledge of Women To be blunt and honestly assess the good the manosphere and red pill community have done, we have saved the lives of MILLIONS of young men, and prevented older ones from wasting what remains of theirs. If I were to estimate it, every boy born today will save at least a decade of time that would have otherwise been wasted at nightclubs, chasing tail, dating the wrong girls, and perhaps even marrying the wrong ones. Being a product of the 70s, I have often talked with my Gen X peers where we estimated what we could have done had we not wasted the 80s and 90s chasing women we were either never going to get, or would regret catching. We could have easily had doctorates, houses built by our own hands, much better careers, not to mention better mental health as we would have avoided all the batshit insane women we sifted through. Young men today, especially those who consume the Red Pill, will easily have a decade of time on us by simply learning from our mistakes . 5. SelfImprovement Unless you are in the VirginTOW community, you know how important selfimprovement is to a mans life. You have this one finite life on this planet, and not only is it imperative you enjoy it, but you must ensure it is a masterpiece of art in whatever endeavors you choose to excel in. This may not land you on the moon, but you will achieve greatness and excellence in some capacity or another. Music, literature, innovation, philosophy, being a good dad, something. You will not idly stand by, sitting on your ass, majoring in sociology, or collecting a welfare check as you knock up baby mama after baby momma. You will be notable and leave a positive legacy on this world. 6. Entrepreneurship or STEM Most of you know not to major in stupid, worthless shit . You also know that for the majority of us, entrepreneurship or selfemployment is the only form of employment that we can tolerate. Because of this, two things will happen in your life. One, you will save an inordinate amount of time spent trying to make a go at a career that just isnt in demand in the real world. You will work as an engineer, a programmer, a doctor, or some REAL profession/trade, which will not only pay you a handsome wage, but make your life incredibly easier. Two, at some point in time you will come up with an idea that will either cement your success in your career or outright launch a successful entrepreneurial endeavor. This will free you from your dependence on traditional employers, ensure your financial future is sound, but it will also likely lead towards you achieving your legacy in excellence. In the veritable sea of liberal arts majors, not one of their millions will ever make anything of themselves. They will simply waste away, doubling down on masters degrees and doctorates in their hopelessly worthless fields. Worse, they will be crippled until death with student loans and inadequate compensation as they beg and vote for other peoples money. They will die like most, unmentionable, irrelevant, and forgotten. You will not. 7. A High Intelligence To make all of this a reality you need the raw intellectual capacity to bring this to fruition. While no studies have been done, if you have the independent mindedness to be reading ROK, Id estimate the average IQ of ROK readers to be 120. However, keep in mind while being highly intelligent is an asset, it is also a curse . Like ROK, you are on the fringe. And because of that you are not only going to receive an inordinate amount of flak from the rest of normie society, but relating to the rest of it, let alone finding a healthy and rewarding social life in it, is going to prove next to impossible. When you combine these traits and conditions, you have what is arguably the perfect environment for a great life to form. You need very little to survive because you wont waste your resources on frivolous material things in life. You also have very little liabilities or responsibilities, not only because youre a minimalist, but are likely not going to marry or have children. The lions share of your time and energies can be dedicated towards achieving excellence and greatness in your life. And if youve done it right, youll be two decades ahead of your Gen X peers since you avoided worthless degrees and leapfrogged your philosophical understanding of life. You will be accomplished, you will be successful, you will have paid a fraction of the mental toll to get there, and you will indeed be an amazing man, the worlds most interesting perhaps. You have reached the so called finish line much earlier and faster than Buzz Aldrin and thats when your real problems start. You Werent Meant to Be Here Understand that while the goal of man was to secure unlimited food, resources, and security so that he may pursue an unlimited and happy life, the human mind has no experience being here. The entire existence of humankind has been struggle, suffering, fighting, and striving for such a life, but also 99.  of the time failing . And over the course of human history the human brain has had 2 million years experience and conditioning in failure, NOT success. This leads to an ironic and perhaps the most tragic instances in human experiences. A man finally gets what he wants. Wealth, health, success, excellence, legacy, everything. But upon attaining it he cant enjoy it because the human mind is not programmed to. He not only realizes this rare success doesnt result in happiness or a perpetual lifelong glee that will see him to his grave, but theres nothing left to conquer. Theres nothing left to do. The game of life is over, and like Red Dead Redemption, it gets mighty boring just riding your horse around after you conquer the game. Worse, because of the unique characteristics required to attain this excellence any man lucky enough to be this successful is in one way or another ostracized from the rest of his peers. Professionally, romantically, intellectually, some way or another, to be in that . 1 you have to be a statistical freak. Alas, you get to suffer the true symptoms of The Buzz Aldrin Syndrome. Peerlessness  While your friends are pumping out children or your colleagues are trying to get out from underneath their McMansion mortgage and impending divorce, you may be avoiding these dreaded fates, but you are also alone. No longer are these the college days where your intellectual peers in equal lifecircumstances can hang out, chat, philosophize, and in numbers that seem endless. Slowly, but surely, they will get picked off like German Messerschmitts in WWII by the forces of life and you will be left alone. Understand this has nothing to do with your pursuit of greatness or achieving excellence in life, but is outside of your control as these people fall within the bell distribution curve of averageness. They choose these lives, meaning its not the statistical freak leaving them, but them leaving the statistical freak no matter how loudly they claimed in college they were going to live life differently. And dont think that you can simply recoup your former social life by joining them by being average, putting on a sports jersey, ordering some Buffalo Wild wings, cheering on the local sportsball team. Your mind wont tolerate it. You are peerless. Get used to it. Boredom  Without people you get bored. No matter how intelligent you are, you are still human. And humans are indeed social creatures as they derive their entire life value from others, not things. But the paradox those suffering from the Buzz Aldrin Syndrome face is that while you would like to be social with people, the vast majority of people are either too common, too stupid, or just too boring, especially when compared to being by yourself. Go to that same Buffalo Wild wings to hear loud, drunk, divorced SWPL men in their 40s cheer on the local swingystick team Or read Marcus Aurelius  Go to a movie where Jason Bourne discovers another mole in the CIAagainwho set up his fatheragain.where he drives around Europe shooting the place up.again Or binge on some history podcasts  I know How about you go to a party where youll hear the same conversations from men about the sportsball game they just saw at Buffalo Wild wings, as they lament their inability to get out from underneath their mortgage, while the wives gossip about their painfully pointless governmentmakework careers while talking about how great the cake is Or road trip out west and do some hiking in the desert The larger point is not only are the VAST majority of people not intellectually stimulating enough, but good luck finding enough of them who have the freedom and finances to do anything besides hit up happy hour when wifey lets them out of the house. And then theres Frustration  Being unencumbered by the daily scourge of chores, children, finances, mortgages, and commutes, your mind will be unshackled to pursue whatever intellectual pursuits it wishes to pursue. Youll solve world problems in an afternoon that politicians are taking eons to not solve. Youll come up with some and many viable business ideas, discarding most of them because you have not the time to put them all into execution. Youll see the obvious solutions to making your friends and love ones lives infinitely better, but theyll have the horseblinders on so tight, theyll ignore your wisdom. Or youll make a great scientific discovery at work, while your boss dismisses it away and threatens to fire you for having an independent thought. It is simply the real world telling you, You dont control everything, and matter of fact, most of this world was not meant for you. Obviously, you can see where depression, alcoholism, and ennui set in. You can see where the pursuit and successful attainment of excellence in life can lead to unintentional alienation and ostracization from the rest of society. And since society is where all humans  geniuses or not, successful or not  get their value, you can see the downside to zooming past the finish line of life, especially at increasingly earlier ages as technology and minimalism permit it. The solution is in part to find quality people who can be lifelong friends, colleagues, peers, and comrades. Perhaps even get married if you find the right girl. And no matter what, keep yourself and your mind occupied. Hobbies, interests, pursuits, etc. Inactivity is death. But ultimately, what is going to best prepare you for whats coming is to simply know its coming. Nirvana and heaven are not at the other side of that finish line. An active and rewarding social life, full of close friends and loved ones are the not the reward for success. And it certainly isnt a lifelong party until you die. It is a mentallybarren landscape much like the moon, a place Buzz has been to both literally and metaphorically.",hate
"As I have repeatedly shown in my articles, I am a fan of all aspects of fitnessnot just strength and developing muscular mass, but also cardiovascular endurance and flexibility as well. You likely knew this already.You are also likely aware that I have done several articles on stretching, most recently the relax into stretch technique that I state can be used predominantly for lower body stretching such as the splits, which are and will likely always be considered the benchmark of hip and leg flexibility.But what about upper body flexibility Most people dont focus on that, and that is just as important to train as lower body flexibility namely for purposes of increased athletic performance, reduction of joint aches and pains, and, in some cases, increased strength. I have taught the readers some basic upper body stretches in the past, such as the chest stretch and the door frame stretch. But in my opinion, if youre going to do any one stretch for upper body flexibility, that would have to be the seated twist stretch.How It Works This stretch involves crossing your legs in a manner that will be discussed below, and twisting the torso while simultaneously locking your arm onto your bent knees. This stretch will hit most of your most prominent upper body musclesthe latissimus dorsi, the triceps, the deltoids, the obliques, the neck, and the pectorals.In addition to those visible muscles, the twist stretch will work the deep spinal muscles , and even the muscles of the buttocks the gluteus maximus, medius and minimus as well.Many athletes perform the twist stretch, particularly combat athletes such as wrestlers, judokas, and mixed martial artists that need great torso flexibility to escape from holds and pinfalls.Sounds like something you ought to learn, doesnt it But howAs I have happily admitted in the past, and will likely do so again, Paul Wades outstanding Convict Conditioning series has taught me this and many other exercises, and I cannot advocate Wades writing enough. More specifically, the Twist Stretch comes from Convict Conditioning 2 . The first book deals with the core calisthenic seriespushups, squats, and the like. I have already gone over these in detail. In contrast, the second book deals with static holds that develop strength and flexibility such as the LSit and todays topic.While the third book deals with explosive movements such as the back and front handsprings, that will be a topic for another time. Instead, lets go into the steps of the Twist Stretch.All of the pictures here are taken directly from the book.The Exercises The first twist stretch is the Easy twist stretch. Sit down on the floor with your feet extended. Take one foot, and put it inside the other leg, resting that foot next to the opposite knee, as shown.Now, twist your body so the opposite shoulder turns towards the raised kneed ie if the left knee is raised, turn the right shoulder, and vice versa. Keep the foot flat on the ground and the knee stationaryjust twist the torso. Allow your neck to turn as it naturally wants to turn.Then, lock your torso by placing your elbow against the opposite side of the knee, while holding your body up with the other hand.You should immediately begin to feel a stretch all around your torso.Hold the stretch for 10 seconds, for each side. When this is comfortable for you, move on.Step 2 is the simple twist stretch, which requires a little bit more flexibility. Place one foot over the other leg as shown above. Then, take the foot that is not flat on the ground, bend the leg back and touch the heel of that foot to the opposing buttock ie the right heel touches the left buttock.This foot position will be used for all twist stretches from henceforth.Now, as before, rotate your torso towards the opposite knee right shoulder to left knee, and vice versa, locking yourself by placing your elbow on the opposite side of the knee, and again supporting your body with the other hand. Hold for 10 seconds, and move on.Stretch 3 is where things become more difficult. Assume the position from Stretch #2. But this time, you will have to rotate the torso with much more force, as the goal of this stretch is to extend your arm and touch the instep of the foot that is flat on the floor. Your arm wont be able to stretch on its own and I dont advise you try, you will have to accomplish this with proper torso rotation.Stretch 4 has the difficulty increase further Get a hand towel or some other object that is about a foot long. Assume the stretching position, and rotate the torso while holding said towel. Remove the supporting hand from the floor, and flick the towel through the hole made by your raised leg obviously your hand is not extending down to your instep here. Wrapping the support hand around your back, grab the other end of the towel. This begins the stretch.Each time you stretch, you will assume this position holding the towel in two hands. You will work your hands up and down the towel, slowly bringing your hands together by gripping greater portions of the towel. Eventually, you will be able to clasp fingers, and that is the final level of the twist stretch.This process will be slow and arduousCoach Wade himself admits that it took him the better part of a year to accomplish this by moving his fingers together inch by inch. I myself am not quite at the final level yeta rough measurement shows that I have about 4 more inches of towel to go before my fingers touch, but I have certainly noticed increased mobility and flexibility already.The towel stretch can be made easier by remembering to worm both hands up the towel, not just one. Actively use both to secure deeper stretches, and you will notice progress.Doing even the easiest variations of this stretch will make you notice an immediate healing of the spine your back will deliciously crack and youll feel warm and limber afterwards. And with practicing the more advanced variants, you will make yourself more limber for whatever physical activity you engage in, ranging from dancing to getting out of submission holds.Or you could be one of millions of Americans with bad backs and hips. The choice is yours.Read More Why Its Necessary To Relax Into A Stretch ",hate
"Since we were children, we have been bombarded with propaganda that romantic love is the ultimate relationship ideal. Hollywood movies, Disney cartoons, and literary fiction all portray romantic love as an absolute necessity in any wedding union, but how much of that narrative has been a lie Is it possible that our pursuit of romantic love is actually preventing us from forming a lifelong pair bondI began to question the notion of romantic love when thinking about its emotional root. Love is a fleeting emotion, and like all emotions, it comes and goes like the clouds in the sky. Why have I been taught to select my life partner based on an emotion Im surely not encouraged to use emotion when buying a house, applying for a job, or doing my personal finances, but when it comes to choosing a human being that Im supposed to spend the rest of my life with, Im advised by the establishment narrative to use emotion for the biggest decision of them all.Another major clue that romantic love is a childish strategy for choosing mates is the fact that countries with arranged marriages, where partners are picked based on purely practical matters, have lower divorce rates that in countries where romantic love is used to select mates  1 , 2 , 3 . While there are multiple reasons for divorce in any society, it is rather coincidental that the countries most impacted by notions of romantic love happen to have the highest divorce rates .Romance was invented It turns out that your desire to use love as a precondition for marriage or pair bonding is an invented construct that had roots in destroying tradition and theistic authority. Romanticism, a movement that began in the 18th century, put romantic love at the forefront, not just for individuals but nations as well, all from a central thesis of individualism. It wanted you to take the focus away from boring old rules and traditions to focusing on how you feel .The movement came primarily from bourgeois youth, who used family money to fiddle away on idealistic writings.the Romantic Movement was nothing more than a protest against bourgeois conventions, bourgeois society and morality. To be extreme and flamboyant and unusual and violent even at the risk of becoming grotesque was the desire of every young Romantic. The Romantics were, in fact, bourgeois origins, who were trying hard to escape from their own shadows.  Source  Romantics believed that men and women ought to be guided by warm emotions rather than the cold abstract rules and rituals established by Bourgeois society.  Source They sound a lot like modern day social justice warriors , many of whom are trust fund babies that lash out against privilege and inequality to relieve the psychological pain of being wealthy without having had to earn it. Combined with the fact that SJWs also trump feelings over logic, its clear to see how romanticists were protoSJWs, whose individualistic ideas are just what the enlightenment needed to complete its destruction of tradition.Romantics redefined what relationships should be based on Prior to the romantic era, companionate love was the relationship form often described in literature and other historical writings.Passionate love is the arousaldriven emotion which often gives people extreme feelings of happiness, and can also give people feelings of anguish. Companionate love is the form which creates a steadfast bond between two people, and gives people feelings of peace. Scientists have described the stage of passionate love as being on cocaine, since during that stage the brain releases the same neurotransmitter, dopamine, as when cocaine is being used.  Source Besides Song Of Songs in the Old Testament , writers were not encouraged to muse endlessly about passionate love, and there is zero evidence it was used as the principal factor in forming new marriages, but its this passionate love that were told to strive for, of feeling like youve been swept up in an exciting whirlwind, before publishing the gory details on Buzzfeed or in a bestseller like Eat Pray Love, authored by a woman who is embarking on her second divorce .Women of the romantic era played a big part in elevating romantic love, and why wouldnt they Its much more fun to get swept up in the excitement created by noncommittal alpha male than it does to do arduous daily duties before you husband, king, and God. Women were given the chance to pick between excitement or responsibility, and we know what they have chosen.The works of the Romantic Era also differed from preceding works in that they spoke to a wider audience, partly reflecting the greater distribution of books as costs came down during the period. The Romantic period saw an increase in female authors and also female readers.  Source The modern era has doubled down on the notion of romantic love Jewish psychologist Robert Sternberg proposed the popular triangular theory of love , which is often used today as defining the love ideal. This theory has caused immense harm for stating that all three forms of love are needed in equal measure for a successful relationship.Anyone who takes an introductory psychology course, or who reads a pop psychology book, will be exposed to this theory, and walk away thinking that passion is absolutely required in a relationship. If its not there, the presumption is that the relationship is no longer consummate and far short of ideal.Believing that romantic love and passion are necessary in a marriage makes it that much easier to exit out of it, because when a woman no longer feels passion, she will walk away knowing that experts like Sternberg would agree that the relationship degraded and was no longer worth saving. And this is exactly what modern women are doing in droves. They have shown an appalling disregard for their wedding vows, especially upon realizing that they initiate 80 of divorces .Romanticism and the rise of nationalism If nationalism came out of the romantic era, and passionate love was a mistake, does that mean nationalism is also a mistakeOne of Romanticisms key ideas and most enduring legacies is the assertion of nationalism, which became a central theme of Romantic art and political philosophy. From the earliest parts of the movement, with their focus on development of national languages and folklore, and the importance of local customs and traditions, to the movements that would redraw the map of Europe and lead to calls for selfdetermination of nationalities, nationalism was one of the key vehicles of Romanticism, its role, expression and meaning. Patriotism, nationalism, revolution and armed struggle for independence also became popular themes in the arts of this period.  Source Upon closer inspection, its easy to see that the ruling agenda of today, globalism , is essentially world nationalism. Instead of loving your neighbor, and only those who share your unique traditions or race, youre supposed to love everyone in the world , because its evil to think that there are large differences between a German businessman in a Hugo Boss suit and a Tutsi villager with a lip plate the size of a grapefruit.The romantic ideal of nationalism is not Adolph Hitler, but George Soros , who insists on loving everyone in the world from the depths of your heartfelt human compassion. A nationalism based on genetics and local bonds will no doubt serve citizens better than a global nationalism where youre supposed to care for those who are nothing like you.How should men choose their life partners Its clear that using romantic love and passion as your primary standard for longterm relationships will lead to failure and maybe even personal catastrophe. Youll easily come to this conclusion by evaluating your past relationships and the mistakes youve made on women who you had intense passion for.Instead, practicality must be the order of the day. You must logically evaluate any woman you intend to be with for more than a casual relationship by weighing her values, beliefs, and sexual history. This is easier said than done because weve been so brainwashed to believe passion is important, but it simply makes the most amount of sense. Find a woman the same way you would find a new job or buy a new house, and be wary of women who picked you based more on passion than practical matters.It may sound cold to search for your wife like you would a business partner, but that is exactly what she is. The daytoday life of a family home is far more business and economics than love, and so you should come to the easy conclusion that thats what you must use to form a stable home.Understand, however, that we do not live in a traditional and patriarchal society that aids us in our search for a virtuous woman. Instead, society is encouraging women to corrupt themselves, sexually and physically, in the name of empowerment and independence, making our search exceedingly difficult. This is one of the costs we have to pay for living in the modern world. Some men will be able to overcome it, but many men wont, and will fail in their search for a woman they can create a family with.But at least we are now armed with the knowledge of what it takes to have a more successful longterm relationship. Its not romantic love or butterflies in the stomach, but a matter of practicality. Logically evaluate her past, her values, and her beliefs to make sound predictions of how shell behave in the future. From this evaluation will come a logical decision that is likely to endure, instead of relying on emotion, which changes as readily as the direction of the wind.Read More Unconditional Love From A Woman Is Impossible ",hate
"Peter the Great 16721725 was one of the pivotal figures of Russian history. His reforms were a product of his personality and his vision for what he wanted Russia to become and sometimes in history, personality matters more than those vague historical forces that professional historians like to imagine as controlling the destinies of men.Russia in his day was still halfbarbarous. To rule her he had to be an absolute monarch, and never for a moment doubted his right to be so. His personal habits say much about him he had little need for sleep, regularly working for fourteen hours or more per day. Alcohol was considered, then as now, an acceptable escape from the drudgery of rule but he knew when to limit his intake, and forbade his ministers from excessive consumption. His sexual appetites were as normal as any mans, but he showed little interest in the kind of conspicuous indulgence that characterized most of his contemporaries in western Europe.He did make a point of choosing mistresses of lowly origin, rather than from titled families he had no desire for intellectual competition in the bedroom. When Frederick II of Denmark teased him about the type of women he chose, his response was Brother, my women do not cost me much, but yours cost you thousands of crowns which might be better spent elsewhere.He chose to spend most of his time in the city that bore his name, St. Petersburg. He liked maritime affairs, and wanted to be near the sea. He disliked the atmosphere of Moscow, with its abundance of clergy and freezing winters. It was the army that first felt the effect of his modernization programs. Peter introduced conscription, a professional officer class, and defined periods of service his naval program was less effective, and most of the vessels built during his reign were not of high quality.He realized that he would never be able to make Russia into a great power unless he changed the mentality and outlook of the people. And like many rulers before and after him, he underestimated just how difficult this task would prove to be. After his death, many of his reforms were permitted to wither on the vine but at least some tentative first steps had been made that future monarchs might draw inspiration from. By imperial decree he banished beards in 1698 an exception was made for the Orthodox Patriarch this was a shocking step in a country where whiskers had become a symbol of piety and fidelity. Those who insisted on keeping them could do so by paying an incomeadjusted annual tax. We are told that some distraught peasants obsessively saved their shaved facial hair, lest they incur some disfavor from the saints.But there was method to Peters apparent madness. He understood that appearance and thought are connected, and that if a man wished to change one, he had to change the other. In 1700 Peter decreed that all royal officials had to adopt Westernstyle clothing. Trousers and cloaks were acceptable caftans or overly oriental garb was not. Like Kemal Ataturk two centuries later, he had no patience for backsliders or protesters, whom he swept aside ruthlessly. In social relations, he ended for good the traditional practice of secluding women from public intercourse with men, a habit that had probably been an inheritance from the Mongols.These reforms gained Peter some bitter enemies among the clergy. For centuries the Russian ecclesiastic establishment had held a near monopoly on education and rural social life Peters reforms threatened to erode this base, and they saw in him an implacable enemy of traditional belief. They also suspected him of having had too much contact with western Europeans, a fact thatit seemed to themmade him nearly an atheist. Peter did not help matters by openly mocking their rituals and folkways as he saw matters, it was his responsibility to bring Russia up to par with the other advanced nations of the day, and resistance from obscurantist clerics could not be tolerated.Peter solved this problem for a time by making himself the head of the Orthodox Church in 1700 when Patriarch Adrian died. He did not appoint a successor, and went one step further in 1721 by abolishing the title of patriarch altogether. In its place he formed a council of clerics that he himself would appoint with this measure, the Church effectively became an arm of the state. Ecclesiastical grumbling was audible, but Peter wisely refused to venture into disputes with the priests over religious doctrine. He cared about power, not theology.Slowly he made progress in industrialization. This frankly could only be done with dictatorial power, and to this end he reorganized the traditional Russian boyar system. In place of the old aristocracy, a new one arose that was based on military and civil function. His rule saw some success in mining and textile work when Peter died in 1725, Russia was exporting iron, and statesponsored factories made modest gains in cloth manufacture. Protective tariffs were used to shelter the new industries from suffocating foreign competition.To pay for all this, Peter unashamedly taxed everyone in his realm to the limits of their tolerance. State tax revenues rose from 1.4 million rubles in 1680 to 8.5 million in 1724. The majority of this revenue went to the military.A Russian boyarAmbitious plans existed for education, too. Peter ordered the old Slavonic alphabet used by the Church to be replaced by a new system based on Greek letters. He imported printing presses, founded institutes, and organized professional associations to spread the ideas that were current at the time in western Europe.What was the net result of all this effort The picture was a mixed one. Reformers are not usually popular, as by their very nature they are required to focus attentions in different directions. Men and horses do not appreciate new stirrups. The peasantryalready used to a harsh existencefound themselves taxed to exhaustion Moscow became filled with paupers who alternated between banditry and begging. The nobles hated him with the same ferocity as the French nobles hated Richelieu, and for the very same reason because he forced them to serve the nation rather than each other.As his unpopularity grew, Peter resorted more and more to the whip and the dungeon to implement his designs. Perhaps there was no other way. But at the very least, his example pointed the way for future authoritarian leaders who would drag Russia, kicking and screaming, into the modern era. Some of his achievements were lasting and significant, and some were not. In history, even great men must contend with the limitations of their era, and try to balance their own vision with the possibilities granted them by circumstance. It is on this precarious tightrope that all great men walk.Read More  4 More Countries To Emigrate To If The West Collapses ",hate

"The media doesnt even try to hide its shameless proSocialist bias these days. Since nobody really pays attention to them anymore, you might have missed some of the more entertaining butthurt spouted by shameless propagandists posing as journalists.2016 election night coverage on the propaganda news channels is a lesson in hilarity when examining the reaction of lamestream media talking heads. What is most entertaining about Trumps ascendancy to the Oval Office is that it was totally unexpected, catching cocksure Marxists at CNN and other alphabet channels completely off guard.Lets go over some of the more entertaining reactions last Tuesday.5. Hillary Shill Martha Raddatz Breaks Down In Tears Over at ABC, the wrinkled old Hillary shill Martha Raddatz was at a loss for words as she attempted to perform an off the cuff hamster rationalization to fellow Clinton operative George Staphylococcus, explaining why The Bitch lost the election.Raddatz looked like her mother just died as victory turned into defeat for the criminal Hillary Clinton. Shes sure to be moving from a pack of smokes a day to two packs a day as the reality of the election continues to settle into her pea brain over the next 4 years. Her tears say more than her boilerplate language ever could.4. Bernstein Plays The Race Card To the mainstream media, white people voting in accordance with their own selfinterest is racist. In fact, white people acting in any other manner than total subservience is racist to CNN. Washington Post journalist Carl Bernstein even went so far as to say Trumps election is tragic and dangerous as despondent and quite possibly drugged CNN propagandists looked on. Bernstein seemed most upset about Trumps immigration policy proposals, in which Mexico will no longer be able to flagrantly let its citizens violate U.S. immigration law.Bernstein completely forgot the racism white people have endured all year long at the hands of Black Lives Matter, La Raza and other black and brown supremacist groups.3. Chris Matthews Goes Into Hamster Rationalization Mode Hamster rationalizations are usually reserved for women, but effeminate, lowT manlets like Chris Matthews also have them. His first spin of the hamster wheel makes him say Hillary won the debates. She didnt. Then he says she had the best ad campaign. Nobody believes advertising or anything you say, anymore Chris. Then Matthews says she had the best ground game. She might have, but she was a terrible candidate. The halfman, halfalligator James Carville looked ready to give Chris a hug as the reality of Hillarys defeat began to settle in on MSNBC.2. The Racist Van Jones Whines About White People Van Jones looked like he needed a change of underwear as he fell back on tired, old leftist talking points from the 1960s about the evil white male especially white males that havent been turned into geldings. He then goes on with an emotional overreaction to say families will be afraid to have breakfast the next day because whitey got back into office. LMFAO. Really, dudeHe then says immigrants are afraid now that Trump is going to be President. No Van, immigrants arent afraid. Illegal hordes who figuratively if not literally say Fuck you to U.S. immigration law are afraid, as they should be.Jones then goes on to make a supremely ironic quote as he talks about a socalled whitelash He says Trumps campaign was based on Throwing away some of us to appeal more deeply to others. Umm, isnt that what the entire platform of the Democratic party is, Van Throwing away, nay, crucifying white men to appeal more deeply to others  Your entire career is based on just that, Mr. Jones.1. CBS Does A Mea Culpa CBS published an article admitting how badly the press is biasedCBS was so stunned it did a full mea culpa on the networks shoddy coverage of the 2016 election. This stunning article entitled The Unbearable Smugness of the Press needed to be written 10 years ago. Better late than never. CBS actually echoed what we in the manosphere and altright have been saying since day one with the OpEd piece.This is all symptomatic of modern journalisms great moral and intellectual failing its unbearable smugness . Had Hillary Clinton won, thered be a winking we did it feeling in the press, a sense that we were brave and called Trump a liar and saved the republic.The Eyeball network even admitted the contempt the network has for men like us.So much for that. The audience for our glib analysis and contempt for much of the electorate, it turned out, was rather limited. This was particularly true when it came to voters, the ones who turned out by the millions to deliver not only a rebuke to the political system but also the people who cover it. Trump knew what he was doing when he invited his crowds to jeer and hiss the reporters covering him. They hate us, and have for some time.And can you blame them Journalists love mocking Trump supporters. We insult their appearances. We dismiss them as racists and sexists. We emote on Twitter about how this or that comment or policy makes us feel one way or the other, and yet we reject their feelings as invalid.Damn. At least some people over there know why we hate them. That includes this former mainstream media news anchor who defectedShameless Activism Got Marxism Its the guiding philosophy of the alphabet channelsAnyone who has the capacity to perform an iota of critical thinking knows the mainstream media is NOT on the side of the average American. It hates and seethes at traditionalists and works to tear down every institution of Western civilization while attempting to impale the most hated of creatures on this planet, the Evil White Male.The rebuke of a sorry candidate like Hillary when the socialist shills thought she was a shoein caught the smug son of a bitches off guard. Their reactions are priceless, and need to be documented and remembered. These reactions are undeniable proof that blogs like Return Of Kings and web sites like Breitbart and Drudge are sorely needed, indispensable resources in this day and age.We have not been getting the truth from media for generations. And now, as alternative voices appear, the rift between the two versions of reality grows wider and deeper. The once mainstream media have become nothing but shameless activists for New World Order socialism. The election night horror show only solidifies this point.We should be proud to be activists pushing our own agenda, if nothing else to balance the scales. The media are NOT friends of the American public. Ultimately, the tired old Socialist media must be dismantled in order for freedom and traditionalism to survive .Read More Did The AntiDonald Trump Riot In Chicago Help Trump Cruise To Victory On Tuesday ",hate
"  The Sad Saga Of John Walker Lindh, Rebel Without A Clue The Sad Saga Of John Walker Lindh, Rebel Without A Clue Beau Albrecht My father was a highranking student radical poobah and still thinks Castro is the bees knees. Although this makes me technically a red diaper baby, I rejected all that baloney early on. These days, I write stories  mostly comedy science fiction  as well as maintain a blog mainly about dating advice, political commentary, and my writing projects. November 15, 2016 Culture John Walker Lindh grew up in the Washington, D.C. area. His family brought him to California when he was ten. In another ten years, he would become known as the American Taliban. While in Afghanistan, he was known as Sulayman alFaris, one of several Arabic monikers hes used over the years. Johnny joins the jihad There are moments when one realizes ones vacation is really starting to suck. When he was twelve, the young Lindh saw Spike Lees rather hagiographic film biography about Malcolm X. That began his fascination with Islam. While a teenager, he used the evocative email email protected and made several postings about rap music on Usenet. Sometimes he pretended to be Black, even having the nerve to dis Dr. Dre  hort Dog does hip hop no glory Wack like Dr Dre and his madeup gangster stories Sellout house nigga living honkey dory Saying hes broke in his own pool doing laps All these playground MCs fall off like scabs Skills disappear like alaka abracadab Dr Dres a disgrace selling out to the talcolm Hell be left dead and naked in the outcome Word to brother Malcolm Dre shirts and hats when will we see his cereal So whos the poseur there, anyway Im not sure whether to laugh at the sheer impertinence, or cry at the abuse of the English language. When he was sixteen, he formally converted, beginning his fateful journey. Meanwhile, his family situation was on shaky ground. His father turned gay , living parttime with his male lover , and eventually divorced. John began his world travels, twice venturing to Yemen, both times for nearly a year. Later, he stayed at a Pakistani madrassa. In May 2001, he went to Afghanistan to fight on behalf of the Taliban. Unfortunately for him, after September 11, American forces went to war with the Taliban. He was captured on November 25 after his unit surrendered in Kunduz. The CIA questioned him, and he claimed to be an Irishman. That must have been an interesting conversation, perhaps Ach, begorrah, top o the mornin to ye Presumably, pretending to be black again wouldnt have gotten him very far. Shortly after, the captive jihadis staged a bloody uprising , and Lindh escaped. Hundreds died, including Mike Spann, one of his interrogators. After that, he was recaptured andfollowing some rough treatment, not that Im shedding any tears about itquestioned again. He announced defiantly that he wasnt in the Taliban, but rather Al Qaeda. His actions sealed his doom. Fighting for the Taliban fruitcakes was a pretty dumb move on his part. His actions after being captured were even dumber. What could he have done differently In the beginning, he couldve said he was interested in Islam, and his quest for discovering his spiritual roots took him abroad. Then he could have lied and told them he was pressganged into the Taliban, and he was quite happy to be freed by his countrymen. He could have tipped off his interrogators about the planned escape attemptpotentially sparing many lives on both sidesas well as avoiding further criminal charges for himself. Had he given a helpful warning about the uprising, likely they wouldve concluded he was small fry and let him go. After that, he couldve become the star of the daytime TV talk shows. Then he couldve given speeches on the antiwar circuit, helping his jihadi buddies by saying they really arent that bad or whatever. Instead, he ended up faced with ten criminal charges, which couldve meant three life sentences plus ninety years. Finally getting smart, he copped a plea for twenty years, with the possibility of three off for good behavior. Now, hes in Federal prison, making the news back in 2012 by suing for the right to be allowed group prayer . What went wrong As Bush the Elder put it, Lindh was some misguided Marin County hottubber. Later, he apologized profusely for the remark. Still, I have to say that Bush 41 was onto something with that one all the criticism he got from that was because the truth hurts . Things couldve been different. Lindh didnt have to become a renegade. If hed made other choices, he could be living a happy life as a productive member of society, rather than counting the days in a prison cell. Still, his environment bears some responsibility for what he became. He was raised in the Catholic faith, but a stronger grounding in itas well as explaining some of the unpleasant realities about Islam to balance out the picture might have put the kibosh on his journey to jihad. A liberal environment should at least be able to explain why all thats bad. Or has liberalism become too wishywashy to assert its own values There wasnt much chance of parental guidance turning him from the wrong path his mother converted to Buddhism and his father left for the gay community. For that matter, if he had acquired an appreciation for good musicbe it Mozart or Metallicaperhaps he wouldnt have been so fascinated by irritating rap music. What kind of white kid is so alienated from his heritage that he pretends to be Black and laughably accuses Dr. Dre of selling out On that note, as for Malcolm X, didnt Lindh have some cultural icons of his own I have to wonder if he received much grounding in his own IrishAmerican heritage. All this is an illustration of what can happen when an impressionable adolescent is cast adrift in an  anything goes  environment. Islam speaks in absolutes, enjoining right conduct and forbidding haram conduct, and they fight for what they believe in. I cant fault them too much for that, although I disagree with their theology and actions on many points. Going further, Islam offers paradise for believerspromising seventy virgins to their martyrsand eternal hellfire and brimstone for the damned theres nothing wishywashy about it. Indeed, embracing radical Islam could be interpreted as an utter rejection of the anything goes world view. I certainly dont agree with Lindhs choices, but I can see how he found that compelling in comparison to being at sea in moral relativism . This certainly isnt the first time that people turned their backs on their countries and went abroad to give aid and comfort to the enemy. Jane Fondas North Vietnam adventure comes to mind an action she now regrets. More recently, there were about five hundred misguided youths who volunteered to be human shields in Iraq for their pal Saddam. For all their posturing, none of them got themselves blown up over there. Leaving aside the question of whether or not the resumption of war was justified, 500 fewer Social Justice Warriors wouldve helped cleanse the gene pool a bit. Then theres the odd case of Matthew Todd Miller , a Californian who went to North Korea, tore up his visa, and announced he was seeking political asylum. That ones an iffy case though later he said I just wanted to speak to an ordinary North Korean person about normal things. Kids these days In summary Dont let this happen to our youth. They must not grow up culturally bereft. In times past, children were taught about their countrys heritage, instructed in their culture, and pride in their nation was instilled in them. It was a given that these were presented as good things. These daysat least in much of the Western worldthis isnt happening. We cant count on the educational systemand certainly the mediato do that any more. Because of decades of cultural Marxism , young people are indoctrinated with a negative view of their own civilization. All societies, beliefs, and ways of life are equal, except yours are terrible. Those who dont see through that baloney end up rootless, alienated, and disconnected from their own culture. Some even end up thinking that their homeland is the embodiment of all evil while repressive regimes abroad are wonderful. This is basically what Social Justice Weenies think, something they have in common with young jihadi rebels without a clue. This will have to change, of course. Hopefully, the day will come when the media manipulators and educational bureaucrats who pushed cultural Marxism are standing in the unemployment line. For now, well have to pay close attention to the messages that the young people in our lives are absorbing, and help them learn to be secure in their faith and cultural identity. Teach them about their roots and why thats important. Dont let the TV be your childs babysitter. Anything goes is not a standard by which to raise our youth.",hate
"  Shopify Erased Our Store From The Internet While I Was Fulfilling 55 Orders Shopify Erased Our Store From The Internet While I Was Fulfilling 55 Orders November 15, 2016 Work  Money To launch a Return Of Kings tshirt shop, I decided to go with Shopify because of how much easier it is to launch than a selfhosted store. I signed up with them, paid for one year of service, and did a prelaunch with a small group of readers, which resulted in 55 orders. As I began fulfilling them, Shopify pulled the plug on the entire store without warning, both the public storefront and the administrative backend with all our data. Because of Shopifys decision, my customers couldnt access their order status, I had no way of informing them of what happened, and I couldnt fulfill remaining orders. They put both me and 55 individuals in the lurch for no legitamate reason, forcing me to threaten legal action in order to get enough information to complete fulfillment of all orders. The Backstory There are many open source solutions for hosting a web store. The problem with them is that it takes extra time to create the store and maintain it, compared to services like Shopify, Squarespace, Bigcommerce, Magento, and others. To get the ROK store up and running as quickly as possible, I picked Shopify because of their competitive prices, not knowing that I was in for a far greater price down the road. After I set up the store, featuring photos of yours truly in our first tshirt, I collected email addresses of those who were most interested with participating in the prelaunch. I sent this group an email announcing the store and 55 of them took action, ordering a tshirt or two. The shirt in question During this time, I received an email from a Shopify risk analyst by the name of Justin. He asked me to send in identification, which I was happy to do, and then asked me for more information Thanks for signing up with Shopify Payments and providing your ID. In order to complete this initial review and ensure payments continue to be sent to your account we would need a little bit more information. If you could send me any documentation you may have to validate the business that would be great. Examples would be a business bank statement, business license or business registration documents. Could you also confirm where youre primarily operating your business from I sent in my business incorporation documents, my IRS employer number designation, a recent bank statement from my USbased bank, and a note of how I often travel through Eastern Europe, but that my business, bank accounts, and tax status all reside in the United States. In spite of that, Shopify unjustly classified me as a foreign business and gave me no means to dispute it. Unfortunately, Shopify Payments is currently only available to companies that are based in Australia, Canada, United Kingdom and the United States, so we are not able to help with payments for your site right now. Its frustrating for us to have to turn down good businesses, but we need to make sure were abiding by both US and international regulations. This means that any successful charges you have will be transferred to you on schedule, but you wont be able to use Shopify Payments to accept any further payments.  Despite the information provided, our payment processing partner needs to ensure that the shops are based, operating from and have a substantial presence in the United States. Ultimately, their decision is final and we must respect it. According to the United States Federal Government and the IRS, my company is American and liable to pay American taxes, but to Shopify, Im not an American business. The repercussion from this was that I couldnt use Shopifys own payment system Shopify Payments and had to pay a 2 extra commision on all orders, but this wasnt a huge setback since there were many other payment options. I stayed the course because I wanted to do an ontime opening for my readers. I could always change stores later when it was convenient for me. The Disaster I have a worker based in the United States who maintains the shirt inventory and is charge of shipping them out. He printed most of the shipping labels for the first batch of orders and got ready for shipment. Before he was finished, I tried to log into the admin area of the store to monitor his progress and saw this The public storefront was also taken down. There was no longer any way for me to know who my customers were and what they ordered. I couldnt even send them an email. I then received this from Justin Hello, Im afraid that after reviewing your information and website we believe your business presents a level of risk for customer disputes that we will be unable to support on Shopify. We will transfer your existing payments to you, but will be unable to accept any additional payments on your behalf from Shopify Payments. Im sorry we wont be able to help with your business. Regards, Justin After I read this email, I was absolutely livid. Ive been doing business on the internet for over fifteen years, and have never had a situation where a company pulled the rug out from under me and my customers in a way that I would personally classify as fraud. They allowed me to take 55 orders, begin processing them, and then removed all access so I could not complete fulfillment. Imagine if you bought a shirt from me and then tried to access the store to see the status of your order. You would have no way to know whats going on and would probably think that I took your money and ran. Shopify created a situation of unneeded worry for 55 individuals while directly hurting my reputation as if Im running some sort a scam operation. The Phone Call To Support I called support and got on the line with a Level 1 support tech. I told him the situation as calmly as I could. His response send an email reply to Justin. This was unacceptable because politely complying with him through email beforehand had only resulted in the deletion of my entire store without warning. I demanded to speak with someone from the risk department but the support tech told me there was no way to patch me through since he was working remotely. I was not calling Shopifys main office but someone sitting in the middle of nowhere in his pajamas. I also told the support tech that there was no further information asked of me, that this was a unilateral closing of my shop while I was in the middle of fulfillment. If Shopify is so worried about fraud, why would they leave 55 individuals in a position where they would believe they got defrauded and start initiating chargebacks with their credit card companies I had no choice but to threaten legal action. I told the support tech that if Shopify doesnt give me a way to complete these 55 orders, I would pursue all legal means as a response to what I saw as fraud. The support tech put me on hold. After a few minutes of chatting with the risk team, he said that they have given him permission to send me a CSV file of all my orders. I decided that this was enough to satisfy the 55 individuals who purchased from me, but it still didnt allow me an easyway to process exchanges or refunds if one of my customers was unsatisfied with the shirt. Before ending the call with the support tech, I told him to relay to Justin and his team that they have created so much ill will by the way they have treated me that I will ensure that everyone knows exactly what they did, not just to me but also to my customers, who had an unfortunate experience because of their ecommerce platform. Using the CSV file I received, I was able to contact my customers to let them know of the situation and complete fulfillment. Many of them have already received their tshirts in the mail. The Lesson Shopify has every right to choose who to do business with, and I would not be particularly upset if they said I have to go elsewhere after fulfilling open orders , but the way they removed all access from my store is absolutely reprehensible and the stuff of nightmares for a business owner. No owner wants to wake up one day and find that everything is gone with no way to contact his customers. I have never been treated so poorly by an American internet business before, and Im confident that any business who treats people in this way wont be in business for long. Maybe my situation was special, as I am often abroad, but Shopify operates as if its customers are not even allowed to take a vacation out of the country. If you log in from a certain IP address pool, their algorithms go crazy and here comes Justin to hit the delete button on your store with one click. Whatever the reason, its important for existing and potential Shopify customers to know that it doesnt take much for them to shut you down at any moment and for any cause.

"  8 Ways To Forge Strength Through Challenges 8 Ways To Forge Strength Through Challenges Corey is an aspiring iconoclast. He believes that the key to life is for men to honour their primal nature. Learn more about his views at theprimalmale.com You can also follow him on Twitter . November 14, 2016 Mind We, modern men, need to constantly improve ourselves in a hostile world like ours that tries to debase us. While the lesser men embrace weakness and degeneracy, we must embrace strength and discipline. While whiners complain about how unfair the world is and how its better to just disengage, we must engage the world with greater willpower and defeat our enemies. Towards this end, I propose that we become both resilient and antifragile in every way possible. The following are ways you can turn a seemingly negative circumstances into strengths. 1. Stress Although stress has been maligned as the plague of the modern world that wrecks our mental and physical health, the way you perceive it makes a profound difference on how it affects you. New studies have shown that those who see stress as being toxic suffered damaging health effects while who saw it as being helpful were able to turn it into a source of energy to push them through their challenges. So, next time you feel stressed from whatever trouble you may be facing, remember that it is your friend. You must reframe the sensation and believe that its your body trying to help you. By changing how you processes stress, you can use it to succeed in life. 2. Obstacles Your response to obstacles reveal the kind of man you really are. Whatever obstacles you may face in your endeavors, you have two choices become frustrated and discouraged by it, or see it as an opportunity to grow stronger. Like stress, its the weaker mans inclination to view an obstacle as a confirmation of his own helplessness, but you must do better and face up to whatever gets in your way. Use every occasion to grow stronger from your obstacles and if you arent facing enough of them in your life, you need to get out and start doing more things. How you deal with obstacle will show your true nature as a man for the world to see. So, dont pussy out or moan about what you must overcome instead, be determined to rise above it. Your honor is at stake. 3. Failures Failures are inevitable in life. Although you should always try your best to succeed, you shouldnt be afraid to fail either. Just as with obstacles, view every instance of failure as an opportunity to learn and adapt. Its not failure itself that is bad, but not learning from it or giving up so easily. Remember winners dont quit they try to do better. 4. Rejection Rejection is a specific kind of failure that is often the most painful of them all. Its especially difficult because its often unclear whether it was actually your fault or not. I would say that its best to assume full responsibility for all the rejections you face and see what area you can improve to better increase your chance next time. As long as youre willing to learn and as long as youre willing to try again, you will grow. Master rejections and youll be placing yourself far above other men. 5. Physical Discomfort This is why Russians are so tough. Its well known that the human body is designed to be antifragile. Your bones get thicker with every blow and your skin gets tougher with every scrap. Pain and discomfort of all sorts also become more bearable the more you expose yourself to them. The more harshness you endure, the stronger you become over time. But inversely, the more comfortable you are, the softer you turn and the weaker you get. One simple method you can implement to become more healthy and energized is to start taking cold showers. The benefits of doing it are many, including stronger immune system, enhanced mood and energy, better circulation, boost in testosterone level, and so on. If you are having trouble getting started, start by doing just 30 seconds at the end of your usual warm shower and go from there. You want to train yourself until you can comfortably stand under the coldest water for at least five minutes. 6. Fear You cant really turn fear itself into a positive, but the process of conquering your fears can have a transformative effect on your life. Some of the proudest, most exciting, and memorable moments of my life were when I defied fears by doing a presentation in front of hundreds of people I had a terrible stagefright, going rock climbing I have a terrible fear of heights, and traveling for the first time by myself to a foreign country. One thing you can do to completely turn your life around is to do what this man did and make a list of all the fears that you wish to defeat. Write them down in an order from the least fearful to the most and start knocking them down one by one. Its impossible not to become a better man once you conquer them all. 7. Anger Like fear, anger is not something you can transform into a positive trait Ive heard of people transmutating their anger to rechannel the energy into other activities, but Ive never had it work that way. However, it is a good focal point to master your mind to become more stoic. It can also serve as your area of focus if you practice meditation. No matter how unpleasant, your anger will teach you a lot about yourself and only if you allow it. It will reveal your weaknesses, insecurities, and any other areas of your life in need of improvement. As one of the most base and primal of human emotions, you shouldnt just shirk it as something that is unneeded instead, make it your friend. 8. Negativity And Pessimism For the longest time, I felt guilty about being so negative because I was constantly told by everyone else that it was a bad thing. Smile, they said think positively, they said your life will improve, they said. I was constantly berated for not being part of the North American positivity cult. Its no wonder why people there tend to say that theyre doing great even when theyre feeling like shit a habit I have yet to fix. But in contrary to the long held belief that positive thinking and attitude gives you a better life, studies have shown just the opposite Forced positivity can actually harm you . For some people like me positive thinking backfires and makes things worse. Also, badtempered people who are pessimists have been shown to enjoy more successful marriages, be healthier, live longer, be better at negotiating, and more successful overall in life. So, if youre a natural grouch like me, its time to embrace who you are and tell the fakeass, positivity people to shove it. Conclusion The road to selfimprovement is an ugly and a bumpy one. I honestly cant say that I enjoy it. But no matter what, I know that it is a necessary part of being a man. I cant imagine myself not trying to be better in spite of all the difficulties. I refuse to live a life of complacency. Some people mock and insult our efforts , but know that their opinions dont matter. Lesser men have no say on what it means to live. So, fight on and prosper, for this is your one and only life.",hate
"Home This Month Popular Are You On Pace To Reach Your Goals Are You On Pace To Reach Your Goals February 2, 2013 20 Comments Lifestyle Today is February 2, 2013 and youre one month closer to death. What have you done this year to improve yourself Some may say New Years resolutions are copouts for actually setting reasonable goals, instead of starting today we say In a week Ill hit the gym and finally get ripped I like the idea of coming up with goals and plans to achieve them for January 1st of the next year. The start of each year is a mental rebirth, January 1 is a new snow begging for you to make fresh tracks in it, a blank canvas yearning to be painted on. However, many do use New Years resolutions to feel better about themselves. They gorge themselves on baked goods, drink heartily and fail to exercise throughout the month of December telling themselves that next year will be different and just one last time before I change. This is not the case for us here at Return of Kings. We are different  writers, readers, and commenters all strive to build themselves into the man they want to be. Personally, I had some slipups through the month of January, but what sets the determined apart from the shambling masses is that we pick ourselves up and keep pushing forward one step at a time . I started the year off strong my days and nights booked full with dates, time with girlfriends, reconnecting with old friends. I eschewed online dating and become more social during the day time. I broke PRs on all of my lifts, dropped a few pounds, and sought coaching for the Olympic lifts. Most importantly I held myself accountable for all of my actions. If I ate too much, drank too much or didnt take opportunities I should have, I picked myself up and adapted. Push forward and give everything you have. How bad do you want it What happens when you reach your goal Do you aim higher, or do you stop there and remain content with being slightly above average  If you choose the latter and have finite, concrete goals you are already anticipating the day you can quit building yourself. Youre doomed for failure.Dont ever miss an opportunity to get better , take risks , analyze your successes/failures, and dont stop until youve surpassed your goals. Then strive to be better, faster and stronger. What are your goals for 2013 Are they SMART  Do you have a purpose  Do you want to have sex with more beautiful women, learn a language , lift more weight and make more money Do you have an accountability buddy or do you journal and meticulously track your progress How is your progress going Feb 2, 2013 Western Cancer",hate
"Gentlemen, I am filled to the brim with joy. We have successfully thwarted the globalists plans to ruin Americaweve fought against the big banks, weve fought against the Satanic pedophile Elites , and weve fought against the corrupt mainstream media.But, the battle is not over yet. We still have much to do if we wish to make America great again. This will not be an easy fight, for we will certainly face much resistance along the way. Expect the cucks and liberals to throw temper tantrums as their safe spaces come tumbling down, expect the mainstream media to demonize the altright, and expect the elites to do everything they can to stop us.They will not stop us, thoughno, we are far too powerful. The wheels of truth do in fact turn slowly, but alas, they turn And they are growing in speed as we blaze towards victory. Here are four goals that we must achieve on our path to victory.1. Dismantle The Mainstream Media As more and more of us start to wake up, the media will begin to sense thisin fact, they already have. Have you wondered why theyve started to cover antiHillary stories Its because they realize that theyre losing credibility.The mainstream media is very well aware that theyre losing their chokehold on the American publics mind, so in a last ditch effort, theyre trying to seem unbiased. Do not buy into their liesits all a giant farce an attempt to regain their former credibility.Over the next four years, it will be extremely important to start dismantling these outlets. Its time to call them out for what they are. Start sharing altright stories on Facebook and Twitter, get our message out there. Dont watch any mainstream media.Dont buy mainstream magazines, dont watch their news shows, hell, dont even pay for cable. Do everything you can to bleed their pockets dry.As more and more money moves away from the mainstream media, it will naturally move towards alternative news sourcessites like Return Of Kings, Info Wars, Matt Forney , and Danger and Play will become the new media.Dont expect this to happen at first, however. In one final cry, before its gory death, the media will proclaim that there is a new racist, xenophobic enemy that helped Donald get into office the altright.Expect them to demonize us. Expect them to lie about us, to scream and shout, and to protest. This is fine, howeverfor we are antifragile. The altright is in a very unique position.Any and all hatred towards the altright will be a net win for us. Why Its simple any publicity is good publicity. A single mention of an alternative news site by the MSM can, and often does, net us tens of thousands of new viewers.In other words if they ignore us, we continue to grow in power. If they attack us, we grow even faster. They cant win.2. Drain The Swamp Everything that weve done up to this point to get Donald in office will be completely pointless if we dont drain the swamp. This is our one chancewe have four years to do this.In order for us to bring about permanent change in this country, we need to hold the cucks and libtards accountable for their actions. Anyone who pushed the proIslam agenda, rape culture, or feminazi philosophy must be called out for the traitors that they are.The elites, the corrupt bankers, and the globalists must all be brought to light. In order for us to bring about true change, and to prevent a globalist dictatorship from happening in the near future, we must ensure that at least 25 of Americans are aware of the elites conspiracy by the next election.This is a grass roots movement, and it is growing in powerbut we must take away power from those who tried so hard to fight us. Now is the time to cause a ruckus and email your representatives. Now is the time to demand Hillary be thrown in prison.Every single person involved in Hillary Clintons private email server must be thrown in jail. Pedophiles and Satanists such as Anthony Weiner and Marina Abramovic, and traitors such as Huma Abedin and Comey must be thrown in jail for their crimes.Now is the time to clear out the murky watersto sift through the dirt and rotten garbage lurking below. I believe, that once all is said and done, America will enter into a new age of prosperity. The patriarchy will return.3. Normalize Straight Males For too long have men been oppressed, by the very civilization which we created. We have let the SJWs and culture warriors back us into a corner, but weve finally started to fight back.More and more men, upon being exposed to the manosphere, are starting to wake up and take the red pill . Were starting to realize, as a nation, that there is no reason to be ashamed of being white or being a man.Once we start to dismantle the mainstream media and drain the swamp, most of this should happen naturallyit was only through the artificial social engineering that being a white male became a crime.But, we cant stop hereits time to start slowly redpilling our bluepilled friends. The best way to do this, is simply through osmosis. Dont try to convince them with logic, because they did not arrive at a bluepilled position through logic. They did so through emotion.Simply be a beacon of masculinity. Be confident in yourself, be assertive, and dont cave into ridiculous HR requests or political correctness social pressures. Again, once the mainstream media is dismantled and the manosphere grows in popularity, our movement will gain strength exponentially.The normalization of males, especially white males, is essential for our culture to continuethe second that we started to become ashamed of our heritage and of our nationality was the second that the cucks started closing in. We cannot give them an inch, or they will take a mile.This is not to say that our country shouldnt accept immigrantsIF they go through the legal process. How did it get so far that it became socially unacceptable to shame ILLEGAL immigrants Again, ILLEGAL immigrants Like I said, it got this way due to an overwhelming amount of white guilt. Do not be ashamed of your heritage, men.We have made a gigantic step towards national sovereignty with Donald Trump being elected as president, and we cannot let this victory go in vain. We must push onward and continue to normalize what is NORMAL. Being a straight male, white or note, should be the norm, not being a transgender, greenhaired, SJW.4. Get The Law On Our Side As our grass roots movement picks up more and more steam, I believe that the pressure we create will naturally push judges and lawmakers to change our corrupt legal system.First things first, we must create laws that treat men and women as they should be treated. Too many laws are skewed in favor of women. Now that women have the right to work, we must remove alimonyits ridiculous that men should have to pay 10,000 a month to their exwives, because she got used to a certain living situation.We must remove corrupt antimale divorce laws, ridiculous hatespeech laws which infringe on our freedom of speech, and ultimately, SJW rape laws.I, along with many other ROK men, have been falsely accused of rape . Its time to remove all of these ridiculous laws that make it illegal for men to simply talk to women, and that were built into the system by the elites in order to wage war against men.The law should encourage freedom of speech the fact that Twitter has not been held accountable for banning Milo Yiannopoulos is absolutely absurd. Information and social media platforms should be held to the same standards that the American people are.Google needs to stop censoring search resultsand if they dont, its time for us to create laws against this type of behavior. Allowing Google to filter search results is like a regression back to Medieval times. For one entity to selectively edit our version of reality is unacceptable.Most importantly, judges and lawmakers that have taken bribes should be thrown in jailindefinitely. Anyone who took a donation from George Soros or any other member of the Bilderberg group should be imprisoned for crimes of treason.Summary We are on the path towards victory, menbut it will not be without many hiccups. The first thing that the mainstream media will do is demonize the altright, but again, this will only make us stronger. It will expose our view points to a larger audience.Expect it to get darker just before the dawn. Expect feminists, SJWs, cucks, and libtards to protest and scream and shoutbut, it will all be in vain. Too many men are starting to wake up. Too many men are starting to see the lies that have been shoved down our throats , and there is no going back.The next four years will be more important than ever. Our primary objective is to dismantle the mainstream media through natural means. Its time for them to be exposed as the liars that they are. Simply eliminating the MSM will be most of the battleremember, this is a war of information, and when the altright starts to control the news, there will be sanity.We must also focus on draining the swamp. We must rid our corrupt political establishment of the people whove betrayed us. We must normalize the family unit and white menno longer shall we feel ashamed of our gender or sexual orientation.Then, from here, the laws must change. Remember this will not be easy. There will be much resistance along the way, but weve come this far. Weve beat all odds and elected Trump as the president of our nationand its time to make America great again.Read More Are You On Pace To Reach Your Goals ",hate
"One of the foundations of living a good life in todays times is having a good place to call home. Whether you want a solid, comfortable place with which to pursue your hobbies, recover from the days tribulations, and just to be, or whether you want a bachelor pad for your romantic pursuits, or both a good home is essential to the modern man.I purchased a home and I decided to be my own general contractor for the renovations. My home was an asoriginallyfurnished home of the 1970s, and I brought its multicolor painted, green shag carpeted datedness up to a sharply trimmed, hardwoodfloored modernity while being of a somewhat timeless style. A general contractor is a person hired by the architect or engineer to run the job site, source the labor, follow the schedule, get the materials, and execute the vision of the plan. Here are ten things I learned as my own general contractor.1. There are good contractors, and there are bad contractors You will run into both good and bad contractors out there. A good contractor does good work, at good value, follows the schedule, and is honest and doesnt lie to you. A bad contractor will do any or all of the above. I fired a contractor who had good value, but did poor work, could not follow the schedule, and lied to me. I paid more for a later contractor who did excellent work, hit the schedule on time, and was a perfectionist. Give a bad contractor a second chance, mainly to see how he corrects it and, if he fails to shape up, cut him loose.A good contractor has the correct amount of paperwork, but no more. Some firms I turned down did things by hand and had no contractors license, and that is too little, whereas a firm that gives you fifteen pages of legalese allowing them to take out an uncontested mechanics lien on your home if you do not pay is too much.A lot has to do with the presentation of the representative. Tradesmen are naturally rough people who work with their hands, but a man that does not have a good handshake, good eye contact, and is evasive on important details is shady.2. Good contractors cost more, and they are busy The best indicator of a good contractor is that they have a busy schedule, and I mean they are booked often a month or so in advance. The guy I fired kept trying to work me in on the weekends and at night, which, while it SEEMS like hes busy, hes actually operating in the red and trying to use your funds to cover his other jobs.A good contractor will negotiate terms up front and not change them, and he will, when awarded the job, put you in his schedule at an agreedupon time. My best contractor was so busy that I had to do other things first before I could get his firm to bid my work, and they did what good contractors do when they are too busy they turned down my work until later.3. You need to establish a reputation General contractors in an area have a reputation amongst their customers and the contractors they subcontract to, and the only difference between those that do it for a living and you is that you have no reputation.A busy contractor will work with a GC who will give them work in the future over one who will not. I was an unknown, so the busy guys during the busy season fall and preholidays would pass on me and work with ones they knew.However, word got around to the others that I gave jobs of good scope, and paid on time. I hired a sub contractor for a set of jobs, and, once they found out who I used as my electrician it was who they subbed their own electrical jobs to, they called and the electricians vouched that I was picky as all hell, but paid on time, and let them run their own schedule and have the run of the house. At that point, I was in.4. Good contractors know other good contractors Reputation works the other way too. A good roofer who I only turned down because he was too busy and wouldnt meet my timetable has a brother who runs the electrical shop mentioned above. Although you should ALWAYS get multiple competing quotes bid to three, two will generally respond, and pick the better one, the deciding factor was that his brother, the roofer, ran a good shop, and it stood to reason he would, too.My plumbers knew my AC guys and my chimney guy. My flooring guys knew my kitchen cabinets guys. Everyone works with and around everyone else, and I saved all my paperwork and contact info for all my vendors so that, on any future projects, I know who to call for what, and, even if I dont know, I know who to ask for recommendations.5. It will take more money than you think it will Home renovation is expensive, and its mainly for the nasty reason that, once you commit to action, you can get hit with extra costs. You can mitigate this with good bid scopes that you give to your contractors so all parties know what is what, but you will find that the home will need things you didnt think about, or that the hourly rate of the laborers is higher than you budgeted, or materials will simply cost more.Part of the balancing act that is required is you will learn what to spend money on now, and what to spend money on later. Right now, I live in the place finally, but I still have construction paper down on my floors as I have not yet bought furniture pads or rugs for the high traffic areas. My bathrooms have plumbing in, but no mirrors, cabinets, towel racks, or toilet paper holders. Entire rooms are without furniture. All of these can, and should, be taken care of later, but things like flooring and painting needed to happen earlier.6. It will take more time than you think it will You may not need something this complicated, but a Gantt chart shows dependency of one job on others.Contractors have their own schedules, and there is also the time outside the work time where they have to arrange a site visit, you have to juggle quotes, they have to then write you in, then they do the work, then theres followups and punchlists, and then, finally, that job is done and you pay them.You cant do some other jobs before you finish the first one. This is where having a master schedule and knowing who is doing what and affecting whom matters. My floor guys had to have the run of the place when they were finishing the floors, but they did not when they were laying subfloor, and I was able to have plumbers in that day as well. Contrariwise, I could not start the kitchen install until after the floors were done.7. Some of your ideas are wrong, some are right I had my own thoughts about what to do with the place. Sometimes I was wrong it was stupid to try to reuse the baseboard that was over the carpet and put it over the hardwood even though it was the same color and I listened to my contractor and used new. Sometimes I was right, my backsplash behind my sink was supposed to match the countertops colors, and the ratio of white I wanted was correct, but I was persuaded to add more by my contractor.Know what is important in your vision and be able to explain your intent, but the contractor might have a better way of how to do it in mind than if you had told them the how, instead of the what. I have a rather creative way of running the drains on my basement fixtures they did what I wanted, but did it in a better way than I would have suggested, and they got it almost completely right to my intent in the process.8. There will be gaps in your manpower coverage The one thing a professional general contractor does that you, as a private operator, will not is do all the basic stuff themselves. A GC will hire an electrician to wire fan boxes for mounting fans, but he will install the boxes and hang the fans himself. My electricians did install and hang them for me anyway.This was for two reasons, and this is how you can mitigate having little shit jobs that no one will want to do as a single job. The first is to provide all the materials yourself, which also allows you to pick out what you want. I had a pile of fixtures, fans, and bulbs laid out for them with a plan of what went where, and this helped them just throw them up after the technical wiring part was done.The second reason is to provide a good scope of work. Will a plumber come install a single faucet Maybe. Will he come install five and a garbage disposal Certainly, thats a good days work, so, if you have little jobs, have a LOT of little jobs, and youll get more interest.9. There are things with which you will not be satisfied good enough is good enough This house is old, but renovated. Some things simply cannot be fixed without massive upheaval I cannot have perfectly flat ceilings because the drywall is 40 years old and it had popcorn texture on it. Some things I did not address I have new baseboard and new window trim, but the door trim is original and has the nicks and stains of time.Some things were done, but were not perfect. The drywall where my kitchen cabinets bulkhead used to hang from the ceiling has one spot where, even after two reworks, still has a hairline paint crack. Some of the window film has pull away lines, and theres a couple things trapped under the film in places. One of the toilets will top itself off for a few seconds signifying a small seal issue. You cannot have perfection, but you can go for reasonable excellence.10. Code enforcement sucks The Man sucks. Someone called Code Enforcement on me, and I had to go get a permit of a cost of X of the renovations cost, mainly so they can jack my taxes up.I got the permit, and I expect my taxes to go up. The inspector was a real schmuck, as most appointed officials are, but the jokes on him, as I only got the permit on what I had left to do and I omitted some things that would still happen, but werent too noticeable.With code enforcement and county ordinances, the idea is reasonable cooperation and being able to explain things away with saying you were mistaken, instead of flouting the law. I went and got the permit when I was busted for it, but they only know a third of the story. Had I gotten a permit earlier, perhaps whatever nosy neighbor that ratted me out might not have called at all. Another tactic, which I will do on a future project I have planned, is to get the permit months ahead of time, then hit it hard over a few days and be done before anyone notices.Conclusion If you have the time, the patience, and the skill to know exactly what you want, who to get for it, and how to juggle a massive schedule, running your own home renovation is a lot of fun and very educational. If you want it done faster and just want to deal with one person for everything, then hiring a professional general contractor might be the way to go instead.Read More 14 Essential Subjects That We Will Teach Children At The ROK International School ",hate
"  3 Hollywood Films For BluePill Men That Reinforce SJW Values And Concepts 3 Hollywood Films For BluePill Men That Reinforce SJW Values And Concepts Bob Smith Bob Smith is a man in search of the truth. His favorite quotes are, Were all fools on this earth, and I can be no different I know its true, I read it at the LIEbrary and The truth is not misogynistic, its just the truth. November 16, 2016 Culture Your old Uncle Bob is mixing things up hereand I think you will see where Im going with this new angle of mine pretty quickly. I have selected three SJW films to review one from the 1960s, one from the 1980s, and one of much more recent vintage, from 2015. And what might all three of these insidious Hollywood movies have in common Why, they outwardly or subliminally program viewers to blindly adopt bluepill beliefs and behaviors, thats what I feel unsettlingly dirty just writing about these films, but somebodys gotta do it. So lets get busy here and expose these three, flatout, unintentional farces for what they really are. Seize the day. Onward and upward. Or is that downwardin this case, in terms of these three horrendously blatant SJW films, most definitely downward. 1. To Kill A Mockingbird 1962  Gregory Peck, Robert Duvall, Brock Peters, Mary Badham This multipleOscarwinning film is based on the PulitzerPrizewinning novel of the same name, which was written by Harper Lee and published in 1960and it is that Pulitzer Prize, and those multiple Oscars, that should be your first major clues that the Hollywood elitists were up to no good while crafting this brilliantly clever piece of SJW brainwashing. This wickedly hypnotic movie cleverly reinforces the statistically bankrupt notion that most white males in the American Deep South are vicious, stupid, ignorantly racist crackers who spend most of their time ruining the lives of innocent blacksthat is, when they arent shooting them down like dogs or lynching them outright. The plot centers around a hardworking, standup, straightarrow black man, Tom Robinson Brock Peters, who is falsely accused of rape by a conniving, whitetrash slut named Mayella Ewell Collin Wilcox, whose alcoholic father, Bob Ewell James Anderson, is a racist pig of unfathomably low character. The towns SJW lawyer, Atticus Finch Gregory Peck, plays white knight and comes rushing to Tom Robinsons defensemuch to the dismay of the local good ole boysbut despite his best efforts to free the poor, wrongly accused black man, Finch cannot hold back the powerful tide of racist anger, which ultimately results in the backwater towns killer cops shooting poor Tom down in cold blood a familiar theme, which can be abundantly found in todays world of dindunothin black folk, who are perennially and viciously gunned down by racist white cops, on an everincreasing and frightening basisyawn, Gee, never heard this one before.. Im not even going to get into the rest of this mindnumbing films plot and story line, because its a waste of both my time and yours. But I will mention a few correlative facts here, which you might find just a little bit interesting The SJWcontrolled civil rights movement exploded with a vengeance not long after this film was released. And heres the redpill truth of the matter according to the 1994 annual report on murder by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, most interracial murders in the USA involved black assailants and white victims, with blacks murdering whites at 18 times the rate that whites murder blacks. These stunning disparities began to emerge in the mid1960s, when there was a sharp increase in black crime against white people, an upsurge which, not so coincidentally enough, corresponds exactly with the beginning of the modern SJWcrafted civil rights movement. Blacks thus committed 7.5 times more violent interracial crimes than whites, even though the black population was only oneseventh the size of the white population at the time. This is according to the survey, Highlights from 20 Years of Surveying Crime Victims , published in 1993. Youll have to buy the book if you want to find out the real truth. These days, Washingtons SJW datagatherers no longer keep track of such  bigoted  statisticsprobably because they care about our safety so very, very deeply. Over the years, the cumulative effects have been staggering. Justice Department and FBI statistics indicate that between 1964 and 1994 more than 25 million violent interracial crimes were committed in the USA, overwhelmingly involving black offenders and white victims, and more than 45,000 people were killed in interracial murdersthe vast majority of them being blackonwhite killings. By comparison, 58,000 Americans died in the Vietnam War, and 34,000 were killed in the Korean War. I wonder how many additional people have been killed in America, during the escalation of these deliberately inflamed race wars, since 1995 Unfortunately, we cant get a look at those statistics, as previously mentioned, because the Puppet Masters no longer keep such records, so far as I can telland if they do, they definitely dont want us to see them. Be that as it may, the notions set forth in To Kill A Mockingbird are repulsively twisted, morally insidious and patently false. And if that offends anybody out there who might be reading this review, that makes my entire freaking day. Because in the end, all that should matter to any critically thinking person is the truth. And what Hollywood dishes out on a regular basis, is anything but 2. Gandhi 1982  Sir Ben Kingsley, Martin Sheen, Candice Bergen, Sir John Gielgud Supposedly, as the crafters of history have quite ingeniously led us to believe, Mohandas K. Gandhi played by Sir Ben Kingsley, in this multipleOscarwinning film utilized the greatest weapon of all in his epic fight against British tyranny on behalf of the Indian peoplethe incredibly effective method of nonviolent resistance. And in the movie, Gandhi , there is a sequence in the film featuring a large group of noncompliant protesters, as it faces down a group of security forces armed with sticks, outside of a salt factory, the end result being that the protesters get the holy crap beaten out of them. In reality, that was basically all that happened. There was a public dogandpony show, shortly after this supposedly reallife event, which was choreographed by the elitistowned media. And indeed, in this cleverly constructed movie, actor Martin Sheen can be seen describing the bloody mayhem at the factory over the telephone to his cohorts back in the USA Sheen plays American Journalist Vince Walker in the film. And what Sheens character witnessed, and put into words, and then passed along to his editor over the phone, was summarily put into print in vast numbers of elitistowned newspapers, as well as on film, in elitistowned news reels, and marketed all over the worldwhich resulted in bringing worldwide focus on the terrorist acts of the security workers at the salt factory. This entire episode was allegedly a key element of Indias signature accomplishment of gaining her independence from the British. Despite the fact that every single major worldwide event that finds its way into the mainstream medias propaganda conduits, is either a completely staged event like the Indian protesters getting beaten outside the salt mine, IMHO, or something that meshes well with the elites overall master plan, or they will not even put it into print or on film to begin with 90 of the worlds major media companies are owned by just six major players, we are supposed to believe that the elitistproduced film, Gandhi , depicts reallife events that occurred as the direct result of one brave man in a loincloth, who stood up to the ferocious might of the British Empire and brought the entire house down, singlehandedly Please. Youd have a better chance of talking me into using Tinder. There is another infamous sequence in the film, wherein a group of Hindi demonstrators is peacefully assembling in protest, within an enclosed, parklike area of the Indian city of Amritsar. The demonstrators are consequently assaulted by British soldiers, who open fire, brutally and randomly, on the assembled sitting ducks, and proceed to gun down hundreds of protesters this incident allegedly occurred on April 13, 1919, and some estimates put the actual number of demonstrators killed at well over 1000. And in this single, crucial, very revealing sequence of the film, the sobering truth is once again put on display for all to seeassembling peacefully, going against the grain of the established order, by utilizing peaceful protest and noncompliance within a group setting, is exactly what the elite want the people to do. Because it makes it a whole lot easier to identify them and kill them. In the film, after the mass slaughter, the soldiers commander is dressed down by his higherups for taking the law into his own hands, and gunning down the peaceful demonstrators. But that was all done strictly for show. And this is most obviously a case of cinematic cover here, as anyone who can think for themselves can easily infer who do you think produced Gandhi uh, that would be an elitistowned film company, Columbia Picturesdo you really think the elite are going to pass along the bona fide solution to wiping them outuh, no way last time I checked, rattlesnakes dont commit suicide. The British Empire has a long and bloody history of usurping lands. And the notion that the stringpullers at the very top of the greasy flagpole would be aghast at the actions of the British commander who ordered the slaughter at Amritsar, is comical at best. What the slaughter at Amritsar actually accomplished in addition to the massmurder of a huge swath of ardent protesters was the following With the complicit assistance of the elitistowned press, the British commanders actions that day reinforced the suicidal notion that peaceful protest and nonviolent resistance were the keys to bringing about significant social change. And throughout history, other choreographed events like the slaughter at Amritsar and the subsequent explosion of moral outrage, fueled by the reports in the eliteowned media, have continued to give rise to the suicidal notion that nonviolent resistance actually works. Which of course it does, but only in isolated, highprofile, choreographed incidents, where the outcome has already been decided beforehand, whenever the Puppet Masters want it to appear that way to the sleeping sheepthe rest of the time, it only results in massincarceration, physical assault, political harassment or murder. On a more subtle note, you might have noticed that two of the leading actors in this Oscarwinning film were eventually knighted by the British Empirenamely, Sir Ben Kingsley knighted in 2001 and Sir John Gielgud knighted in 1953to which I can only say, I rest my case, Your Honor. 3 The Gift 2015  Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall, Joel Edgerton, Allison Tolman I dont typically watch modern Hollywood films these days. Mostly because I know what Hollywood is up to, so I normally avoid them in the exact same way that I avoid single mothers with tramp stamps, or chicks with green hair. But I went ahead and checked out this absolute mindfuck of a movie on Showtime the other night, knowing it would probably throw me a wicked, SJW curveballand sure enough, it didnt disappoint. As an aside, I threw this film into the mix, juxtaposed with the previous two Oscarwinners, partly to demonstrate how far the bar has fallen in the Hollywood filmmaking industry, in terms of the standard of quality. They dont even try to hide the SJW brainwashing madness in their films any longer. At least back in the day, they could mindfuck the sheep in an entertaining and captivating way, while keeping their overall intentions under the radarbut today, as this next film proves Not so much. Simon Callem Jason Bateman has a horrifying secret buried in his twisted past, and his wife, Robyn Rebecca Hall, is clueless about the whole thing innocent white female vs. evil white male, the usual bullshit here. The couple relocates from Chicago to a suburb of Los Angeles, where they run into Gordon Gordo Moseley Joel Edgerton, a creepy, awkward, socially inept former high school classmate of Simons. Gordo starts dropping by the couples new house, uninvited and unannounced, and he does so on far too many occasions. Simon thinks Gordons behavior is weird which it is, but his SJW wife thinks Gordo is sweet, shy, and simply misunderstood. Gordos weirdness escalates in typical boremetodeath fashion Hollywood is really great at this audiencewowing technique lately, until Robyn finally discovers her husbands longheld secret he bullied poor Gordo back in high school, by inventing a story about him, which centered around a homosexual relationship that Gordo never had. The horrendously unfair story got back to Gordos father, and Gordos father nearly killed him Of course, Simons liberal, SJW, brainwashed wife eventually wants her bullyboy husband out of her life forever, shortly after discovering this unforgivable transgression even though shes pregnant with their first child, and they were very much in love up to this point yeah, like that would ever happen in real life. The SJW bullshit meter spikes so hard in this film, that youll be left slackjawed, stunned and eyerollingly incredulous, and if you are unfortunate enough to have to sit through this absolutely putrid piece of garbage, be sure to keep a barfbucket handy especially for the endingbecause you are definitely going to need it. Hopefully, its getting a whole lot easier for you to spot the bullshit that is being sold, not only in todays SJW Hollywood films, but in Hollywood films of days gone by most especially Oscar winners. The elite are always using the magic of Hollywood for nefarious purposesnamely, to magically instill behaviors in its audience members that will get them into trouble, or instill beliefs in them that are totally divorced from reality. Doing this makes it much easier to divide the moviegoing sheep, and thereby conquer them, typically by race, or by historical beliefs, or by sociopolitical beliefs. So do yourself, and the world, a huge favor, and avoid SJW Hollywood films wherever and whenever you can. The rule is simple if its being made in Hollywood today, its a BPO film blue pill only. And unfortunately, as it pertains to movies that were made all the way back in the early 1960s if not even further, well, as we have just seen, the same rule applies, in many cases. By boycotting Hollywood films, you are lessening the degree of brainwashing to which you subject yourself, simply by being alive in the world at the present time. And in this particular case, less is most definitely more .",hate
"  How The Camp Of The Saints Predicted The Migrant Destruction Of Europe How The Camp Of The Saints Predicted The Migrant Destruction Of Europe Daryush Roosh Valizadeh created ROK in October 2012. You can visit his blog at RooshV.com or follow him on Twitter and Facebook RSS November 16, 2016 Books Written in 1973, The Camp Of The Saints is a novel by Jean Raspail that predicted the European migrant crisis forty years before it began, not only the actual invasion by brown migrants but also the leftist arguments that enabled it, which ushered Europe to its doom. The story follows a onemillion strong flotilla of Indians who are slowly making their way to Europe. The leaders and people of Europe have decided not to stop their arrival. Light on action, the book focuses on the mood of the pending arrival, particularly how Europeans were eager to cuck themselves into oblivion. After all your helpall the seeds, and drugs, and technologymigrants found it so much simpler just to say, Heres my son, heres my daughter. Take them. Take me. Take us all to your country. And the idea caught on. You thought it was fine. You encouraged it, organized it. But now its too big, now its out of your hands. Its a flood. A deluge. And its out of control.  Youve gone and worked up a race problem out of whole cloth, right in the heart of the white world, just to destroy it. Thats what youre after. You want to destroy our world, our whole way of life. Raspail understood how the media whips the public into feeling immense guilt as a mechanism to introduce nonwhite migrants. Well before the globalist view on migration and equality was elucidated, Raspail was steps ahead in predicting what the result of it would be, as if he was reading into a crystal ball. He even knew that migrants would bring diseases like tuberculosis . And all at once whole sections of New York are deserted, a score of American cities watch the flight to the suburbsand half the historic Paris pavement tooAmerican tots in their integrated schools fall five years behind, tubercular Gauls flee in droves from our openair clinics.  Tallyho Tallyho Just listen to that battering ram smash at the southern gate The centurieslong segregation of the first and thirdworld brought great complacency upon Europe. No one could really get a grasp of what was in store once the thirdworld reached critical mass and started invading the West. I can tell, Vilsberg continued, that you really dont believe how serious the situation is. After all, we lived side by side with the Third World, convinced that our hermetic coexistence, our global segregation, would last forever. What a deadly illusion Now we see that the Third World is a great unbridled mass, obeying only those impulsive urges that well up when millions of hapless wills come together in the grip of despair. In a bittersweet scene, one of the prominent media leftists goes out with his wife to celebrate the arrival of the flotilla with joyous Africans. Towards the end of the party, his wife gets brutally raped by them and he eventually dies in sorrow. The hordes arrival suddenly awakened all the immigrants already in the country into asserting themselves. They began stealing directly from the native citizens by attacking their white privilege. Now, its a known fact that racism comes in two forms that practiced by whitesheinous and inexcusable, whatever its motivesand that practiced by blacksquite justified, whatever its excesses, since its merely the expression of a righteous revenge, and its up to the whites to be patient and understanding. What drives the maniacal leftist Raspail believes its a suicide mechanism, likely activated by a human organism void of spirit and with no reason to endure a cosmopolitan existence. Attempting to destroy its host culture is an indirect way of killing itself. Whenever the pop tunes would lose their blaring charm, there was nothing left but to let oneself drown in the stickysweet syrup of human misery and despair, set to music of sorts, that one refuge of yearning and unfulfilled souls that had learned nothing else. It never occurred to any of them to measure that notion of misery against the past, or against their own wellbeing. For them it was a drug, and they needed to shoot up a good strong dose to keep themselves going, like addicts and their heroin. The fact that it was often hard to come by close to home made very little difference. Nothing stops an addict when he has to have his fix, and poisons like that are easy to import. Theres never a lack of pushers. Besides, modern man has always had, tucked away in the back of his mind, that singular longing for total destruction, sole cure for the boredom and anguish that consume him. The book even predicted a cucked Catholic Church. Raspail knew that every institution had to be on board with Europes destruction for the thirdworld invasion to proceed seamlessly. I came south like a lot of other priests, father, to hail what I thought would be mankinds redemption. To welcome the million Christs on board those ships, who would rise up, reborn, and signal the dawn of a just, new day. The European women who welcomed the refugees became whores for them. If you think this is too extreme, consider that European women are getting raped by migrants today but not reporting the crime , yet if a white man so much as brushes past them, hes accused of assault . She died in Nice, in a whorehouse for Hindus, disgusted with everything in general and herself in particular. At the time, each refugee quarter had its stock of white women, all free for the taking. And perfectly legal.  Yes, the Third World had started to overflow its banks, and the West was its sewer. Raspail even predicted the fact that the media would elevant the interracial couplings of white women and the invaders. We saw something similar recently when the German government sponsored sex workshops for migrants on how to fornicate with German girls. Ralph Ginzburg, the famous American publisher, had printed a series of photos in his magazine Eros, which had caused not a little ink to be spilled. They showed an interracial couplewhite woman, black manin various stages of nude embrace. With a caption that read as follows Tomorrow these couples will be recognized as the pioneers of an enlightened age, in which prejudice will be dead and the only race will be the human race. The fleet made landfall in France. The French, impotent to do the right thing to save their country, tripped head first into spreading the welcome mat they actually competed with each other to see who would be the most welcoming. You can imagine the result when one million wretches made landfall in a country they cared nothing about. The new social justice government that rose forth catered to the invaders more than the French, similar to what we already see in Western European nations. In war, the real enemy is always behind the lines. Never in front of you, never among you. Always at your back. Thats something every soldier knows. In every army, since the world began. And plenty of times theyve been tempted to turn their backs on the enemythe socalled enemy, that isand give it to the real one, once and for all.  When freedom expands to mean freedom of instinct and social destruction, then freedom is dead. The book itself wasnt my style of storytelling. Raspail made numerous detours and longwinded soliloquies that took away from the action in favor of creating accurate character portrayals. Its more of a mood novel than one that moved forward at an exciting pace. The only flaw is that it didnt predict the rise of an alternative media that would sound the alarm bell. Even though an active invasion is taking place today, the antimigrant side is far stronger than whats portrayed in the book. The Camp Of The Saints was a prophetic story that showed how the migrants themselves werent the only cause of Europes destructionleftists played the largest role in ripping apart the country before their arrival, a fact that many of us already know too well.

"I remember signing up for Facebook ten years ago. At this point in time, the new social media site was geared mostly toward college students and it was uncommon for anyone over the age of 25 to have an account. But over the last decade weve seen Facebook morph into a 50 billion conglomerate and information kingpin acquiring massive power and wealth from the endless amounts of time users waste scrolling through their news feeds. This beast of a social media platform has gone on to consume the lives of millions, gather nefarious amounts of data, foster unnecessary personal dramas, and often cause more harm than good for its users. It would be prudent to take a good hard look at your Facebook experience and ask yourself if its something thats actually adding value to your life. Here are five reasons why you should think carefully before using the worlds largest social media site. 1. Your Facebook Feed Is A Black Hole Of Completely Worthless Information I think its important to create streams of information that add real value to your life. Through platforms such as Twitter, Feedly, and YouTube, Ive followed writers and content producers that have dedicated their lives to selfimprovement, entrepreneurship, higher meaning, and the search for truth. So you can probably imagine the stark difference between an intellectually curated Twitter feed and the dumbeddown Facebook community of people you went to high school with that peaked in the 12th grade. Log into your Facebook and the most common information youll likely find is who got married, who had kids, and who got fat. Scrolling through your Facebook feed is akin to flipping through a more personalized celebrity gossip magazine at the grocery store checkout line. Every time I log onto Facebook Im immediately reminded why I never log onto Facebook. 2. Its No Longer Useful For Dating In college, I gained some value out of the site by using its chat feature to build up attraction with girls in my social circle and get their phone numbers. But over the years, most girls have attached the creepy stigma to guys who hit them up via Facebook messenger. In addition to that, you dont really need a Facebook profile for social proof as you once did since Instagram is a better social media app for meeting girls . 3. Forfeiture Of Your Privacy Most people have realized by now that the first thing a potential employer will do after interviewing you is look you up on Facebook. Theyre basically searching for any and every reason not to hire you. Lock your account down as best you can with privacy functions. Dont let that one drunk picture of you from 5 years ago ruin a potential job offer. If that wasnt enough, Facebook has a long history of shady activities when it comes to privacy. Theyve already been caught accessing your location without permission. We can only speculate what else theyve been infringing on.4. Censorship Although Facebook has a right to control the information broadcasted on its platform, that doesnt mean they should abuse that right by censoring anything they might find disagreeable or offensive. Much like an overbearing parent, Facebook proactively controls the discourse of its children, eagerly censoring content that might rub someone the wrong way. Facebook has so many overreaches that an entire website has been dedicated to documenting their affronts on freedom of opinion. You can probably guess which side of the political spectrum they try to stifle.5. It Brings Out The Worst In People Plenty of time has now passed for indepth research to come out regarding the longterm effects that too much Facebook can have on a persons mental wellbeing. It gives the illusion that everyone else has it better than you and that your life just isnt fair. This is a slippery slope into a victim mindset and blaming others for your circumstances. How oppressed these chronic Facebook users are as they sip lattes from a comfy chair in Starbucks and scroll through their Facebook feeds on the latest Macbook.I wont completely deny the merits of Facebook. If youre using it to build a brand or a business then it could be a good investment of your time, simply because so many people actively use it. Ive also witnessed the joy it brings to older users for connecting with long lost friends they havent seen in decades. But the truth is that in many cases, Facebook does cause more trouble than its worth. Its never a bad idea to cut back on your usage or even just opt out entirely. You may no longer be the first to know about an upcoming dinner party or what Brad and Sarah from freshman year have been up to all these years, but I suspect you might be better off as a person.Read More Is Western Civilization Worth Saving ",hate

It is seen by many as the one of the greatest gangster movie of all time and changed forever the image of the traditional justiceseeking hero.It has been a few years at least that I want to share my discovery of this film with our readers. It had a tremendous impact on the way I see the world and the attitude I have towards life. I was convinced of its quality, of the impact it could have on the disciples of the red pill and that a few lines cannot do justice to this giant of Russian cinema culture. It entirely deserves an article of its own.My brother, the criminal Enter Danila Bagrov, played by the stellar Sergey Bodrov, who died at 28, at the peak of his meteorlike career. Many called him the Russian James Dean.After serving in the bloody war theatre of Chechnya, young veteran Danila returns home, in the sleepy provincial town of Tula.Needing money and without any solid prospects, he joins his brother Vytia who works as a hitman for the local welldressed businessman in Saint Petersburg. Being an expert in making rudimentary weapons and with his quick capacity of reaction and frugality, Danila adapts marvelously to his new occupation.After seeing the risk of a gifted concurrent stealing their livelihood, the citys gangsters soon put a price on his head and send a few professionals to tie up this loose end. But even after being betrayed by a mix of greed and cowardice, young Danila Bagrov decides to take on the mob single handedly.An epitome of the Russian alpha. Hard and unforgiving, sober in words and in behaviour, for whom nothing counts more than the bonds of blood and brotherhood.To err is human His one soft spot is the faith he has in human nature, convinced that if he does good, his fellow man will be virtuous in return. He could not be more wrong, especially with women. He discovers very fast that beta moves like buying them gifts and helping them only brings him trouble or ungratefulness.What is rare and makes Danila stand out is his loyalty, a cornerstone of the definition of masculinity and a value that progressively vanishes nowadays. His brother will do the unthinkable. But after the storm clears and Danila emerges victorious, he proves once more his quality as a man by being magnanimous and giving him a second chance.No fancy green screen or politically correct themes Brat is good because it is painfully real and does not embellish the lawless chaos that was early postSoviet Russia. This is how it felt when the Wall came down. Everyone was trying to survive the best way they could.The odd, lowquality orange filter used in the film reminds us of this period where everything was made from what people could find when the shelves where empty.You cannot go wrong with a good revenge movie and Danila is an example of bravery. Alone and against all odds, he takes on the mafia that wronged him and will make them pay.The man says it like it is His analysis of the city and its perverse influence on men is brutally accurateDanila You told me about the city, about its strength. But here, everyone is weak.Hoffman The city is a great and terrible force. It sucks the life force out of the strong  turns them weak. It takes away your power. And you fell right in the middle of it.His opinion about the abuse of power and the corrupt elites that would kill mother and father for their own profit and the final victory of truth applies especially well to todays political and social context.American, whats your power Is it really money My brother says its money. Youve got lots of money  so whatTruth is a real power. Whoever is right is strong. You cheated on a man and took away his money. Did it make you stronger No, it did not, cause you are not right, and the person you cheated on is. That means hes stronger. RightBrother also drops lethal truths about women and their ways.

They attacked his brothers once more and he will have this time to cross the Atlantic to reclaim what is rightfully his.Again, the movie is realistic, gritty but has a lighter outlook on life. Whereas in the first volume, the main character showed a sheer hatred for everything that came from America and corrupted his country, the sequel that involves Danilas adventures and clueless discovery of American culture often results in hilarious encounters.Un film qui prend aux tripes If the red pill was a religion, Danila Bagrov could be its patron saint.

"Before Trumps glorious victory over the forces of progressive darkness, I promised that I would provide a roadmap on what traditional men could do next to usher in a return of the patriarchy. If Hillary had prevailed, the roadmap would have been a grim one, as all of our work would have had to take place underground. Happily, we will be able to work in the open. Here are three ways that we can leverage Trumps victory to bring back the patriarchy.Rule yourself Bruce Wayne is a good role model for traditional men Urbane, fit, financially independentand dangerous.This may seem obvious, but if we are going to bring back the patriarchy, we have to be men who are worthy of it. A patriarch who relies solely on the fact that he is a man will quickly be overthrown. However, a man who has authority because he has earned it by the way he lives will naturally retain it. Thus, the first step in making progress under a Trump administration is the same as it would have been if Hillary had been electedselfimprovement.Selfimprovement involves the obvious things getting in shape, training martial arts, getting rid of addictions, and exercising selfdiscipline. The process of selfimprovement needs to be undergirded with a philosophy of life. For most men, this will involve adopting, and faithfully living, one of the faithtraditions. For others, it may mean adopting stoic philosophy. Whatever it is, it will have to be more substantial than the degenerate, pleasure, wealth, and power at any cost morality of our Spirit Cooking eliteslack of morality got us into this problem in the first place.Selfimprovement also involves moving in the direction of financial independence. Under a Trump administration, this last goal will become easier to achieve. Trumps tax plan cuts tax rates across the board. This will especially benefit men who are in the middle class who are trying to generate more income. They will be able to keep their savings so that they can move ahead rather than paying a penalty that keeps them from becoming wealthy.Trumps emphasis on fair trade will also result in more American jobs and unleash unprecedented creativity. The age of Trump will be a great time to start a new business. One word of warning is in order though Under Trump the US is likely to flourish in a way that hasnt happened since the the 1920s. Enjoy the prosperity but dont get caught back in the materialism merrygoround. Our goal is a lifetime of financial independence, not conspicuous consumption.Financial independence is an important practical consideration because you will need a firm financial foundation for the second step, which is ruling your family.Rule your family Be the patriarch.Starting with the boomers, our society rejected the traditional way of life and adopted progressivism. Families got smaller, divorce became more common, promiscuity increased, feminism became the default philosophy for girls, and the remaining vestiges of the patriarchy vanished. Progressivism promised freedom but delivered enslavement to political correctness and globalism.A Trump administration will do little to reverse the deleterious effects that progressivism has had on the family. At best, the only thing government can do for the family is encourage it financially and provide a safe environment for it. But real change has to come from the bottom upfrom men and women who return to tradition. For us, that means finding a traditional woman, or more likely one who can be converted to tradition, getting married, and having lots of children. A Twitter shitlord  @johnrandom1234  drove home this point in a humorous way by suggesting with a fourstep Trump Bump starter kitGetting married, having children, and raising them to hold to the patriarchy is the long game, but it is the only way we will have long term victory. Without a next generation of traditional men, any ground that we gain under Trump will soon be lost.Rule societybring back the patriarchy Benjamin Franklin is a great example of a man who was serious about his civic duty.The next thing that we must do is start reclaiming our institutions. Trump has captured the presidency and Republicans control Congress, but many of those Republicans are cucks who will oppose the Trumpian agenda. And our other institutions are still dominated by leftists. Hollywood, the news media, education, and corporations all proclaim the progressive, antipatriarchy message. If we dont take advantage of the current moment, any gains that Trump makes will be quickly rolledback after he leaves office.Therefore, we need to start reengaging with these institutions to shift them towards Patriarchal Nationalism . You can share any ideas you have to do this in the comments. Here, Id like to suggest that one institution that needs our participation the Republican Party. Trump has created many allies within the GOP but the majority of the Party still holds to the cucked ideology of open borders and bad trade deals like NAFTA. The GOP desperately needs likeminded men within its ranks who will help Trump achieve his vision.Getting involved in your local GOP is easy. You merely have to get in touch with your local party leadership in your district. You dont have to run for elected office. Simply volunteer your time in getting local officials elected, voting for delegates, or attending GOP events. Go in with a respectful attitude. A lot of the local GOP leaders are good people who still dont understand that the real battle is against globalists. Work for incremental change. And, if you have the disposition required for it, consider running for local office yourself.One piece of advice If you do choose to get involved in politics, dont get caught up in it. One way we ended up with an ossified and outoftouch GOP is that people started to hold the globalist neoconservatism with an almost religious fervor. The other trap is to use politics as a way of enriching oneself in the manner of Hillary Clinton. If you do choose to enter the political realm, resolve at the outset to not use it for your own financial gain. Dont make politics your life. Think of it strictly as civic duty.Of course, politics is not everybodys cup of tea. The key is to use your gifts, whether that is in moviemaking or in running a company, to help create an environment where the patriarchy can flourish.Conclusion The one thing we must not do in wake of the Trump victory is rest on our laurels. If Hillary had won, wed all have a great sense of urgency to protect what little remained of our way of life. Now that Trump is coming into power, the temptation is to relaxto just let Trump do it all. This temptation must be avoided. We must capitalize on the Trump victory with the same high level of urgency that we would have regarded a Hillary victory. If we dont, we run the risk of losing all the ground we have gained.Read More How Donald Trump Vanquished His Enemies And Conquered The Republican Party ",hate

By staffing his administration with committed nationalists, well make it easier for President Trump to fulfill his political program, as well as make it more difficult for him to go back on his promises. Remember, it was rankandfile FBI agents who forced James Comey to reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton  a leader needs loyal men in order to carry out his agenda.2. Youll be able to make history Given the momentous task of rebuilding America after eight years of Obamas perfidy and failure, you almost have a civic duty to help President Trump in his mission.

Youll help trigger the left Despite their massive losses in the electionbeyond Hillary Clintons defeat, the Democrats now control only a handful of state governments and failed to dent the GOPs Congressional majoritythe leftist mainstream media is trying to order Trump around and persuade him to staff his administration with the same flacks who filled Bushs and Obamas. Right now, theyre freaking out over Breitbart executive chairman Stephen Bannon being appointed as Trumps chief strategist .By joining the Trump administration, youll have a hand in helping trigger the left into conniption fits and spasms of impotence. Nothing horrifies them more than losing access to the levers of power, which theyve controlled for decades. Watching leftists squirm and cry is one of the biggest fringe benefits of Trumps victory, and we need to keep the triggering up for years to come.If you think you have the job skills, Return Of Kings highly recommends you apply for a job in Trumps administration .

Currently the OECD country is roughly on the same material and economic level as other affluent East Asian nations such as Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan. However, it appears now as perhaps the most potentially strong among them. South Korea seems more dynamic and willful than its larger neighbor and economic main rival, Japan, which perhaps has entered the path of a more longterm decline.In this article I do briefly describe the main characteristics of contemporary South Korea, and also reflect upon various cultural subtopics which are of importance for any male who is interested in to obtain more sophisticated knowledge about nonWestern cultures and what they might and might not offer.The emergence of modern South Korea Culturally, politically, technologically and economically, South Korean development during the 20th century onward cannot be understood without to mention the strong ties to Japan and the United States. As much as Japan suppressed Korea between 19101945, the material progression is nevertheless a direct and indirect consequence of the traumatic colonial period. Korean leaders were also inspired by the Japanese military dictatorship which in turn was influenced by European militarism. After South Koreawhich was formed in 1945 after the divide of the countrystopped relying on American aid and focused on its own potential, the economy grew rapidly due to an effective exportoriented industrialization.Democracy was gradually introduced in 1987 but some of these authoritarian residues are still visible in todays society, the military in particular, but also with regard to how many companies are run.Presently the economicpolitical relationships between South Korea and Japan remain flexible and pragmatic, for the sake of both countries. The ties to the US seems less problematic, although Koreans negotiate between on one hand a more distinguished Korean culture and on the other further Western influences.Additional ambivalence might also be a result of that some Koreans regard American relations as a hinder in the process of a future reunification between the two Korean nations. Generally, though, the political, military and economic cooperation between South Korea and the US appears fruitful and to the benefit of both sides.The Korean wave and the rising appeal of South Korea For quite a long time, modern South Korea may be regarded as not much more than a smaller version of Japan, although with a unique language and some other differentiating characteristics. In postmillennial times, however, this picture has gradually shiftedboth among other Asians, Westerners, and people in other continents tootowards a more appealing national image.The reason for this is mainly material, related to a refined development of technology Samsung, pop music Kpop, TV dramas Kdrama, cosmetic products Kbeauty, and perhaps also a more exciting metropolitan nightlife and a better ranked top university Seoul National University. The Korean wave, Hallyu, covers a whole plethora of different expressions of the rising popularity of South Korean products and celebrities and it has had spillover effects for other sectors such as academia and tourism. For instance, more people are interested in learning Korean than 10 or 20 years ago.The nightlife in the capital, Seoul, is unhesitatingly of very high standard. For instance, this year Dj Mag ranks Club Octagon in Gangnam as the fifth best night club in the entire world . In the city regions Gangnam, Hongdae and Itaewon in particular, both foreigners and locals can easily find bars and clubs of various sizes that offer highquality entertainment and which conform to a relatively broad spectrum of tastes in music and dress style.Cultural characteristics Contempory South Korean culture can be described as a hybrid of Korean, East Asian and Western culture. As I have stated above, South Korea has been influenced by Japan and the US in particular to a significant extent. This means that the similar, real or quasihierarchical structures as in for instance China and Japan are visible in South Korea too. One is expected to speak and behave in different ways, depending on a persons age or social rank which are more or less explicitly stated.This does largely overlap a meritocratic social structure, rather than status being a primarily inherited factor. A doctor is looked upon as socially more valuable than a regular office worker, regardless of family background. It is thus not much left of the old Confucian system.The Korean languageeven though about 60 of the words are based on Chinese words, and its grammar being partly similar to Japaneseis unique with all its different suffixes that in turn conform to different speech and writing levels. These can be more or less formal, plain and polite but are always related to the social relations and contexts of either speaking or writing. People who know each other well tend to use an intimate speech style Haeche, but in some contexts, such as the workplace, they might change to a more formal and polite level Haeyoche when they walk to other people. Many who learn Korean at a beginners level start with Haeyoche and then gradually broaden the scope to include other levels of speaking and writing.Apart from the Korean language, a foreigner may find many things in South Korea that are either similar to places such as Japan and Hong Kong, or to the Western world. South Korea, especially Seoul, is largely the product of globalization and as a wealthy country this goes along with high standards of infrastructure and general quality of life. As a hightech nation it appears as being in the forefront of material development, often outshining its Western counterparts, at least in some ways.The present culture, especially the more youthoriented culture, is safe and relaxed. Only slight modifications in dress and behavior towards more politeness and moderation makes any Westerner fit in well, at least short termwise, and to only speak English is seldom a real obstacle.If a person digs deeper into Korean history and cultureand geographically move outside the Seoul metropolitan areaone may find many differentiating and even somewhat unique characteristics although these do often have China as its root or point of departure, but apart from Buddhismwhich is separated rather than integrated into the larger societythese elements are seldom manifested in present time. There are obviously many real Buddhists and Christians in present South Korea, but the traditional layers of culture tend to be mere relics of the past. With that said, the country as a whole is overall more socially conservative than many Western counterparts.Whether or not the trend towards increased westernization will continue remains an open question, but in terms of technology and popular culture it is unlikely that South Korea will look in other directions in the near future. After all, much of its present infrastructure and popular culture makes it into pretty much a local version of the Westernglobal society.Lastly, two other things that have direct implications for any foreign person who reflects upon the option to stay longer in South Korea than as a tourist, temporary employee or exchange student, is that 1 the population is very homogeneous, and 2 it has no explicit will to change this fact.This means that it is difficult, although not totally impossible, to obtain a citizenship if you are not of Korean descent. South Korea uses a type of partial jas sanguinis , citizenship by the blood. It is not very uncommon these days that Korean men get married to and have children with for instance Southeast Asian women, such as Filipinas, and South Korea is gradually shifting towards a more multiethnic society. However, compared to many Western countries the levels of ethnic and genetic heterogeneity are much, much smaller.Due to the legal difficulties and cultural differences, especially languagewise, it is definitely not a smooth process to become naturalized as a Korean citizen or resident. Permanent and temporary living are generally two very different things and South Korea is yet another palpable manifestation of that.Women in South Korea Phenotypically, South Korean women are similar to those of other East Asian populations. As a result of drastically improved nutrition, younger South Koreans are relatively tall, seemingly not much shorter on average than their Western counterparts. The levels of obesity are slightly rising but still very low compared to the US, Canada and even thinner European countries such as Italy and Sweden. Overall, Korean femalesespecially girlscan be characterized as moderately tall and slim.Additionally, a significant share cares a lot about their appearances. Fashion, diet, hair style and makeup are all very important in everyday life, and although these things change rapidly due to new trends and seasonal shifts, many will ride along the same wave wherever it goes. Collectivism is quite striking in that respect, and subcultures are not as widespread and visible as in Japan. Many look about the same.As with many phenomena in life, the extent to which a person likes or dislikes how a population generally appears is related to individual taste. With that said, I think that more objectively speaking the two main strengths of Korean girls and younger women are that they are relatively thin and wellgroomed. They do everything they can to optimize their beauty potentials, sometimes even with the help of plastic surgery which will make them look somewhat more European, which partly is an ideal among East Asian populations.Additionallyeven if this stems more from observations and anecdotes than general factsthey tend to be more polite and welleducated, in a positive sense, than Western females. This is something they also have in common with other well off Asians, such as Japanese, Taiwanese, and Singaporeans. In the more exciting locations of Seoul, one will find quite many pretty and decent Korean girls, and even though hookup culture has for good and for bad penetrated the south of the Korean peninsula, a significant share of these females may be looked upon as serious girlfriend material.Western guys do have a comparative advantage in terms of looks and even sometimes behavior Korean guys tend to lack the cockiness of Westerners, but these automatic benefits should not be overemphasized. Many of the things that girls are attracted to, such as confidence, extroversion and good looks are general, close to universal traits. If one is a loser in the West then one will probably be that in the East as well. Conversely, the more alpha males will magnify their results if they have the proper time and opportunity to do so.Conclusion Overall South Korea is a rather impressive modern society that shares many of the good features with its equally rich neighbors. However, recently it has seemingly surpassed places like Japan and Hong Kong in terms of material development, nightlife and popular culture. For some Western males, between the ages of 2035, South Korea might offer a valuable opportunity for temporaryranging from weeks to even years and circular migration. Because eventually it is most likely time to go home, regardless if one wishes it or not.Read More How To Get Laid In South Korea ",hate
"  Men Are Binded By Their Shared Realization Of Truth Men Are Binded By Their Shared Realization Of Truth Andr is a young European who left his decaying country in 2012 for greener pastures. He enjoys exploring subterranean places, reading about a host of interconnected topics, and yearns for Tradition. November 18, 2016 Politics The 9 th of November 2016 was a great day. We will remember it as well as our parents remember the first moon landing in July 1969 or the fall of the Berlin wall. Liberal mainstream mediaalmost a pleonasmare either stunned or agitating. Some of these crybullies clamour to themselves how fearful they are, lament on the destruction of the Westa curious expression as it seldom appears under leftist pensor have difficulties to acknowledge that the man they have despised and defamed every day for months will be the 45 th President of the United States. Outside the US, The Donalds victory is creating waves, too. So many liberals allegedly connected to the Canadian Immigration website to crash it. In France, the bourgeois bohemians who work in the media, academia and everything that constitutes the big left establishment do the same posturing than their American counterparts, whereas the petits blancs impoverished, disenfranchised whites and local righters rejoice. In Brazil, where your humble servant lives, the official media is making some tedious comments that deliver a flabby criticism. Local leftist talking heads condemn the  white protestants  and reality shows in a very clich posturing that mixes antiwhite prejudice with a critique of capitalism, whereas some new traditionalists, among whom some have been avid readers and makers of AltRight content, are grateful . This is our victory. Feels good, man A proPepe Facebook group has had a substantive discussion about where a redpilled foreigner considering moving to the US after the Donald won should go. To make a long story short, some have advised potential newcomers to go live in the Midwest, in Texas as long as one stays away from Houston or Dallas, in Wyoming for the gun rights, in Pennsylvania excluding Philadelphia and the urban areas, close to the Appalachian mountains if one enjoys outdoors, while staying away from Illinois. Most of those who participated were whites, but I have spotted some Latino and Arab names. Some made jokes on these names but no fuss. And here the following question arises. What defines us Liberals have been shrieking about xenophobia or racism all the time. Yet, strictly national boundaries are much less relevant than before, even for us , even when we all rejoiced about Trumps promise to make a wall. All over the world we are rejoicing around the GOP candidates victory. American Trumpists undoubtedly feel closer to nonAmericans who have been dissenting from the NWO on the Internet and wanted the Donald to pass than to American libtards. A lot of us are OK with having nonwhites around we dont pander to arrogant, aggressive antiwhites, but that does not mean we would have to be racists as the liberal caricature wants us to be. To cut in more personally, I know of no genuine redpilled or AltRighter who would have rejected me as a frog, although I remember some stars and stripes cucks blaming me for daring to speak about American politics without owning a US passport. The frog is green after all So, once again, what defines us Why are we a we Race plays a role for sure. We struggle to keep the white people from getting dissolved into the acid bath of widescale miscegenation and dispossession. We want a right to solidarity based at least partly on race, i.e. on lineage and identity, just like all the pseudominority groups out there. We fight the double standard that allows them to be communitarian, tribalistic, nepotistic, without being ever responsible of what they do, whereas we are supposed to keep our heads down and be taught everything by liberal social engineers in a world where we would have no freedom, no future, no dignity. But even then, there have been Blacks, Latinos , and many women who participated into bringing The Donald to the White House. I have a racemixed friend who supported Trump all along. This is not to say Im not a racist, afraid cuckservativestyle, but to show there are some and we know it firsthand. It is no mystery why most of us are white we are united around a civilization that was primarily built by people of European descent. But there is more, too. And this more that, I think, defines and binds us this more is shared awareness . On the periphery of the System centers, we managed to grow and gather We are all aware, broadly speaking, of the same phenomena and trends. We have witnessed the breakup of families and harmonious relationships between men and women. We have been faced with the untold prohibition to make the least critic of feminism, minority groups aggressive identitarianism, and with the pervasive omnipresence of these leftist norms commonly referred to as political correctness. We have seen neoliberalism allowing a handful of careless, irresponsible assholes sending the jobs overseas, importing thirdworld immigration, then force us into a life of chronic unemployment or endless struggles against other lowwage individuals for a small place under the sun. We saw how conservatism was a sham that never faced the genuine problems. We witnessed societies crumble, conflictual minoritarian group identities being crafted by the likes of Soros, and the meritorious worker or professionalwhatever his racegetting exploited to the benefit of the lower and upper parasites. We saw the liberal establishment using various social categories like pawns to create horizontal struggles and depopulation . Of course, some disagreements can be found on this or that particular issue, but we all see the same devastated landscape in lieu of the brilliant civilization the West once was. And here is the major fault line. The leftists deny or value they often go from the former to the latterthe replacement of native European population, the aggressive and tribalistic stance of minority groups towards the silent majority, the forced inclusion of individuals into sick identity politics games, the perpetual hostility and institutionalized prejudice against whites and males Either the leftists utterly deny what we are aware of, for example when they say that whites are not under replacement, or they demonize it as a remnant of some privilege or prejudice. All their talk about oppressed minorities dissimulates the very real disenfranchisement of the white majority, of nonwhite meritorious and integrated Westerners, and serves to deny us from our rights to public empathy, to dignity, or to even basically survive in a world of our own. They work on language and representations because their job consists in manipulating these, thus brainwashing us into seeing the world through their lenses and denying the legitimacy of any other vision. The importance of shared awareness explains why we united on the Internet. A lot of us were closet nationalists years ago, and still are. We could not, and often still cannot, be nationalists in public, or we would have been excluded from normal social life by the local leftists and cowards. Leftist hegemony was and is still real in the mainstream. You know hegemony when you see it and spend countless hours thinking about how you can thrive even when living under it. In the mid2000, I found out about the information website Fdesouche Native French quote. By the standards of today, this news aggregator seems hardly interesting it mostly collates pieces written by others. But then, it was fantastic. Here I could recognize what I already felt about the worldthat something was wrong with all these nonwhites thugs holding the streets and getting lavish promotion when they bragged about it. It was all concentrated before my eyes, and others were talking about what they went through daily as well. At least, others felt and saw the same as I did I was not crazy, not bound to a life of unauthenticity or forlorn solitude among the almighty left. We were assembling. And we were on the Internet. Fdesouche.comThe website they want to keep you from visiting As most of us found ourselves under attack from nonnative Frenchmen, and knowing intuitively that identity goes deeper than the fleeting winds today called culture, we often despised immigration in general. But eventually things changed, thanks to Alain Soral , mostly, who emphasized how racial struggle was leading to sterile battles among disenfranchised people while letting the truly powerful off the hook. Mathias Cardet, a black journalist who worked with Soral, showed how gangstarap culture was injected and nurtured among nonwhites by powerful interests. After all, one can be black or Arab and wanting to live in peace as a free individual, not as an identity politics pawn who spends his life attacking another social category. Being prowhite, promasculinity and protradition does not require being white I often felt closer from Muslims with good intentions, i.e. Muslims who were genuine believers and not rancorous people using Islam as a mask for antiwhite tribalism, than from white liberals. The Muslims would not share my blood, but they would share some of my awareness and yearning for Tradition, two things that white liberals eagerly reject. Faith front, warriors alliance against common foes The Internet is immaterial. It is, basically, a network where information flows. Awareness, and the will to spread it, are immaterial as well. This is why we could meet and act on the Internet. After all, the Alt Right and manosphere have been sharing ideas, media contents, memes, advisesand only later proceeded to meetups, panicking the totalitarian liberals in the process. Trumps victory is a major one. Regardless of what The Donald will actually do, it is an event of considerable historical magnitude. But it is only the beginningmake no mistake about that. The libtards establishment still holds loads of money, of institutions, of cultural territory. It has started to crumble and leak , yet it is still there. Major battles are waiting ahead. We have to further our awareness, make thorough research on every aspect of leftism, and develop more proper cultural references. Always remember the libtards never cared one second about us. They would have let us die off, alone, poor, childless, traumatized and demonized, had we not chosen to follow the path of the red pill. America is a firsttier power, but it is still a battlefield among others. Wherever we are, it is time to thicken our mutual relationships and cooperate more closely. It is a battle, not between nationals and foreigners, but between workers and parasites, between those who feel the void and wrongness in the rotten core of postmodernity and those who dwell in the last liberal trend, between the realists who want freedom and responsibility in a healthy world of values and cultures against those who ravel in blue pill, media bullshit, complacency, parasitism and cucking for the empire of nothing. We are the future. It doesnt matter where we are. We are those with true awareness, those with genuine and healthy values, those who struggled to hone their abilities, and most importantly those who actually deserve to inherit the Western world. So, save it and conquer it, country after country, institution after institution, outlet after outletor there will be nothing left.",hate
"Suppose you are one of those adventurous Americans who meets and marries a beautiful foreign woman. You are the envy of all your friends. What nextYou can bring her back home to the United States or Europe. The guys will be jealous, the women will feel threatened. And your bride will be a fish out of waterfor a while. But it doesnt take them long to get established. She will find a group of her countrywomen, other Thais, Vietnamese or Ukrainians. They will teach her the ropes. Where to go shopping for the kind of groceries she needs. The most efficient way to send money to her relatives back home. Where her fellow countrymen hang out. And, oh yes They will also learn American culture. Their friends will explain about American men and American divorce law. And that is where the trouble starts.My Vietnamese war bride, an upscale Frenchified thing, informed me after just over a year of marriage, after I had helped her family escape Saigon, that A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle. When the inevitable the divorce came she refused a reasonable settlement offer and hired a junkyard dog lawyer to fight it in court. Losing, she was shocked to discover that that offer was off the table.Keep your woman in her own country, where she is comfortable and where the culture is more likely to appreciate men. You make the adjustment to her culture instead of vice versa. Why American culture is about the most poisonous in the world. Almost anything is better. Countries that havent been indoctrinated in feminism and cultural Marxism still value children and respect a womans role in bearing them and raising them. They also respect a mans role as the breadwinner and head of the family.I committed myself to Ukraine nine years ago, met my wife seven years ago and our son appeared five years ago. It is worth enumerating the many ways in which it is a pleasure to be living with her and raising him in Kyiv instead of the USA.1. Kyiv is a beautiful and lively city Beautiful architecture  Andreevska ChurchKyiv is a worthy capital city. It has millenniumlong history studded with cathedrals and other exquisitely crafted monuments. There are many, many targets for a tourist camera. The walled city was built to be defensible, situated atop a steep bluff on the right bank of the Dnieper River close to where the Desno River joins from the east, 20 miles south of where another major tributary, the Pripyat, flows in from the west. From their capital in Kyiv the Viking princes could easily sally out in their long boats to the Black Sea or anywhere in Western Russia.The sandy river beaches are good for swimming from June to September and for fishing any time it isnt frozen. One can rent kayaks and rowboats or take a river cruise in the warmer months. When it does freeze it is dotted with ice fishermen. All it takes is a saw, some bait, a line and the antifreeze of ones choice. There are bicycle paths along the river and on the islands in the middle of the river. The city is experiencing a surge in the number of bicycle commuters.The Soviet system had its good points. They housed everybody in highrise apartments. It may not be as attractive as detached houses, but it makes for a very compact city. Those people needed places to breathe and exercise, so the city is full of parks. As compact as Kyiv is, it is, with most people living in apartment blocks, it easy to get around. Every place in the city is within walking distance of a convenience store of some sort, and restaurants and shopping centers are usually within a walk or a short bus ride.Young people the world over want to live in the city, and Kyiv is no exception. It has lots of bars, cafs and nightclubs. The trends are toward sushi and Italian food. Ukraine is traditional enough that young people even go to church. There are Orthodox churches in every neighborhood, and a handful of Englishspeaking congregations scattered throughout the city.Kyiv is home to Ukraines most famous universities, Shevchenko University, KyivMohyla Academy and Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. These are their Harvard, Yale and MIT  an extraordinarily high percentage of business and government leaders have graduated from them. They know each other. As in the United States, just being admitted to these universities is a sign of intelligence and talent. For a foreigner, getting to know these elites is a lot easier than getting to know Ivy Leaguers in the United States.2. Ukraine is extremely affordable Attractive, inexpensive traditional markets and supermarkets, of courseKyiv is a very inexpensive place to live very bottom of the Big Mac Index. The hryvnya exchange rate has fallen threefold since the start of the war in Donbass. Prices have risen, especially for imports, but not nearly as much. The tourist will note that it is still possible to get a decent hotel room for 30, a taxi anywhere in the city for 10 and a meal for under 10. That is just the start.For those of us who live here, 16 Metro ridesbuses and trams are even lessmake life cheap and convenient. Try the grocery store10 a pound for potatoes, beets, carrots, onions and cabbage, the staples of the Ukrainian diet. Meat is generally under two dollars a pound. Although there is a lot of hue and cry about corruption in the energy business, in the end it costs far less than in the United States 100 a month to heat a house and between four and five dollars a gallon for gasoline. However, most Ukrainians utilities are included in rent, and only a few drive cars.Medical care is a preview of the impending Obamacare disaster. The state promises the moon but delivers only what it can afford. The average Ukrainian has to stand in a long line to get indifferent service from underequipped and underpaid doctors in shabby, Soviet era hospitals. The flip side is that feeforservice is alive and well. You can get decent care if you pay for it and it doesnt cost very much. In fact, Ukraine is a medical tourism destination, especially for fertility treatments, plastic surgery and dental work.An American Social Security check makes you rich by local standards. It is a good place to live in retirement. Moreover, any American can teach English, and there are a number of entrepreneurial opportunities that dont take a lot of capital to start.3. Ukrainians are fairly uniformly Slavic  and they like people like themselves Just us SlavsWestern newspapers are full of horror stories about Ukraine  war and corruption. Leaders in Moscow, Washington and Europe love to point fingers at us to distract from the increasingly blatant corruption surrounding those in the West. Im no fan of corruption, but given the fact that it is universal, it is worth relating why Ukrainian corruption is more comfortable to live with than that of the Europe or the United States.There is no hypocrisy about our corruption. Or, rather, the hypocrisy is so transparent that nobody believes the lies. The virtue We still have free speech. Ukrainians do not lose their jobs if they are politically incorrect. They are not jailed if they say what they think about Middle Eastern immigration. If you tell a woman she looks good, she might actually blush and appreciate it.The corruption has kept the standard of living low, which, perversely, has important benefits. People remain traditional because they have needed the support of families just to survive. Asylum seeking immigrants dont come because there is nothing here for themfew jobs and nothing in the way of welfare.Not having immigrants leads to high levels of social capital. The people actually like and trust each other. I am the only American in our little development of 3000 homes. They have included me in the groupeverybody knows me and says hello when I meet them on the street, in the bus and in the stores. In my toney neighborhood of Bethesda, Maryland, most neighbors were too occupied with their important jobs to bother being neighborly.The fact that it is mostly just Slavs has a couple of important corollaries. There are no bad neighborhoods in Kyiv. People will tell you to avoid the Troyeshchena, but a lot of people I know live there. I went to see for myself. I had a couple of pleasant shots of vodka chatting with the locals. I cannot imagine doing that in the Anacostia neighborhood of Washington DC.People always stand up to give my son and me a seat on the bus or Metro. Old ladies absolutely gush over him, and engage him in small talk. They support their rising generation, and are tickled to death that I am raising him to be a Ukrainian.Lastly, even though the locals will tell you otherwise, Ukrainians are good and polite drivers. They invariably stop for you at crosswalks. Very few will drive after even one drink. Fatalities per vehicle mile are about twice as high as in the West because the roads are poor, but you cant blame it on the drivers.4. Young people have pride in themselves An English language Toastmasters meetingStudents and young professionals show selfrestraint no tattoos, no piercings, no sloppy clothes, no swearing, very little smoking and no drugs. They are what in the 1950s was called squaredelightfully so. They look forward to marriage and families, especially the women. For this reason they are perhaps not as easy as girls elsewhere, but when you get one, you have something of substance.There are lots of places to meet young people. Needless to say, bars and nightclubs. There are studios all over town giving inexpensive dance lessonssalsa and swing are bigand hundreds of sports clubs. The English language Mafia club is thriving. The Toastmasters public speaking club attracts many of the best and brightest with meetings in English, German, Russian and Ukrainian. The Language Exchange club also meets in several languages. From May to September, the river beaches are great, surrounded by restaurants, bars and discos.Ukrainians love to practice their English and welcome foreigners. Not too many make it this far east. It is an easy place to make friends.5. It is a good place to sit out the Wests coming civil unrest One of Kyivs many lovely river beachesThe Western press would have you believe that Kyiv is a lawless Wild West. That is the opposite from the truth  even today it is safer than any Western capital city.The first danger cited is Vladimir Putin. When are the Russians going to invade Answer they wont. Throughout is history Russia has expanded by stealth and opportunity. They stopped when Finland fought back in 1939 and Georgia fought back in 2008. They swiped the Baltics and part of Poland only after Germany had started a war that diverted the worlds attention. They imposed their will on their European satellites only because the Red Army conveniently occupied them at the end of World War II.In Ukraine, they took the opportunity of political chaos in 2014 to steal Crimea, where by treaty they already had a large military presence. Emboldened, they thought they had an opportunity in the Russianspeaking Donbass. But the Ukrainians resisted, and that war is at a standstill. Putin knows full well that 80 million ethnic Russians cannot dominate 40 million ethnic Ukrainians, especially under the glare of world opinion. Despite what the neocons may have shouted to sway the US election, the Russians are not coming. Another comforting thought is that there is nothing here worth nuking. It is a benefit of staying out of NATO.There is no dependent class here to rise up when economic hardship hits. Hardship is already here. There are no discontented minorities. Gypsies, the most visible of them, actually workthey sell flowers and work as junk dealers. You cannot be a parasite if there is no blood to suck. It is the United States and Europe that have legions of restless unemployed who are only being pacified by government benefits. and will rise up when governments can no longer afford them.Ukraines corruption is well understood by everybody. As much as they complain, people know how to cope with it. It may take bribery to get things done, but they generally do get done. Corruption does not result in much violence. Occasionally some hardnosed judge or a pesky reporter gets bumped off, true, but in every case the victim could have explained quite clearly why he was targeted. It is not like the random killing of whites by blacks in the United States or random Islamic terror in Western Europe.Ukraine has lots of land, excellent agriculture, abundant water, reasonably good natural resources, and a homogeneous and hardworking population. It is not as dependent on international trade as most European countries. When the world financial system collapses, Ukraine will come through looking pretty good. They are so far down that it all looks like up, and the stress lines for civil unrest simply dont exist. Though you may come here for the love of a wonderful woman, you will find it a delightful place to make your home.Read More Ukrainian Girls Have Lost Their Love For American Men ",hate
"With her Hollywood and silver screen career options all but dried up, former Charmed actress and constantly nearnaked attentionseeker Rose McGowan is now a leading feminist. As you would expect, this transition occurred after her looks which never approached those of costar Alyssa Milano had well and truly begun to fade. McGowan is not alone in making this spectacular shift. Pamela Anderson and professional SJW Natasha Devon are among a growing crowd of women who rail against sexism and objectification after years of trying, often very successfully, to sexualize their youth.Seeking to cash in on her newfound fame as an unhinged SJW, Rose McGowan launched the Rose Army, a kind of personal cult that tries to hide the overt narcissism of its creator by supporting campaigns against domestic violence and female objectification. Full SJW mode is just a button away for her. For instance, she attacked gays for not being feminist enough and, probably projecting her jealousy over not landing a significant acting role for an eternity, claimed an XMen movie poster promoted violence against women .So now comes the task of reconciling the new Rose McGowan with the old one, whose selfobjectification is best described by this infamous photo with exboyfriend Marilyn MansonExcuses, excuses Rose McGowan has tried to gloss over her past history of selfobjectification and sexualization by saying she was merely a pawn of the patriarchy.McGowan is now even blaming her past personal feuds, such as with a fellow Charmed actress, Shannen Doherty, on patriarchy, sexism and female objectification . Sadly, this very public attentionseeking, in which McGowan wrote Doherty an open letter, comes at the same time that the latter is suffering from cancer . But, you know, a girls gotta attentionwhore, including when another girl she used to have catfights with is about to die.Rose McGowan has a lot in common with Pamela Anderson. Ex Playboy cover model Anderson, after an entire career made from taking her clothes off and otherwise selling her body as if she were competing for a championship, has now come out against pornography . She may not be bad for a gal nearing 50, but her best years are a good 2025 years behind her. I would wager that Pamela Anderson hit 45 and spent the last several years in denial, before she decided to lambaste an industry currently lauding nubile girls in their twenties and not her. Pornography addictions are bad, but Anderson showing these new colors in 2016 is nothing short of a joke.Andersons position can be summed up by the following two picturesTime when she did not condemn pornography Time when she condemns pornography Previously, a lot of attention has been paid to fat or unattractive girls being feminists. These activists are nominally against the sexualization of women, but appear to be driven primarily by envy and the need to diminish societys praise of attractive females. Whilst there is a lot of truth to this, it only tells part of the story. The rank opportunism of feminism is perhaps better explained by women who once made a career from selling their appearances and have subsequently turned on the industries whose financial teats they used to suckle. And what better time to turn on these industries, whether they be the pornography, film, or modeling markets, than when your looks no longer allow you to actively participate in themThis phenomenon runs parallel to female athletes both utilizing and complaining about their sexualization . Attractive tennis players like Sabine Lisicki and unattractive ones like Serena Williams have made careers out of wearing revealing oncourt clothing, which is much more for show than practicality. But when the chance presents itself, Lisicki and others have moaned, like at this years Wimbledon , about how manufacturers designs make them show too much skin. Many of these girls may not have lost their attractiveness yet, but they pick and choose when objectification is bad, just like celebrities whose looks have abandoned them.Its not just famous people Natasha Devon.Many Return Of Kings readers will remember Natasha Devon from her awful performance against Milo Yiannopoulos during a British Sky News debate on fashion mannequins. There seems to have been an eerie timing in Devons transition from selfdescribed former model to SJW. She founded a socalled body image education program in 2006, in her midtwenties. I dont know about you, but this seems to be the sort of age when nonfamous models in particular face the meat grinder due to competition from younger, fresher girls.As she hurtled towards 30, Natasha Devon penned an article for Cosmopolitan magazine on bulimia, which morphed into a regular monthly column. Then came The SelfEsteem Team Devon created in 2012. Frequently with government funding, The SelfEsteem Team has essentially applauded obesity, Britains number one health crisis, and sought to reengineer what humans are programmed by evolution to find attractive.Devon, along with Anderson and McGowan, may chalk an antiobjectification epiphany down to age, experience or something similarly convenient, but the changes happened neither at the height of their selfsexualization careers nor during the prewall protracted slide. Always be on the look out for when exactly a woman took up feminist or general SJW activism.When a woman complains about the objectification of women, it usually means a she never had the goods to begin with, b her goods werent enough to compete with other girls, or c her goods are well and truly gone. There is a delicious irony to option c, as countless women will milk their looks until natureor a halfdecade of alcohol or drugfueled benderstakes them away.Feminism as projection It is par for the course in todays political climate that our enemies describe us as sad mommas boys who play out failed encounters with women through our beliefs. Of anyone, Roosh has faced this entirely baseless criticism the most, all because our opponents have been unable to actually refute what he and Return Of Kings say.We need to turn this idea of projection against feminists, even more than we have before. Modernday feminism is itself the domain of women seeking easy comforts from an ideology that explains away either their own faults or their most primal fears about a harsh, uncertain world. For women whose looks are now washedup, feminism enables them to label objectification as wrong and soothe the crushing blows that come from no longer getting the attention they were used to.Rather than seeing these women as twisted and evil, it is better to perceive the behavior for what it is desperation and the shocking realization that they are sexually irrelevant.Read More Female Danish Athletes Diminish Their Own Championship Victory By Taking Nude Photos ",hate
"Every man who supports Donald Trump came to it from a different path. Some of you support him because of economic impoverishment or because you have seen your neighborhoods degrade from illegal immigrants . Or maybe you support him because you were attacked for being politically incorrect. For me and many other men, we came to support Trump because we shared truths about sex and the true nature of women .The fight began in 2012 with the Southern Poverty Law Center In March 2012, after years of teaching men how to improve their sex lives through books and web sites , I was put on a list by the Jewishoperated Southern Poverty Law Center for being a misogynist . I was shaken up by this because I knew that my desire to enjoy sex with beautiful women and share the truths Ive learned from it put me on a path of no return. Either I close down shop immediately or accept that the mob would one day come pounding on my door.I decided to keep going. I responded to the SPLC designation with an article titled My Existence Is Becoming Illegal , where I described how heterosexual sex was now a defiant political act if the male received any benefit from it.It is clear that gender hate is now a oneway street. Men can hate women but not the other way around. Men can rape, women cant. Men can be abusive, both physically and emotionally, but women cant. Men can be misogynist, but women cant be misandrist, a word that is unknown to most of the American population. Men can be described as lazy slobs who play video games all day, but women are perfect asis in a country where there are organizations trying to convince you that being fat is both healthy and beautiful. Male teachers get sent to poundmeintheass prison if they have sex with a student, but female teachers only get a slap on the wrist. If youre a man, youre likely a perpetrator of hate, violence, and abuse to innocent American women, even if you dont yet realize your thought crime, but never the other way around.Fast forward two years to October 2014. Witch hunts by leftists were in force. Rage mobs were crawling through social networking looking for racists, homophobes, and sexists with the aim of getting them fired. I studied the people who were participating in these witch hunts and wrote one of the most important articles Ive ever published What Is A Social Justice Warrior SJW The article was widely shared, influencing how people viewed the useful idiot layer of individuals who were guided and controlled by establishment forces consisting of academia, the corporate news media, Hollywood, Fortune 500 companies, Silicon Valley, and the billionaire owners of our politicians. Scratch a feminist SJW and youll find the reptilian skin of a billionaire who created the narrative she believes.I was pessimistic when I wrote the SJW article, thinking wed need a full generation 25 years to even begin defeating such a powerful antiAmerican entity . I focused on teaching men selfdefense and avoidance instead of ways to defeat them. Little did I know that I was defining them at their absolute peak, and barely two years later a candidate who stood for the diametric opposite of social justice would win the presidency. The social justice warriors havent gone away, and they are rushing to fulfill the will of George Soros by refusing to accept the results of a fair election, but the power they have to force people to bend to their demands has been reduced, along with the power of the institutions that support them.Though SJWism peaked in 2014, I had to face the full brunt of their attacks in the summer of 2015 during the Canadian stops of my lecture tour and again in February 2016 during the international meetups . I survived those attacks, and the fact that Im still here right now and able to exercise my free speech on all my platformswhile youre still here participatingshows clearly how little power they really had to stop us. They bruised me during the meetup outrage, but I healed quickly enough to weaponize my sites to spread my support of an even bigger enemy of theirs, Donald Trump.Donald Trump ground zero Im a pessimist by nature, so I didnt have much hope that the establishment would allow Trump to win in the primaries, even though I was confident his ideas resonated with most Americans. But then I noticed that he simply couldnt be knocked out, no matter what his enemies did. I saw him humiliate Jeb Bush , outcompete a resurgent Ted Cruz, and smack down any attempt by the media to force him to display weakness. By the time I attended the Republican National Convention in Cleveland , I started to believe.The ground zero for Donald Trump within the manosphere was The Donald Trump thread on the forum, created in June 2015 by veteran member and ROK contributor Samseau . This is where the battle unfolded for thosuands of men. Over 2,000 pages long, the thread has been viewed nearly 6 million times. Ideas within it have filtered out into mainstream discourse, as described here , to men with bullhorns larger than I have.After significant battles in a real war, medals are awarded but soldiers dont nitpick on who was the best soldier. They all worked as a team to ensure victory, from the General Donald Trump, the Colonels his advisers, the Captains major media influencers like Alex Jones, Matt Drudge, Paul Joseph Watson, and Mike Cernovich, the Sergeants men like myself, the Specialists men like Samseau, and on down to the Private, a regular commenter who contributes the occasional meme or argument in his spare time.The ego cares about how impactful one is, how influential its ideas are, but the team player only cares about victory for the whole. Whether I am a Private or a Sergeant, I fought side by side with men in that thread and on this web site to what amounts to a modern fourthgenerational informational war that will be studied by historians in the future. Who would have guessed that public internet sites operating on free opensource software would have such a positive effect on not just the result of the election, but on the lives of so many men who participated in it.Approaching the date of the election Two months before the election, I did a Youtube video urging men to vote for Trump , and it resulted in nearly 150 unsubscribes within a day, surprising even me since I thought my audience was mostly men who would automatically support a Trump presidency. The video echoed a lot of sentiments I shared in the article If Donald Trump Doesnt Win, Were Screwed , where I tried to convey the danger of a Hillary presidency.Obama was the race president, and look how badly he has damaged race relations in only eight years. Hillary will be the gender president. The future we have in store should be absolutely clear to you if she happens to defeat Trump.Not only will she move to establish a technomatriarchy where men are secondclass citizens to any female, but she will ensure that no movement or organization will be able to challenge her or her establishment cronies ever again. This isnt a trivial matter of getting banned from a web site like Twitter or Youtubemany of you will be forced to escape the country for no other reason than you happening to be a man who found himself on the wrong side of the establishment.For the next month, I stared at the calendar, waiting for the election to happen, doing what I could to push back against the narrative on Twitter . Then in early October, an old tape was released of Trump saying he grabs girls by the pussy because they let him. My sister called me, confused, and asked if he really was a bad man. I told her that the media is distorting his comments just like they distorted mine a few months earlier when their proclaimed me as a  prorape advocate . I told her not to believe the media and to judge Trump by his actions and his policies, not a gotcha moment that was being spun out of control to help Hillarys failing campaign.I spoke to her with confidence, but inside I was concerned in a politically correct world, would this be the blow to sink Trumps candidacy Is the majority of Americans actually ready to defeat political correctness Thankfully, Trump responded strongly, ignoring calls by the traitors in the Republican party to step down.The first poll to come in after pussygate suggested that Trumps support didnt decline. The fake controversy didnt work. I held my breath for the next few days to see if another tape would come out, maybe of him saying the nword, but none did, and I knew the establishment had no more bullets. This was the moment where I finally believed. I felt a rush of energy on that day as my subconscious accepted that Trump was going to win. I did a Periscope that night as if I was amped up on methamphetamine, but I took no drug.From that point on it was just a matter of hanging on, until finally on November 8 when he was elected President. I was in disbelief after he won because it was only four years prior when I was attacked by the same forces that were aligned against Trump. I didnt have to wait long until my personal enemies were dealt a monstrous defeat by another man whom I consider on the same team as us. If I made any miscalculation, it was that it would take a generation or longer for us to begin pushing back against establishment forces. I underestimated our own power, and those of our allies in the alternative internet space.Human control is a foolhardy endeavor The most important lesson I learned from Trumps victory is how pointless it is to control human beings, both their behaviors and their minds. Every single major institution in the United States, represented by billions of dollars of economic activity and influence, could not stop a populist candidate, in spite of trying everything short of assassination.George Soros and his billions werent effective. Obama and his allies werent effective. The mainstream media and their dozens of outlets werent effective. CEOs of the biggest companies in the United States werent effective. Hollywood and its superstars werent effective. Academia and its thousands of professors werent effective. Social media and its censorship efforts werent effective. The FBI allowing Hillary to skate from real crimes wasnt effective. Even Donald Trumps own party wasnt effective in stopping him. Its absolutely incredible that all these forces couldnt stop one man and his believers. What a disgrace to the fields of scientific management and modern propaganda for them all to fail so miserablyThink right now of how much effort the antiTrump forces put into stopping him from winning. Think of how much money they spent to guarantee their desired outcome. And now think how it was all for nothing . They accomplished the very opposite of what they moved mountains to accomplish, after decades of cementing their control within the country by sucking the truth and life blood from the American public.Whatever term you use to describe the force that governs our existencenature, God, Tao, or so onit is clear that humans cannot control it all, and that the pendulum will swing when it wants to swing, that the wheel of history will turn when it wants to turn, and your billions of dollars and your propaganda and your institutions can do nothing to stop it. Imagine how impotent George Soros and his friends must feel after their limitless money and influence was all for nothing.Now they have to perfect their control methods even more, open their pocket books further, and try to force their will upon a population as if pushing food into the mouth of someone who is already full. Their desire to control you is nothing but their own psychological failings of trying to alleviate their crippling fears, of trying to prove to themselves and to the world that they are a somebody, that they are powerful, that the world must be shaped into their image, that they are gods among men, but it should be clear to you by now that they are not gods but sociopaths who gamed an economic system to amass huge amounts of capital and money. Much of that will be flushed down the drain as they continue to fight and grasp their way to unequivocal defeat, or attempting to control those who do not want to be controlled.You can control human beings, but only temporarily and only some of them. At the end of the day, humans want to do what they want to do, and if you dont possess what they wish to buy, they will go to someone who does, no matter how much money you spend on your mechanisms of control. The more you control what does not want to be controlled, the more tension is created and then released in the great unraveling, of which we are currently living through. In previous eras, that tension resulted in victorious parades on the streets, but in our modern era, it is in the form of online celebrations with the use of tweets and memes.If you want to be a true leader of society, create an environment where humans can associate with whom they want, can freely engage in commerce, can create families, can live in safety, can search for the truth without interference, and can work and play and live according to their nature. Put stone walls blocking their righteous will and watch them be torn down. It may take a decade, it may take 100 years, but it will happen, and the contraptions you used to control them will reveal not your strength but your own pathetic weakness.Conclusion We are tired of being controlled. Leave us alone. We are tired of institutions that are obsessed with controlling us, of forcing us to believe in falsehoods, of programming us to hate our country, of pitting woman against man and black against white. Leave us alone Let men be men, and from that a new American renaissance will come forth. Men who are strong and good must be allowed to live their lives, and if you prevent us from doing so, we wont allow you to live yours. We will humiliate your useful idiots, we will destroy your institutions, we will lash out with more than just memes.Im afraid that those who stand against us are gearing up for even greater authoritarian control over us, but at least now we have our man in the White House who can join us in a fight that we have already been battling for many years. I cant wait to see where this fight takes us next.Read Next What Donald Trumps Victory Means For Men ",hate
"Were all about selfimprovement here at Return Of Kings. A man should always be seeking to improve himself in some fashion, and when he has achieved one goal, he should move onto the next one. In short, never rest on your laurels.Combining this desire for self improvement with the masculine independence and minimalist lifestyle that other writers on this fine website should inculcate in you a desire to improve yourself while being thrifty and relatively solitary. As this article deals with fitness, you know what Im going to say personal trainers, or at the very least, the ones at your average commercial gym, should be avoided at all costs. And while most longterm fitness enthusiasts and professionals will likely either train by themselves or have one of the few trainers that knows what hes doing, most of us have to train alone, especially beginners who have naught but common sense to light his path. But there is another option books Yes, books, that simple yet elegant method of transferring knowledge directly to its viewer. There are certainly plenty of books out there pertaining to the various fields of fitness and athletics. But the question remains how effective is a book in physical trainingAs an avid reader of fitnessrelated tomes and many others, but thats neither here nor there, I own many of these books. And I feel that their effectiveness can be judged by grouping them based on genre.Weight Lifting and Calisthenics When I first started getting into physical culture as a young teenager, I turned to the nearby commercial gym, as most tyros tend to. In that commercial gym, I quickly found myself being attached to a wellmeaning jackass who gave me a machineheavy program that, according to him, would develop strength, size and endurance. And like most naive young men, I followed him, developing none of those things, but lining the trainers pockets.Eventually, realizing that I had been lied to, I embarked on a search for enlightenment, coming to the various corners of the internet that deal in such interests. One of the first things that I came across were books that I have repeatedly referred to in these pages, and still consider to be some of the best writing on general fitness out therethe works of men such as Paul Wade and Pavel Tsatsouline. Upon reading books such as Power to the People and the Convict Condidtioning series, and using a bit of common sense, I deduced that these books were superior than the typical tomes on fitness that the commercial gyms would sell at the counter for a few reasonsOne, they advocated a physical philosophy of simplicity and purity. Rather than advocating a julienne of exercises their routines were efficient and targeted all muscles of the body. Two, the credentials of the men were a cut above the average writer as a maximum security convict and a Spetsnaz veteran respectively, I knew that these men needed to train their muscles to fighting trim for purposes of survival, rather than doing curls for the girls. And third, they referred to the strongmen of old like Maxick and Eugen Sandow, standing on the shoulders of giants and opening my eyes to the wider world of fitness writing, much of which I have further consumed.In general, I would argue that writing on weightlifting and calisthenics are the most effective books on fitness, as these are solitary activities, and the books are typically written by one man speaking to another man. Thus, the techniques there in are written to be easily understood and practiced by the user without a partner.Martial Arts As I have repeatedly stated on this website , martial arts in general should be taken with a massive grain of saltwhile Im not so stupid as to say theres no point in training any sort of refined fighting style because of adrenaline and yes I have seen this boneheaded argument made, I have also spent a substantial amount of time debunking the overly flowery and outright fictitious martial arts styles that many hack authors and filmmakers propagate, on my own website as well as my Youtube and Dailymotion channels. Sadly, thanks to martial arts being more or less an unregulated market in the United States, any clown has the full legal right to proclaim himself a master.With that being said, some martial arts books are effective, thoroughly explaining the proper mechanics of a move and/or explaining proper situations in how to use them. While I have a background in proper study, I have also utilized books to teach aspects of martial arts that I was not formally taughtsuch as grappling. And again, I sought out accomplished and legitimate fighters that were decorated in their field men like Farmer Burns  Lessons in Catch Wrestling and Physical Culture  and Masao Takahashi  Mastering Judo  wrote detailed and efficient books for fighting in the clinch, and I have also used Dr. Sang Kims books on Taekwondo such as Complete Kicking for learning some of the more exotic kicks that my own background didnt teach me. And of course I practiced on resisting opponents, some of whom had been wrestlers themselves and thus could shore up my technique.The most important thing to bear in mind when using a martial arts book is that you MUST practice these techniques against a bag/dummy at the VERY least, and preferably with a sparring partner that will put up a fight. And while this is also the case for any book on physical culture, I would argue that its the most important for martial artsnamely because martial arts techniques are, by definition, used in panic situations. In contrast, weightlifting is almost always done in a state of relative calmnessnot counting the fake screaming idiots use to pump themselves up.Mindset/Meditation/Etc Books such as the Kundalini Meditation Manual by Yogi Bhajan, which I have only recently started to use, are simultaneously the most simple and most complicated books on selfimprovement to use. They are simple because in very basic terms the advice they give is basically think really hard about something, but it is precisely that abstractness that can make them difficultmeditation is a nebulous concept for the best of us to grasp immediately, and in some ways changing ones mindset and behavior is the most difficult thing anybody can do.While I admittedly do not have the depth of knowledge in these that I do with the other two topics, I would say that these are hard to grasp but easy to practice once they have been grokked in the words of Anthony Burgess After all, every second of every day of your life will involve you utilizing your mindset. And thus, its difficulty lies in the original understanding.Conclusion Looking at these three broad genres of male selfimprovement books, we can see that they differ greatly in content, but, speaking from a position of experience, I can safely say that to a great extent they are effective, and they can teach you new things, but only if you get one of the relatively few books that arent written by armchair alpha males, and only if you diligently practice the information contained within them.Read More 4 Effective Fighting Techniques That Every Man Should Know ",hate

"  Why You Should Become a Minimalist Why You Should Become a Minimalist February 21, 2013 55 Comments Lifestyle The most abused word in the English language is need. If youre reading this post, I contend there is little that you actually need beyond what you currently possess. You have ample electricity to power your computer in a climatecontrolled environment, with running water and food in your wellstocked refrigerator. Why, then, do you always hear people talking about how they need more stuff Humans have a deeplyrooted drive to compete with each other, and advertisers capitalize on this impulse. Take a moment to picture the average person that you meet. What do they have to take pride in Buying the newest thing allows them to join the club of consumers, and for a fleeting moment to be measured on an equal playing field despite their personal shortcomings. The internal pain of their lifes problems dissipates for the split second they can boast superiority over everyone who doesnt have the same shiny widget. This conspicuous consumption creates a selffulfilling egoinvestment in the broken system. Although borrowing money for useless luxury purchases subjugates people into debt slavery, the mentality is If I paid 30,000 for this hunk of metal and Im working overtime to pay it off, it MUST be worth it  and so are other things that the commercials are telling me to buy. Quite literally, we are working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we dont need . If youre reading this blog, you are likely a male aged 2535 who wants to do one or more of the following quit your job, travel, explore a locationindependent income, get yourself in shape, take charge of a relationship, and learn valuable life skills. A minimalist mentality helps you do all of these things. Having fewer possessions forces you to properly place a higher value on experiences. This will make it safer and more fulfilling to travel because you are in touch with what truly makes you happy. If youre working on a side hustle or starting a business, the desire for needless possessions drains your disposable income levels and prevents you from taking risks. If my business fails, will I have to give up my car lease Preempt this loss aversion by having less to lose. If you want to move to a better city with a higher cost of living, having excess stuff sets a floor on how much rent youll pay to house your crap, and in turn how much you can spend on leisure activities. If youre a distractable person like me, removing visual noise from your area makes you more likely to create things with your mind, and less likely to fixate on your environment . Throwing or giving useless things away is a good first step, since possessions have a psychic weight that you may not realize until you rid yourself of them. To fully embrace this mindset, you must also kill the desires that have been inculcated in you since birth. Cut down on your consumer impressions by watching less TV and trying to rationally dissect the techniques used in the few advertisements you encounter. Find fulfillment in hobbies and work, rather than chasing the rush and eventual hedonic adaptation from consuming. Much like a drug, successive bouts of consumerism create a higher baseline where your overall happiness is no different, but you end up having a bunch of useless crap that ties you down. Girls can also be troublesome in this endeavor. Ever notice that when a girl spends extended time in your living space, she beings to tell you that you need a new this, or a replacement that A good friend once told me All human beings have an innate desire to create  most women cant, so they redecorate. Limit your exposure to women who attempt to thwart a separation from consumerism. Ironically, men likely to lead a minimalist/nomadic lifestyle are simply more attractive to primeSMV women. Think about whether the starving artist or the bottle service guy throwing money around ends up getting more ass. As always, watch how women behave rather than listening to what they say when they are protesting your lifestyle change. Ask yourself this If your house burned down and you had nothing but the clothes on your back, what would you be worth to society and to yourself How would you feel about losing all of the possessions you own Most people plugged into the matrix would rather die than think about replacing Aunt Gladyss vase or baby pictures they havent looked at in a decade. This is an illusion. Once you begin to divorce yourself from this emotional investment to stuff you will implicitly place more value on your skills and past experiences. Minimalism is not a synonym for frugality or cheapness. I dont wear a potato sack while pedaling a used tricycle to work every day  I simply choose to allocate my money to experiences and a few possessions that will fulfill me and advance my lifes purpose, rather than enslave myself into debt for trinkets that will collect dust somewhere. Taking the red pill is about learning to separate your priorities and desires from those that society forces upon you. I dont promise that adopting this mindset will make everybody happy, but it will certainly help to clarify what contributes to your individual sense of self, and will allow you to focus on the internal and external traits that exemplify a man of value.",hate
"By now everyone has been reminded that the media is not infallible. It is composed of very fallible human beings who make mistakes with the same regularity as all the rest of us. I was recently reading a bit about something in statistics called Galtons Problem, an observational dynamic named after its discoverer, Sir Francis Galton.To state it very crudely, Galtons Problem is a situation resulting when observers assume that certain things are separate and discrete, when in fact they are not. For example, those who failed to predict Donald Trumps electoral victory assumed that social conditions in the United States were isolated from those of the rest of the world. Such people failed to notice the evidence of widespread public anger in many other countries, most notably England, Italy, France, and Hungary.Sir Francis GaltonFailure to take into consideration the big picture is still forgivable, of course no one can be right all the time, or even most of the time. Systems in the modern world suffer from too much input and data, rather than too little. But deliberate lying is quite another matter. And it is undeniable that some mainstream media outlets have deliberately sought to conceal the truth on a variety of domestic and foreign issues. Rather than act as a check on governmental power, the media has actually become an arm of government power, enforcing doctrinal orthodoxy with a variety of carrots and sticks that have proven to be reasonably effective.Individual journalists can play significant roles in this process. Consider a favorite example of mine, the case of famed baseball player Ty Cobb. Ive been an admirer of Cobb for a very long time, ever since reading his autobiography as a boy. Something never quite felt true about all those stories that other biographers would tell about him. The worst of these was sports writer Al Stump, whose biography of Cobb has now been discredited as mostly fabrication.Stump was granted exclusive access to Ty Cobb in 1960 and 1961 for his biographical purposes. Cobb shared with him many intimate details of his life and career but instead of faithfully reproducing those recollections, Stump embellished, slanted, and outright fabricated numerous anecdotes designed to cast Cobb in the worst possible light. Stump portrayed Cobb as a southern racist Cobb was from Georgia, a misogynist, and even a murderer. Cobb was not alive at the time all these stories began to circulate and was unable to defend himself.To add insult to injury, Stumps writings were used as the basis for a terrible 1994 film called Cobb, which starred Tommy Lee Jones. The film is a tissue of lies and distortions that deserved toand didflop at the box office. The real Ty Cobb was a complex, driven, and highly intelligent figure, who knew how to court controversy when he had to, but was actually a gentleman by the standards of the era. Readers interested in further reading should consult the wonderful biography by Charles Leerhsen entitled Ty Cobb A Terrible Beauty .A famous photo of Cobb stealing third baseTo begin with, Cobb used brains rather than brawn to beat his opponents. He made careful studies of all the top players of his day and crafted strategies designed to exploit their weaknesses. For example, when he learned that pitcher Walter Johnson hated hitting batters with pitches, Cobb would crowd the plate to force Johnson to walk him. He learned how to get inside the heads of his adversaries, forcing them to lose their tempers when they did, Cobb would steal bases right under their noses. He remains one of the few players in history who knew how to steal home base.One legend about Cobb that has persisted is that he was a violent brawler. This is simply not true. It is true that men of his era got into fistfights oftenit was part of a healthy masculine culture back thenbut he never gratuitously assaulted or struck anyone. The few incidents that have been held out as examples of his misbehavior e.g., a fight with a black groundskeeper and assorted hotel brawls prove to be on closer inspection nothing more than the standard types of fights that physicallyminded men like him became entangled with. Nearly all ballplayers of his era engaged in them, including Babe Ruth.Al Stumps character assassination of Cobb went even further, painting him as an unreconstructed southern racist who had a grudge against blacks. This is completely false. Cobb was actually one of the few early supporters of integration in the big leagues. When asked his opinion about subject by the Sporting News in 1952, he said, The negro has the right to compete in sports, and who is to say he has notHe had nothing but compliments for black athletes like Willie Mays and Jackie Robinson, and players in the Negro League whom Cobb interacted with in the 1920s confirm that there was no trace of prejudice in Cobbs makeup. Cobb mentored younger players, corresponded with fans with personalized letters, and helped found a hospital and a college education fund.Cobb was certainly no angel, but in hindsight he was nothing more than an aggressive, daring man who played professional sports at a time when things were much less regulated than they are now. Cobb himself may even have allowed spurious tales about himself to circulate in order to court publicity. But he had a limit, and complete fairy tales he would not tolerate.Stumps lies have been so pervasive and persistent that the mythology surrounding Cobb will take decades to undo. If anything, Cobb was too trusting in letting a man like Stump into his confidence. Cobb was so angry with Stumps hatchet job that he was preparing to sue to prevent publication of Stumps writings in 1961, just before his death. The terrible 1994 film Cobb only added more oil to the fire.Malicious journalism can do serious damage. Sometimes the damage comes from ignorance, other times from deliberate peddling of falsehood. The motives for lyingwhether coming from money, fame, or the desire to virtue signalcan always be found if one digs below the surface. In the modern era, the default rule must be to seek independent confirmation of news stories, and to remember that journalists are subject to the same human emotions and weaknesses as all the rest of us.Read More  An Examination Of Cult Leader Game ",hate

George Soros Being Sued For 550 Million According to Breitbart , along with dozens of other alternative news sites, Dallas Police Department Sergeant Demetrick Pennie, President of the Dallas Fallen Officer Foundation, is suing a multitude of individuals for inciting a race warGeorge Soros Hillary Clinton Jesse Jackson Barrack Obama The New Black Panthers and more Some individuals might claim that theres no way someone can take on this collection of massively powerful and wealthy elites in a single lawsuit, and they may be right. However whether or not this lawsuit is successful, is completely irrelevant.What matters far more, is that the word is starting to get out there. The President of the Dallas Fallen Officer Foundation, an extremely reputable organization, is taking steps to file a massive lawsuit against these individuals. This will, at the very least, do several thingsPotentially serve a massive blow to the globalists Show the elites that we will not back down Generate huge amounts of public awareness Show the average gun rights promoting, masculine, traditional American that they have our support. And best of all The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, which means that the outcome will generally be good either way.First of all, theres a very high likelihood of them winning due to the case being handled in Texas, a highly conservative state. Second, in the event that the case doesnt win, it will likely be pursued all the way to the Supreme Court. If this occurs, expect truly amazing things to happen. The reason why The President of the United States is responsible for appointing Supreme Court judgesand guess whos going to be President in two months2. The GrubHub Crash After Matt Maloney, CEO of the online food delivery service GrubHub, proclaimed in an email that if you agree with Trumps politics you should resign, their stock dropped by nearly 10 in just a few days.Since this time, in addition to his companys stock tanking, he has received ample backlash on sites of all manner from Twitter to Facebook to Reddit to independent blogs to major altright news centers.This is what my fellow ROK contributors and manosphere bloggers were talking about when they mentioned the tangible impact of Trump voters. Hillarys supporters lack the characteristics necessary to make changeA burning passion and sense of purpose Moral fortitude and a sense of justice Selfconfidence, and the courage to stand up for your rights A fucking spine This is why we will win, period. The antiTrump crowd is based around having a massive entitlement complex, a victim complex, not thinking for yourself, and being a blind social sheep. Do people like this ever have ANY political or financial power in the worldOf course not Who do you think all of the hard working businessmen are All of the entrepreneurs All of the people investing in the stock market in order to take control of their financial future Hard working, intelligent men, who dont make excuses, obviously. And do you know what These are the types of men that voted for Donald Trump.Why do you think the Dow Jones Industrial Average is at an all time high Because Trumps win restored faith in America.3. Rise of the New Media The mainstream media has repeatedly shown to be completely incompetent in regards to actually reporting on the issues they are nothing more than a puppet show meant to distract, entertain, and brainwash the American public.They have consistently lied about candidates, manipulated the evidence, falsified facts, skewed statistics and polls, and defamed multiple individuals for a mere political opinion this will happen no longer.With the rise of the new media, more and more men have begun establishing outlets across all platforms Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Periscope, the list goes on and on.I firmly believe that the next eight years will be looked back on by historians as one of the most important times in all of humanitys time on this earth. America has brought the world stability we have stood as a symbol and an ideal for other countries to follow. We are a monolith of free speech, bravery, and economic prosperityand the elites have tried to destroy all of this to satisfy their greedy little egos.The men of America will not have this. Over the past 8 years Cough Obamas Presidency Cough we have seen an exponential increase in not only the quantity of alternative news outlets, but also the quality.Sites that were merely blogs a few years ago have evolved into fullblown news syndicates with live reporting, onsite video footage, and actual news anchors. This is literally the people fighting back we want freedom of speech, and we will have it.While the mainstream media draws its final breath, theyre proclaiming that theres this new, radical whitenationalist group called the altright, in an attempt to make us look like evil Fascists. In fact, I just had somebody threaten to kill me on Twitter , but was he banned Of course not.This repeated favoring of violent, mentally ill leftists makes it very clear what the MSMs agenda istotal control and a complete suppression of our freedoms of speech. Sorry, but the alternative media isnt going to let this happen.4. Massive Boycotts of AntiTrump Companies The lefts hypocrisy never ceases to amaze me. Somehow they can completely legally destroy an independent, family owned business for simply refusing to bake a gay couple a cake, but when Trump supporters simply boycott a multibillion dollar conglomerate, were the ones that are hatefulIn response to several CEOs statements regarding Trumps racism, and hate, the men and women who voted for Donald Trump decided to simply boycott them. Despite this completely legal and antiviolent response, the left is up in arms.Here is a list of companies whose CEOs have been caught attacking Donald Trump and his proAmerican policiesPepsiCo They own Pepsi, Lays, Mountain Dew, Starbucks, and More Nabisco Their brands include Oreo, Chips Ahoy, Ritz, and More Netflix Macys Ben  Jerrys Each and every single one of these companies has either spoken out against Trump directly, has refused to do business with Trump, or has moved factory production outside of the US such as Nabisco, which has started moving production to Mexico. Some companies, such as Ben  Jerrys, have even openly supported the terrorist movement Black Lives Matter .Again, what do these actions signify in Trump supporters Power. Assertiveness. Courage. A willingness to take action. This is why Donald Trump wonhis supporters are grown ups, not little babies who want more safe spaces and antifree speech zones.When Donald Trumps voters get oppressed by the biased, controlled media, or by elite globalists, they dont whine or cry about it, they just do something. They protest and stop supporting companies that are shipping our jobs away. They speak out in a logical, rational way against the anger and hatred that the left has towards white men.They take their lives into their own hands rather than relying on a stupid system that caters to cry babies and whiners. They take their health into their own hands, they take their finances into their own hands, and they take their relationships into their own hands.They dont wait around for someone else to do it for themthey get it done themselves. This is why Trump got into office, and this is why were going to make America great again.Read More 5 Ways To Start Fighting Back Against The Onslaught Of Liberalism ",hate
"Home This Month Popular The Path Men Took To Trump The Path Men Took To Trump Daryush Roosh Valizadeh created ROK in October 2012. You can visit his blog at RooshV.com or follow him on Twitter and Facebook RSS November 20, 2016 Politics Every man who supports Donald Trump came to it from a different path. Some of you support him because of economic impoverishment or because you have seen your neighborhoods degrade from illegal immigrants . Or maybe you support him because you were attacked for being politically incorrect. For me and many other men, we came to support Trump because we shared truths about sex and the true nature of women . The fight began in 2012 with the Southern Poverty Law Center In March 2012, after years of teaching men how to improve their sex lives through books and web sites , I was put on a list by the Jewishoperated Southern Poverty Law Center for being a misogynist . I was shaken up by this because I knew that my desire to enjoy sex with beautiful women and share the truths Ive learned from it put me on a path of no return. Either I close down shop immediately or accept that the mob would one day come pounding on my door. I decided to keep going. I responded to the SPLC designation with an article titled My Existence Is Becoming Illegal , where I described how heterosexual sex was now a defiant political act if the male received any benefit from it. It is clear that gender hate is now a oneway street. Men can hate women but not the other way around. Men can rape, women cant. Men can be abusive, both physically and emotionally, but women cant. Men can be misogynist, but women cant be misandrist, a word that is unknown to most of the American population. Men can be described as lazy slobs who play video games all day, but women are perfect asis in a country where there are organizations trying to convince you that being fat is both healthy and beautiful. Male teachers get sent to poundmeintheass prison if they have sex with a student, but female teachers only get a slap on the wrist. If youre a man, youre likely a perpetrator of hate, violence, and abuse to innocent American women, even if you dont yet realize your thought crime, but never the other way around. Fast forward two years to October 2014. Witch hunts by leftists were in force. Rage mobs were crawling through social networking looking for racists, homophobes, and sexists with the aim of getting them fired. I studied the people who were participating in these witch hunts and wrote one of the most important articles Ive ever published What Is A Social Justice Warrior SJW  The article was widely shared, influencing how people viewed the useful idiot layer of individuals who were guided and controlled by establishment forces consisting of academia, the corporate news media, Hollywood, Fortune 500 companies, Silicon Valley, and the billionaire owners of our politicians. Scratch a feminist SJW and youll find the reptilian skin of a billionaire who created the narrative she believes. I was pessimistic when I wrote the SJW article, thinking wed need a full generation 25 years to even begin defeating such a powerful antiAmerican entity . I focused on teaching men selfdefense and avoidance instead of ways to defeat them. Little did I know that I was defining them at their absolute peak, and barely two years later a candidate who stood for the diametric opposite of social justice would win the presidency. The social justice warriors havent gone away, and they are rushing to fulfill the will of George Soros by refusing to accept the results of a fair election, but the power they have to force people to bend to their demands has been reduced, along with the power of the institutions that support them. Though SJWism peaked in 2014, I had to face the full brunt of their attacks in the summer of 2015 during the Canadian stops of my lecture tour and again in February 2016 during the international meetups . I survived those attacks, and the fact that Im still here right now and able to exercise my free speech on all my platformswhile youre still here participatingshows clearly how little power they really had to stop us. They bruised me during the meetup outrage, but I healed quickly enough to weaponize my sites to spread my support of an even bigger enemy of theirs, Donald Trump. Donald Trump ground zero Im a pessimist by nature, so I didnt have much hope that the establishment would allow Trump to win in the primaries, even though I was confident his ideas resonated with most Americans. But then I noticed that he simply couldnt be knocked out, no matter what his enemies did. I saw him humiliate Jeb Bush , outcompete a resurgent Ted Cruz, and smack down any attempt by the media to force him to display weakness. By the time I attended the Republican National Convention in Cleveland , I started to believe. The ground zero for Donald Trump within the manosphere was The Donald Trump thread on the forum, created in June 2015 by veteran member and ROK contributor Samseau . This is where the battle unfolded for thosuands of men. Over 2,000 pages long, the thread has been viewed nearly 6 million times. Ideas within it have filtered out into mainstream discourse, as described here , to men with bullhorns larger than I have. After significant battles in a real war, medals are awarded but soldiers dont nitpick on who was the best soldier. They all worked as a team to ensure victory, from the General Donald Trump, the Colonels his advisers, the Captains major media influencers like Alex Jones, Matt Drudge, Paul Joseph Watson, and Mike Cernovich, the Sergeants men like myself, the Specialists men like Samseau, and on down to the Private, a regular commenter who contributes the occasional meme or argument in his spare time. The ego cares about how impactful one is, how influential its ideas are, but the team player only cares about victory for the whole. Whether I am a Private or a Sergeant, I fought side by side with men in that thread and on this web site to what amounts to a modern fourthgenerational informational war that will be studied by historians in the future. Who would have guessed that public internet sites operating on free opensource software would have such a positive effect on not just the result of the election, but on the lives of so many men who participated in it. Approaching the date of the election Two months before the election, I did a Youtube video urging men to vote for Trump , and it resulted in nearly 150 unsubscribes within a day, surprising even me since I thought my audience was mostly men who would automatically support a Trump presidency. The video echoed a lot of sentiments I shared in the article If Donald Trump Doesnt Win, Were Screwed , where I tried to convey the danger of a Hillary presidency. Obama was the race president, and look how badly he has damaged race relations in only eight years. Hillary will be the gender president. The future we have in store should be absolutely clear to you if she happens to defeat Trump. Not only will she move to establish a technomatriarchy where men are secondclass citizens to any female, but she will ensure that no movement or organization will be able to challenge her or her establishment cronies ever again. This isnt a trivial matter of getting banned from a web site like Twitter or Youtubemany of you will be forced to escape the country for no other reason than you happening to be a man who found himself on the wrong side of the establishment. For the next month, I stared at the calendar, waiting for the election to happen, doing what I could to push back against the narrative on Twitter . Then in early October, an old tape was released of Trump saying he grabs girls by the pussy because they let him. My sister called me, confused, and asked if he really was a bad man. I told her that the media is distorting his comments just like they distorted mine a few months earlier when their proclaimed me as a  prorape advocate . I told her not to believe the media and to judge Trump by his actions and his policies, not a gotcha moment that was being spun out of control to help Hillarys failing campaign. I spoke to her with confidence, but inside I was concerned in a politically correct world, would this be the blow to sink Trumps candidacy Is the majority of Americans actually ready to defeat political correctness Thankfully, Trump responded strongly, ignoring calls by the traitors in the Republican party to step down. The first poll to come in after pussygate suggested that Trumps support didnt decline. The fake controversy didnt work. I held my breath for the next few days to see if another tape would come out, maybe of him saying the nword, but none did, and I knew the establishment had no more bullets. This was the moment where I finally believed. I felt a rush of energy on that day as my subconscious accepted that Trump was going to win. I did a Periscope that night as if I was amped up on methamphetamine, but I took no drug. From that point on it was just a matter of hanging on, until finally on November 8 when he was elected President. I was in disbelief after he won because it was only four years prior when I was attacked by the same forces that were aligned against Trump. I didnt have to wait long until my personal enemies were dealt a monstrous defeat by another man whom I consider on the same team as us. If I made any miscalculation, it was that it would take a generation or longer for us to begin pushing back against establishment forces. I underestimated our own power, and those of our allies in the alternative internet space. Human control is a foolhardy endeavor The most important lesson I learned from Trumps victory is how pointless it is to control human beings, both their behaviors and their minds. Every single major institution in the United States, represented by billions of dollars of economic activity and influence, could not stop a populist candidate, in spite of trying everything short of assassination. George Soros and his billions werent effective. Obama and his allies werent effective. The mainstream media and their dozens of outlets werent effective. CEOs of the biggest companies in the United States werent effective. Hollywood and its superstars werent effective. Academia and its thousands of professors werent effective. Social media and its censorship efforts werent effective. The FBI allowing Hillary to skate from real crimes wasnt effective. Even Donald Trumps own party wasnt effective in stopping him. Its absolutely incredible that all these forces couldnt stop one man and his believers. What a disgrace to the fields of scientific management and modern propaganda for them all to fail so miserably Think right now of how much effort the antiTrump forces put into stopping him from winning. Think of how much money they spent to guarantee their desired outcome. And now think how it was all for nothing . They accomplished the very opposite of what they moved mountains to accomplish, after decades of cementing their control within the country by sucking the truth and life blood from the American public. Whatever term you use to describe the force that governs our existencenature, God, Tao, or so onit is clear that humans cannot control it all, and that the pendulum will swing when it wants to swing, that the wheel of history will turn when it wants to turn, and your billions of dollars and your propaganda and your institutions can do nothing to stop it. Imagine how impotent George Soros and his friends must feel after their limitless money and influence was all for nothing. Now they have to perfect their control methods even more, open their pocket books further, and try to force their will upon a population as if pushing food into the mouth of someone who is already full. Their desire to control you is nothing but their own psychological failings of trying to alleviate their crippling fears, of trying to prove to themselves and to the world that they are a somebody, that they are powerful, that the world must be shaped into their image, that they are gods among men, but it should be clear to you by now that they are not gods but sociopaths who gamed an economic system to amass huge amounts of capital and money. Much of that will be flushed down the drain as they continue to fight and grasp their way to unequivocal defeat, or attempting to control those who do not want to be controlled. You can control human beings, but only temporarily and only some of them. At the end of the day, humans want to do what they want to do, and if you dont possess what they wish to buy, they will go to someone who does, no matter how much money you spend on your mechanisms of control. The more you control what does not want to be controlled, the more tension is created and then released in the great unraveling, of which we are currently living through. In previous eras, that tension resulted in victorious parades on the streets, but in our modern era, it is in the form of online celebrations with the use of tweets and memes. If you want to be a true leader of society, create an environment where humans can associate with whom they want, can freely engage in commerce, can create families, can live in safety, can search for the truth without interference, and can work and play and live according to their nature. Put stone walls blocking their righteous will and watch them be torn down. It may take a decade, it may take 100 years, but it will happen, and the contraptions you used to control them will reveal not your strength but your own pathetic weakness. Conclusion We are tired of being controlled. Leave us alone. We are tired of institutions that are obsessed with controlling us, of forcing us to believe in falsehoods, of programming us to hate our country, of pitting woman against man and black against white. Leave us alone Let men be men, and from that a new American renaissance will come forth. Men who are strong and good must be allowed to live their lives, and if you prevent us from doing so, we wont allow you to live yours. We will humiliate your useful idiots, we will destroy your institutions, we will lash out with more than just memes. Im afraid that those who stand against us are gearing up for even greater authoritarian control over us, but at least now we have our man in the White House who can join us in a fight that we have already been battling for many years. I cant wait to see where this fight takes us next. Nov 20, 2016 Roosh Valizadeh ",hate
"Submit Home This Month Popular 8 Reasons Why You Should Try Photography As A Hobby 8 Reasons Why You Should Try Photography As A Hobby Photography really is one of the most rewarding hobbies a man could pursue Ness Nomadison Ness is a thirtysomething American with almost a decade of experience living and traveling across Asia. Hes a strong believer in pursuing ones passions, continual selfimprovement, and just being the best man he can be. He runs his own website, NessTheNomad.com . November 21, 2016 Lifestyle Have you ever had a curiosity in photography, yet you werent sure if its a hobby really worthy of your limited time Then this article was written for you, as I was also once in your shoes. I picked up a DSLR camera for the first time back in 2013, which awoke a passion inside me that I never even knew was there. Three and half years later, Im here to tell you just a few of the many benefits and realizations Ive experienced by taking on this timeless hobby. Here are eight reasons photography might just be the most meaningful hobby youve overlooked your entire life. 1. An Opportunity to Flex Your Creative Muscle In order to be balanced human beings, I believe people need to be physically healthy, spiritually awake, and creatively expressive. Photography, just like writing and film, is a selfless way to be creative while also giving something back to the world. The way we interpret our world changes from individual to individual, and photography provides a medium for people to express themselves. Ask ten different photographers to photograph the same thing  a city for example  and be prepared to see ten wildly different visions of the same subject. In our sensoryoverload world, it feels good to create something thats uniquely you. 2. Appreciate and Understand Your Surroundings More I now find myself seeing everything around me in rectangular framesa takeaway from having to frame so many pictures over the years. Oh, those people over there would fit perfectly into a 32 box, or that building over there would look perfect boxed in from this angle. My eyes are now sharper than ever. But I also find myself observing and appreciating all the little things around me. I always have to keep my camera nearby, because I often want to photograph something Ive noticed in my daily routine. The pattern on a sewer lid, a reflection in a puddle, birds perched in a tree, and so forth. My prephotographer self, just like most of the rest of the world, would have walked right past these things without a care in the world. Yet now I can be entertained from the most minuscule and simple things, especially if my camera is handy. The world is full of photogenic things, if can just teach yourself to notice them. 3. Help Preserve History Since its inception, photography has always been one of the most moving ways to preserve history in our rapidly changing modern times. Photos touch people in a way other media cant. Both photography and video are both visual arts, but photographs differ in that they capture merely one frame of what is going on. Yet one frame is all one needs to feel taken back to another time. With the advent of the smartphone, photography is as accessible as ever. While this sounds good on paper, the truth is our worlds becoming more and more flooded with garbage and narcissistic photographs. Our world needs more adventurous and welltrained photographers out there taking photos of the modern world we live in and the rapid changes its undergoing. These are the photos that will be cherished decades down the road, not all the shitty selfies that bog down social media. 4. Travel Experiences Will Be More Meaningful Photography goes with traveling like bread goes with butter. It took me nearly five years of traveling internationally to finally get serious about doing photography on my trips, and after I got started, I never looked back. Rather than traveling for escapism and hedonism, Im traveling to learn about and document our world. As a result, my trips feel much more meaningful and fulfilling than they ever did before. The way you see and come to understand a country as a photographer is quite different than if you werent one. I now divide my history of travel experiences into two separate groupsthe trips I had before I owned a DSLR camera, and the trips I had after buying one. Photography is so fun and addicting, that I find myself wanting to go back to all those preDSLR camera destinations, even the ones I didnt enjoy all that much, just so I can reexperience them with a camera in hand. 5. An Opportunity to Meet New People One thing I always try to do when I travel is meet fellow photographers. Whether they be foreign or local, I appreciate talking to people with an observational eye, as they can provide me with unique insight that nonphotographers rarely can. But photography doesnt just help you meet other photographers, it helps you meet other people from all walks of life. Ive had regular people on the street come up and talk to me once they saw I was taking photos. Ive also met people from online for no other reason than they liked my work. Being a good photographer can also be a great way to meet women. Theyre not gonna start blowing you as soon as they see your awesome pictures, but dont be surprised if you discover some newfound female admiration once your excellent photography skills are out in the open. And if you can make a woman look beautiful in a photo, shell admire you in a way you never imagined. 6. A Blog with an Edge In the diverse world of independently run blogs, how many bloggers do you know who can both write well and photograph well I can literally only think of one , and the fact that this blogger is just as good at utilizing a camera as he is at wielding a pen or rather a keyboard, puts his website in a league of its own in terms of quality content. Though I still highly respect the good bloggers out there for their amazing writing skills and insights, I think theyre doing both their readers and websites a great disservice by merely using stock photos or shitty shotwithacellphone photos in their articles. Readers can definitely tell the difference when a blogger takes all of their own photos with a nice DSLR camera. Start taking nice, DSLRshot photos and see for yourself how they can enhance your articles. Theyll give you just that much more of an edge over all the other bloggers who dont. 7. Youll Also Have an Edge over 98 of Others on Social Media and Dating Sites Since everyone else is posting lame, smartphonetaken shots all over their social media accounts, your DSLRshot photos could shine like diamonds in the rough. The same way you stand above 98 of other men by lifting weights regularly, the same advantage can be expected by not taking cheap shortcuts with your social mediabound photography. Your Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter accounts will all look better than ever before. This is also true for dating websites and apps, where most chumps just take some lame mirror selfies with their smartphone and then upload them to their accounts. Dudes with welltaken, nontraditional photos stand out big time. Dont just take my word for it, as there has actually been plenty of discussion about these benefits over at the Roosh V Forum . And although they can be very helpful, you dont actually need another photographer with you to get some good shots of yourself. Rather all you need is your camera, an autofocus lens, a tripod, a remote shutter, and a creative eye. 8. A Resumeenhancing, Marketable Skill Photography isnt just mentally rewarding, it can also be financially rewarding if you play your cards right. The field of profitable photography may be vast and highly competitive, but one things for sure  the demand for new photographs is infinite. The world never stops turning after all. Stock, portrait, wedding, wildlife, travel, sports, and news photography are just a few of the most in demand and profitable niches. But if you really wanna make money selling your photographs, you gotta make a name for yourself by sharpening your skills and networking with the right people. A great photographer who no one knows exists wont make any money. My father is an outdoorsman slash wildlife photographer with decades of experience, tens of thousands of photos, and a giant network of contacts from his industry. It seems like magazine and website editors are always knocking on his door, because they know he probably has a nice shot of exactly what theyre looking for. Often all he has to do is dig through his archives, and boomhes made 500 bucks. Conclusion Stop dreaming about it, and just give photography a shot already. Borrow your friend or a family members DSLR camera for the weekend, and just get out there and take pictures of anything that strikes your fancy. Photography takes decades to master, but it all begins with a single click of the shutter button. Yet sometimes all it takes is one little click to realize youve been missing out on something very big and meaningful your entire life. Youll never know until you try.",hate
"More people are coming to the truthful conclusion that globalism is a failure and nationalism, where a countrys people and interests are valued above that of noncitizens, is the way forward. A problem is that the globalismnationalism framework is exactly the type of dialectic elites can use to usher in a global war or crackdown to further increase their power.Imagine there is a wife who is tired of her husband going out every night with his friends to drink. Instead of nagging at him every evening, which would have the effect of motivating him to leave the house even sooner, she will wait until he gets into a drunk driving accident or serious bar fight so she could draw the line and make the reasonable ultimatum for him to never drink again. The husband is more likely to listen to her after something wrong takes place than after he had a safe night out.Right now the nationalist movement is being allowed to gain strength so that a future event can act as a trigger for globalists to draw the line on the movement by imprisoning or killing its strongest members. In other words, globalists plan to use nationalism as a trap, a device they transform into to their advantage. As of right now, the budding nationalist movement is extremely useful in allowing them to identify all resisters before easily crushing them when the time is right.Elites cannot advance their plans without a dialectic The way the elites move an agenda forward is through a dialectic , meaning that two opposing ideologies rub against each other, create friction, and from that comes a desired result i.e. order from chaos. Those in power either control or monitor the existence of both sides to guide and bend the dialectic to serve their ends.The recent rise in nationalism, I speculate, has been allowed because previous dialectics such as capitalism vs communism and democracy vs terrorism are no longer useful in advancing the desired agenda. Soviet Communism is dead and increased terrorism did not allow planned wars in Syria and Iran to proceed like 9/11 did with Iraq and Afghanistan. In addition, the white vs black race war is years late, stubbornly resistant to the gasoline that Obama pours onto the fire. A new dialectic must be nurtured, and so nationalism may just do the trick. Hillarys recent alt right speech officially debuted American nationalism as the new enemy.While your conclusion that nationalism is logical and beneficial to a nation is true, and Im sure to agree with it, you were guided onto those beliefs. How did you arrive at nationalist thought Through decades of free trade, feminism, and opendoor immigration that have worn you and your country down. Your arrival at nationalist conclusions is the direct result of globalism, which means that nationalist thoughts exist in your mind only because of the likes of George Soros, who pulled out a million Muslims from his hat and placed them in Europe while sponsoring a multitude of social justice organizations in the United States. His actions and behavior, along with other powerful globalists like him, have essentially created your very ideology, because you are entrenched in a dialectic where opposing forces must exist and be in combat with each other.The growth of nationalism is useful Nationalism must continue to grow in power right before the moment it can threaten globalist banking and geopolitical interests, and when it does, the globalists will clamp down severely on it. As if replaying World War 2, they will identify a nationalist country as the big bad bully, and then use that country as an excuse to start a war that will simultaneously weed out nationalists throughout the world by sending them to die or having them arrested at home for subversion or treason. Russia is the evil nationalist country that neocons and others have been poking, and even Poland is being puffed up into an undemocratic country in order to hedge their bets.A hint that this may already be taking place is that France recently called upon patriots to serve in their National Guard to protect citizens. Since when does France care about patriots They have committed no consistent actions in the past decade that suggest they do care, so we must reasonably conclude that this new army is a trap to attract nationalists into a game where the end result is their death. I wouldnt be surprised if Frances beefedup army is used to start a war in a place like Poland, which will be painted as an aggressor that caused economic attacks upon the saintly Western Europeans.As long as youre in the dialectic, which I see as a sort of Twilight Zone creation of the mega rich, youre fighting on their terms. They need the nationalist grassroots uprising to create violent events that allow them to reassert control and power. Even though nationalism may be the most sane movement of the day, it still plays into their hands as long as we insist on having only two sides of the debate, good and evil, as if we were living in a Hollywoodstyle storyline. Instead of this twodimensional arrangement, the solution may be to go 3D, where you can move front and back and around in a spectrum of ideas, instead of just left and right where youre a pawn of the game no matter what side you pick.Just because a nationalist resistance is growing, doesnt mean that that the globalists in power are being hurt. Without being able to effectively control the Western population through the Cold War, terrorism, racial divideandconquer, or modern Russian aggression, they are hoping that the nationalist movement grows enough to create the conflict that moves their chess pieces forward. While Im not urging you to throw away your nationalist beliefs, as I surely wont throw away mine, it is clear to me that a trap is waiting to be sprung, and we will all suffer when its finally launched.This article was originally published on Roosh V .

"Its now been over a week since the most glorious victory ever recorded in the war against rapacious globalism and lunatic Cultural Marxismthe election of Donald Trump to the Presidency of the United States. Like many of you, I was outside with my fellow tribesmen  the same tribe our opponents tried to shut down in February  until about 4 A.M. on Election Day. As you may expect, it was a joyous occasion that Ill never forget.Yet, as I remarked at the time, while this was a glorious victory, a decisive one that ended the campaign, the war would continue. I had hoped to be as magnanimous as possible in victory, to finally bridge some divides and begin to move past the insanity weve been dealing with thats accelerated in the past few years. However, as has quickly become apparent, the Cultural Marxists, SJWs, and their globalist overlords have no intention of coming to terms or engaging in meaningful selfreflection anytime soon. Instead, theyre doubling down on everything that voters resoundingly rejected on November 8th.Predictably, there have been protests and some riots. Incidents of violence on the left have taken place and gone underreported. Just as predictably, most of these protests are professionally organized , with George Soros likely pulling at least a few of the strings. Learning nothing, the regressive leftists taking to the streets, complete with their Year Zero pathology, think themselves morally justified in blocking streets and attacking people, because theyre on a mission to purify society. Anything that stands in the way of that mission can be justly eliminated. I came across one of these protests a few days ago. It was generic and small, basic bitch shit, really. But recall that these are merely the peons in the army of their overlords. Their intensity will dissipate with time. The safetypin wearing, safespace occupying, neonhaired freaks arent the ones to take note of on the grand strategic map. The bigger picture to focus on is the drive toward increased censorship in the past few days.The recent counteroffensive began with the uproar over Donald Trumps selection of Steve Bannon to be his chief White House strategist. The media and its acolytes on social media went into another coordinated attack, lambasting Bannon and Breitbart , which he ran, as having connections to the altright, which in turn, they say, is associated with white nationalism. To reinforce this pairing, the media ran with a couple of the most controversial Breitbart headlines.If you recognize this tactic, its because the media A/B tested this against Roosh in February. They took the  How to Stop Rape  headline, said that it proved that Roosh was prorape, and then repeated endlessly.This is actually a sort of hypnosis trick and was certainly done deliberately. Scott Adams calls this wordthinking Rational People Use data and reason to arrive at truth. This group is mostly imaginary.WordThinkers Use labels, word definitions, and analogies to create the illusion of rational thinking. This group is 99 of the world.Persuaders Use simplicity, repetition, emotion, habit, aspirations, visual communication, and other tools of persuasion to program other people and themselves. This group is about 1 of the population and effectively control the wordthinkers of the world.He further describes the phenomenon of wordthinking Wordthinking is important to persuasion because if you can convince someone to accept a label on an opponent, it turns off their critical thought and turns on their confirmation bias. Nuance is lost. Context is lost. All that matters once the label is accepted is whatever qualities the label already contained.And this is what the media is doing. They did it with Roosh and are now doing their damndest to do it to Bannon, no doubt as one of the thousand paper cuts they hope to use to take President Trump down.Because the term altright is relatively fresh, its vulnerable to being defined with the most ominous, dark terms possible, which is why the media is trying furiously to create as much connective tissue between it and white nationalism as possible. Remember, with wordthinking, nuance and context are lost.And now that this first step has been achieved where it was meant to, the selfanointed moral cover for the more alarming stage of the counteroffensive is underway. Now that the ambiguous and ominoussounding altright has been attempted to be extensively defined, the solution is obviously to crack down on it and anyone having to do with it even if they really dont. Given this pretext, the purges and censorship have begun, with numerous prominent Twitter accounts being suspended. Agree with these accounts or not I often dont, it should give you pause that this kind of blanket censorship is being implemented. If youre just a little bit politically unorthodox, youre now at heightened risk of being slapped with the altright label even if youre on record as not identifying with it and banned from outlets of communication that are both vital for pushing your ideas forward and for promoting any business you have.But banning individuals is only stage one. Stage two is the recent drive by Google, Facebook, Twitter, and others to censor what they call fake news. The media has been on a blitz against these fake news articles, completely unironically given that this is the same crowd that uncritically signal boosted the Rolling Stone rape hoax to the ends of the world, fact checks Donald Trumps comment that Hillary Clinton acid washed her private email server, selectively edits clips to promote the narrative that their pets in Black Lives Matter are entirely peaceful when they arent , and fails to disclose contacts and relationships with officials of the Democratic National Committee while writing about the campaign.No, this is not the Onion.While this drive deserves to be a subject of laughter, we must nevertheless still take it seriously. There have already been reports of shadow bans on Twitter with prominent figures such as Mike Cernovich and Scott Adams, and its far from out of the question that a blacklist of sorts gets put up for outlets such as Return Of Kings , which were crucial in taking control of the narrative during the campaign. All the while, the media continues to nitpick, inflate, and manufacture anything they can turn into a controversy about the incoming Trump administration. Narrative warfare is far from over.What Can We Do Fortunately, we have a master persuader in Donald Trump to lead the way, but we at the grassroots, the grunts in the trenches, if you will, must continue our efforts.First, we need to begin to dehypnotize those that can be. Scott Adams had some thoughts on that , but here are the crucial points1. The basis of the hypnosis in recent days has been around pairing the terms altright and fake news with all sorts of bad things.2. Take away that pairing and youve made significant inroads.Ive A/B tested this sort of thing numerous times. Remember Mike Cernovichs maxim that conflict is attention and attention is influence. Here are a few pointers.1. Just like with women, frame control is paramount. The inevitable tactic that theyll try to use is to associate anyone opposed to them with the worst elements of their side. Fortunately, our opponents have arguably worse elements given their blanket of moral superiority and cultural influence. Refocus the frame on those. Make them own their own worst elements.2. Appeal to vanity. Most people like to think of themselves as rational. Tell them that their wordthinking is literally shutting down their critical thinking skills. I did this with a girl after the first debate, explaining to her that because the movie in her head pictured a Mexican in a certain way, her critical thinking skills turned off, and that what Trump said about the Mexican judge would be equally applicable to someone of another heritage like German. Its a long story, but her face was a picture. Tell them that theyre seeing things not based on reality, but on the movies playing in their heads, triggered by a certain word. Then watch the cognitive dissonance come.On the broader level, heres what we can do1. Continue on as usual. Continue to make a cultural impact. Get those websites, books, movies, and so on out there. Echoing what one member of the forum said politics is air cover, culture is the ground war. They can try to censor fake news all they want, but we are too numerous to control if we dont cooperate. Its now time to redouble our efforts.2. Dont talk to any aggrieved victimhood class on social media if theyre acting hostile to you. Theyll use any excuse to ban you. Law 36 Disdain Things You Cannot Have, Ignoring them is the Best Revenge.3. Begin to build new networks. Gab is up and coming and is far more free speech friendly.4. I will echo what many others have said on the forum. MAKE FUN OF THEM. Theyre a prime target for humor. Believe me when I say most people are sick of the special snowflakes on the street as well as the media.This is a time of great opportunity, but we need to readjust for the new moves our opponents are making. Theyre doing everything they can to censor us and delegitimize Trump. Thats the next focus of the campaign. We must delegitimize them in turn.But take heart that were now in the ascendant. Otherwise they wouldnt be making these moves. I recall when I first visited Return Of Kings and the forum nearly four years ago, there was a general malaise in the atmosphere. Day after day, it seemed, we were suffering another defeat. No longer.What a ride its been.Read Next 3 Reasons Why You Should Apply For A Job In The Trump Administration ",hate
"Convinced that previous snow plowing policies were sexist, the city government of the Swedish capital of Stockholm recently implemented a feminist system for clearing it. It ended in disaster and the city came to an absolute standstill. For a start, four times as many people than usual were hospitalized for snowrelated injuries. Nearly as importantly, countless workers, most of them men, were prevented from getting to work. It would appear that the patriarchybacked snow won, as local politicians ended up apologizing for the havoccausing changes.Havoc like thisForgetting that motor vehicles are often more impeded by snow than pedestrians and create a greater safety risk, municipal resources, which had already been increased, were diverted to clearing bicycle paths and sidewalks and away from main roads. Areas like schools were also prioritized, which again ignores the frequently greater ease of walking in snow than driving in it, plus the longer distances car commuters face compared to children, mothers and other women walking to places. The situation is quite plainly moronic for a further reason nonmain roads and other parts of a city take up much more space, meaning that the Swedish capitals snow removal teams were targeting a far larger, less densely used zone. To boot, this was all during a November already breaking records for snowfall .The saga in Stockholm reads like an microcosm of feminism itself an overeducated meaning undereducated group of leftists come together, create data based on feelings, and produce a plan of action that screws up an entire community. Feminists in Stockholm had previously complained that the thoroughfares cleaned up first and most extensively by snowplows were the ones heavily used by men. How they came to this conclusion is unclear but, given the shutdown of the city that resulted from the feminist changes, it wasnt based on any solid reasoning. With private cars and public transport vehicles alike unable to move in many cases, the femalefriendly snowclearing ended up adversely impacting far more people, including women, than the old one.Well done, feminists and white knights.What this says about Sweden Is it really surprising that one of the people responsible for Stockholms femalefriendly snow plowing scandal, Mayor Karin Wanngrd, is a feminist and career politician who first joined the council in her teensBecause Sweden is perhaps the most concentrated welfare state in the world, not having people at their jobs and instead stuck in snow is a very bad thing. How can a country continue to pay such a large bill for handouts with elected representatives of the caliber of Stockholms trying to ruin things Sweden is also home to a growing class of lowskilled migrant communities, including many tens of thousands from the most recent Mediterranean waves last year. Its recent migrant population is now essentially the same proportionallyspeaking as states more typically associated with multiculturalism, such as Canada and Australia. And nonethnic Swedes in Sweden tend to come from more troublesome cultures, compared to the more assimilationfriendly East Asians and Indians emigrating to Canada and Australia.How Sweden intends to deal with issues like this while balancing urgent economic needs remains to be seen, especially with braindead initiatives like the snow plow fiasco taking precedence. Add to the mix the recent creation of a mansplaining hotline by a Swedish labor union and you start to see the real problems Scandinavias most basketcase society is trying to solve.So who was organizing the snow plowingand actually doing it Yup, you guessed it, its a man driving.Theres no doubt that the feminist snow plowing scheme was an unmitigated disaster. And its also extremely likely that the vast majority of people tasked with clearing Stockholms streets are men. Oh, the irony. Not only do feminist politicians try to preference women in the removal of snow, they expect men to do the work in achieving it. Just as sanitation workers and garbage collectors are invariably male, dont expect to catch too many female snowplow operators and other snowclearing employees in Stockholm.Wake up, Sweden Swedish multiculturalism in action.Stockholms snow removal catastrophe is emblematic of a country refusing to deal with its real malaise. While the men who built Sweden are categorized as wouldbe oppressors, Swedish society itself is close to breaking point. Even Stockholms central train station is now terribly unsafe and various city police forces have long made it known that they do not have control of many suburbs. In particular, Malm, Swedens third city, and certain districts of Stockholm are notorious for ethnic ghettos, gang violence, rape, and other crime.But no, mansplaining hotlines and not removing snow in a new, feminist way are the clear and present dangers most Swedes should fear at night.Read More Australian Male Senator Shuts Down Female Colleague For Accusing Him Of Mansplaining ",hate
"As feminism erodes down to its tattooed, lesbian core, we should stop and take a moment to wonder what the point of the third wave part of feminism was. Although it ultimately proves destructive to western societies to give women equality, at least the first and second wave had something legitimate to bitch about. Third wave feminism not so much, and today well talk about the underlying motives and the end game of it all.When one looks at modern feminism, you see women who have flipped the script, to use their term, and rewired life so that men are not necessary for them. A modern feminist has her own job that can meet her needs, but maybe not all her wants, and has her own small place with her cats and Netflix. When she wants the company of men, she goes out and sluts it up and is always successful due to the biological imperative of men.On the surface, a feminist woman may appear to be the analog of a Red Pill Man, yet, upon closer examination, she is actually an imperfect copy. A man works harder, more dangerous jobs, and makes more money because of it, thus he has money for anything he wants and more. A proper man has interesting hobbies and a healthy, fit lifestyle, and he must do this to fulfill his potential and inner drive, but also because he realizes that normal men do not get laid due to hypergamy and he must be the best he can be if he wants to be successful with women.However, the most crucial difference lies in the outcome. Women, who outlast their shelf lives while still being single are miserable, and I fully expect the suicide rate of women of my generation to skyrocket in about 5 years from now. Men, whose value is based on their production and can enjoy a later in life peak than women, also can live for other things than companionship and family, and can be quite happy on their own, even if they did want a family at one time, or still do.So, the question is, if women, despite their feminist pandering to the contrary, actually DO want a man to live with and grow old with, why is third wave feminism devoted to stopping that in every which way The answer, like most things, lies in the red pill philosophy. Women, including feminists, only want the best men modern feminism is nothing more than a nuclearlevel shit test.A woman needs an alpha man like a fish needs water SJW society today tells us that men are not supposed to hit on women in the grocery store, in the bookstore, or at the coffee shop because thats a precursor to stalking or some shit. At night, youre not supposed to hit on girls at the bar or club, because they are there with the friends and not looking for that. At work, youre not even supposed to talk to women about anything other than workrelated topics because thats harassment.If you are wondering where is a guy supposed to meet girls, then you get the point and the answer is that youre not. Feminists, and women in general, know that any man who actually allows them to regulate his behavior is not a man worth having in the first place, so they are only interested in men that see that the answer to feminisms constraints is to ignore them in the first place.Combining the above shit test with hypergamy will result in a winning combo. If a man is successful, good looking, and alpha enough, he has a good chance of pulling another mans wife directly out of their marriage and family and taking her away. Women are ultimately interested only in their own self interest and that means, when confronted with the best man she has ever beheld, she will go against feminism because it is not in her own best self interest at the time, and instead, be receptive to the man in hopes of snaring him.Ultimately, women DO still need and want men, they just dont want to be bothered by inferior men, and third wave feminism does a good job of convincing the betas to stay away until they are wanted for their paychecks by postWall NASCARstyle wrecks of women.When is enough enough When you look at feminism logically which is hard, you can come up with the premise that women have been disadvantaged over history, and feminism is an effort to balance the scales. They will disguise it in selfdepreciating irony feminism is the radical notion that men and women are equal, but what they really men is that men and women should be equal over the balance of history, and, since women have been so disadvantaged, men had better get ready for some suck to square the accounts.I bet shes been in 100 ROK articles by nowThe question then follows, if men owe women, how much are we talking Can it ever be paid off, or have women been so heinously treated over the entirety of our existence that there will never be enough atonement to make up for it I have three theories.It could be that men have apparently treated women so badly for all time that it can never be paid off because its an absolute. The problem with absolutes is they lack scope. The worst atrocities in history have been borne by both men and women alike, and it could be said that men have borne the heavier half, as they are usually expected to die before defeat in war, whereas women, although they get raped by the conquerors, at least get to live. I doubt most women have been treated that badly, though, on the balance, so there is probably some finite amount of penance men would do to restore equality.The other two theories center on the idea that, eventually, men will atone for all faults perceived by feminism, and the only difference lies in what happens then. My second idea is not a noble one, but it is probably the most accurate. Feminists, you see, are not for equality, they are for female supremacy, and, once equality is reached, women will get to be on top for millennia. Some would say we are already at that point, and this is why anyone who is not a feminist can see why the movement has faltered and lost whatever relevance it ever had. When you already have it all, shouldnt you stop and try to actually make things equal, that is, if you actually have moral integrityThats the third idea, the concept of, once all debts are paid, true equality would rule. I doubt this one would ever happen, as our victimhoodempowerment culture makes it advantageous to be a victim, and you cant be a victim if your demographic is on top. Plus, being feelers, not thinkers, the average woman lacks the intellectual capacity to be honest with themselves.Conclusion Combining the idea of feminism being a massive shit test to guys and a scam to win money and prizes from society just because you have a vagina, one can see that the only solution is to treat it like the cult bullshit it is. While that is nothing new for those of us here at Return of Kings , and nothing new for those our message reaches, the reason we must treat it like that has hopefully been a little more exposed to the light here.The reason that feminism makes no sense, and makes it seem like all men have no way to succeed and must lose everything is because that is precisely the point. There is no way to win, there is no equality, there is only female superiority, males that go along with it, and men that do not.Read More Feminism Has Lost The Minds Of Young Women ",hate

Facebook  Twitter November 23, 2016 Manosphere There are those who think we should only get our news from official sources. You know, like the blonde telling you what to believe in between hocking a hockey game. If theres anything the 2016 election showed us, its that the American people are increasingly distrustful of and not listening to the commands laid out by the once mainstream media. Theyre increasingly reticent to commit national and demographic suicide under the guise of diversity and other nebulous ideals. Theyre desperate not only to drain the swamp but to restore some sense of national pride and stability to the declining USA. In response, the controllers of the presstitutes the people who really run the world are already hard at work trying to find some way to create a false narrative about fake news sites in order to lay the ground work for censorship and control. The Internet has all but destroyed the corporategovernment narrative, and there is a shit fit happening at the highest levels of the propaganda ministry i.e. CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, et. al. because they have learned the American people know how full of shit they really are. Sites like Return Of Kings are on the front lines of this war in support of free speech and it is vitally important we stay on top of our game to avoid a reversion to the managed propaganda the centralized control of mass media gave us over the last 50 years. Hackers and leakers play right into the hands of the censorship narrative Make no mistake, one of the reasons leakers of misdeeds done by politicians and the elite they work for have been allowed to continue leaking dirty laundry is because it plays into the hands of those with designs on censorship and regaining control of the information the sheeple get to listen to. Having Julian Assange and Edward Snowden doing leaks of information and giving them extensive press coverage plays right into the hands of the censorship brigade because they can also play the protecting national security game when the time to silence dissent comes . Fake news is only the first assault in what is sure to become a full scale war on free speech on the Internet. We can be thankful Trump won the election rather than The Bitch since his election will slow the process of censorship, but the aggressiveness of the fake news narrative shows us how determined some people are to shut us up and shut us down. The New York Times is already on the front lines of this assault on free speech on the Internet. Only days after The Bitch lost the election, publisher Arthur Sulzberger published a Mea Culpa and promised to rededicate the newspaper to honest reporting. We cannot deliver the independent, original journalism for which we are known without the loyalty of our subscribers The New York Times promises to give the news impartially, without fear or favor We also approach the incoming Trump administration without bias. Dont buy into it. This is whats known in Public Relations as a diversion tactic. While we focus on our seeming victory, theyre already moving on to their next false narrative  socalled fake news. No sooner than the ink dried on the promise to give Trump a chance, The New York Times was moving to shut up the very people who made possible his rise to power  the altright and alternative news web sites. While some fake news is produced purposefully by teenagers in the Balkans or entrepreneurs in the United States seeking to make money from advertising, false information can also arise from misinformed social media posts by regular people that are seized on and spread through a hyperpartisan blogosphere. They did a spurious case study on how a rumor got started about protesters being bussed in to protest at Trump rallies. Never mind the mainstream media is a business that runs lock, stock and barrel on fake news. Almost every narrative they create is a false one. One need do no more than a Google search to discredit many, if not most of the mainstream medias stories. The hypocrisy is astounding. Pulling The Plug Facebook censorship algorithms are nothing compared to the elites agenda of eliminating free speech online Whether or not the fake news narrative gains traction, the next step will be for the elite to create a problem that affects millions of people online, then follow through with the Hegelian Dialectic with a preordained solution to make everyone safer online and to stop the spread of false information while protecting free speech online by destroying it. Look for no less than a figurative Internet 9/11 if the elite become desperate enough. Theyll pull the plug on the backbone of the Internet, shutting down ecommerce and communication online for a few days, blame it on a fake news story just like Benghazi was blamed on a YouTube video then spring in to save us from ourselves by passing all sorts of creative laws and restrictions aimed at nothing more than eliminating competition to the corporategovernment narrative and gutting yet another of our Bill of Rights protections. Make no mistake, Freedom of Speech is the most important of Amendments to the Constitution. Once that is taken away, its Game Over. Obama has already floated the idea of silencing those of us who cling to our guns and religion and continues this narrative even after the election of Trump Obama has already been floating the idea of official news web sites. This is nothing more than proposing the creation of the American equivalent of Pravda in the Soviet Union, in which only the stateapproved newspaper was considered the truth and everything else was considered lies. Obviously, the New World Order socialist narrative would be the only truth under a system such as this, and traditional and conservative views would be relentlessly silenced Check out what The Messiah said in Berlin recently. In an age where theres so much active misinformation, and its packaged very well, and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television, where some overzealousness on the part of a US official is equated with constant and severe repression elsewhere, if everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we wont know what to protect. If we cant discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems. The fact he is saying these things should frighten you. It should also make you angry. This statement is a PC way of saying the goal of the power structure is to shut us the fuck up. They want us to listen to clueless journalists who encourage the idea of microchipping your children and later, yourselves so every aspect of your life can be controlled by the government. We must fight back by discrediting the fake news narrative at every turn and informing those who will listen of the possibility of a fake Internet 9/11 designed to give the government a reason to curb free expression on the very Libertarian Internet of today.",hate
"What motivates you to live What is the meaning of lifeFor centuries, mankind has questioned everything. Mankinds quest for the answer to what drives us, and what pushes us forward in times of darkness is not exempt from analysis. In fact, its been a consistent theme since the dawn of time. Stoicism , although not directly attributed to answering what drives us, skirts around the topic and creates a general set of principles to help us deal with negative externalities in life.While many philosophers have pontificated on the subject of mankinds driving force, and the will to live, theres a problem inherent with such an analysis. In order to research such a basic, and instinctual topic, one needs to experience a visceral, cerebral experience that brings him or her to a basic, instinctual level, before having such an epiphany. One needs to examine our animalistic base, and then explore logically from there.One such analysis is known as Logotherapy, from the Greek word logoswise . Logotherapy, developed by Viktor Frankl, is an influential school of psychotherapy, that is founded on the pillars of what motivates mankind. Before we delve into Logotherapy, however, its important that we discuss Viktor Franklwho he was, and why his unique perspective provides for an incredibly powerful source of credibility and authority.Viktor Frankl was born in 1905, in what was at that time known as AustriaHungary. Frankl was a neurologist, and psychiatrist. His early life was relatively unspectacular, but from an early age he displayed an interest in philosophy, as well as psychotherapy. Initially interested in Freud and Adlers work, he began to see their faults, and eventually diverged from their teachingsbecoming particularly interested in depression, as well as suicide.During 19331937, Frankl, in completing his residency in neurology, was responsible for setting up the Selbstmrderpavillon , translated in English to the suicide pavilion. Its estimated that Frankl, along with his staff, treated upwards of 30,000 women who had suicidal tendencies.In September of 1942, his life was shaken. Frankl, along with his wife and family, were deported to a Nazi concentration camp, known as Theresienstadt ghetto. Whilst there, and during his stay at Auschwitz, Frankl worked as a doctor in the psychiatric care unit, focusing on mental health, helping newcomers deal with shock and grief.In 1946, after three years in a concentration camp, Frankl released his book entitled Mans Search for Meaning , which details his experiences as a holocaust survivor, as well as his theory, which became known as Logotherapy. The book is divided into two partspart one is a detailed account of his experiences, whereas part two discusses Logotherapy.His time in the numerous concentration camps began to shape his philosophical, and psychiatric theory. While he had read books on the subject of psychological healing prior to his imprisonment, he had never experienced it to the degree in which he had become accustomed to. Particularly intrigued as to why some prisoners lived longer than others, Frankl began to organize his thoughts and document how the average prisoners life in a concentration camp was reflected in their mind. As a doctor focusing on grief and shockstricken inmates, he was in a very unique position.Hundreds, and during some weeks thousands, of helpless inmates were carted in Auschwitz, the mostfeared concentration camp, weekly. Between the inmates sleeping next to him, and those seeking treatment, Frankl noted that each prisoner, without exception faced three stages of psychological reactions once entering the concentration camp. These stages were shock, apathy, and depersonalization.While seemingly unimportant, the noted documentation of these stages was very important for Frankl. As he began to notice, while every inmate experienced these stages, some experienced them to a less cerebral degree. Some inmates seemed less depressive than others, and featured a happier disposition. These inmateswith some expected variabilityoutlived the other inmates.Discovery As he began to poke and prod, Frankl noticed something that separated these individuals from others hope. There is never not meaning in life. Every moment no matter how painful, dehumanizing or horrendous it is, has meaning. By extension, Frankl suggests, even suffering is meaningful. The inmates that survived the longestthe ones that outlived the rest, had hope. Frankl suggested that he could tell whether or not an inmate would live just by looking at their facesthe face of a dejected, depressed inmate was obvious and clear as day. Without hope, they were doomed.Everything can be taken from a man but one thing the last of the human freedomsto choose ones attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose ones own way.The next question that Frankl sought to answer was an important one, and the foundational maxim of Logotherapywhy did some men have hope, and others notThe answer, was love.The truth  that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which Man can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart The salvation of Man is through love and in love. I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved.Frankl, in his book Mans Search for Meaning recounted several instances where he would be driven into brief stints of depression after a beating, during a latenight march in bare feet, or watching his friend get treated inhumanely. Hed vacillate from depression by thinking, and longing for his wife. The men whom lasted the longest, invariably had a wife, or a job that they loved. It was this motivator, the unquantifiable love, that pushed men in inhuman circumstances to existentially escape the physical realm, and put mind above body.What we can get from this To answer this, Frankl codified three ways that he discovered is how we can find meaning in life  A job, love, and how we react to suffering. Its important to realize that while its easy to read this and assume that Frankl is saying we should all suffer in order to find meaninghes not. He IS suggesting, however, that should we not have a job/deed, or love that allow us to find meaning in life, we can still find meaning by choosing how to react in a negative situationour mental freedom is one of the only things that can never be taken from us, theoretically speaking.The average man will never be faced with such a dire circumstance such as the atrocities that Frankl and so many others dealt with. What we can do, however, is choose how we react to lifes adversities.A fair assessment of Logotherapy is that it provides a simplistic solution to a complex question life. Since life is such a complex series of events, Logotherapy offers a solution that may not be representative of lifes true hardships and intricacies. In saying this, my own personal evaluation is that, this criticism in itself may have flaws, by assuming that a complex question must have a complex solution. Even the assumption that life in complex can be debated. Its a cliched saying that life is hard, or complexand even if it is, its not out of the realm of possibility that a complex question has a simple solution  sometimes the answer we seek is right in front of us.Viktor Frankl died in September 1997, and his works are still read today. Several Logotherapy institutes exist today named after him.Read more Does Life Have Inherent Meaning Without Belief In God ",hate
"What would you do if you saw two boys of 6 years wrestling Their shirts off, red and sweaty, they have a large group of peers around them, cheering, eyes wide and knuckles white. Would you stop them or give the young scraps some advice Do you see a violent squabble or boys acting on natural impulses which will better equip them to defend their family and neighbours later in life The answer you give is, in large part, dependent on your gender so, the fact that this scenario would make an increasingly large number of men upset is a sign of a collapsing civilization. But, nil desperandum , Western civilization has the solutionMere horseplayAs an early years professional, I saw education academics acknowledging the databoys need rough and tumble play for their mental and physical wellbeing But they have no way of encouraging this in institutions where boys are immediately reprimanded for making fingerpistols at each other. Without saying it directly, they thought that the majority female teaching staff for younger age ranges were pushing our boys natural urge to fight like lioncubs underground. Whats more, the boys were made to feel bad about themselves and their very nature.Their solution They suggested that more men be encouraged to teach younger children and engage in rough play with them. Until the late 1800s, education was male dominated and boys spent a lot of time with male mentors. But, of course, there has been no effort to bring back that environment. Instead, a compromise between boys being boys and boys being fairy princesses was achievedplaying superheroes.As though female teachers are going to tone down the disapproval as the boys shoot lasers and magic at each other. The treacherous political class present only feeble attempts to manage the symptoms of our societal masculinity problem like sticking some tape over the burst pipe of our hemorrhaging testosterone as cultural marxism continues to swing the pickaxe of nthwave feminism at it. So, its high time we took a few swings back.But, first, we need to teach our lads how to fight. At the age of 6 or 7, Viking children were taught the martial art of Glima. This was not just father and son playfighting boys and occasionally girls already wrestle with friends and family up to that age. This was more systematic, a group activity.The Greeks also taught their boys how to wrestle because our other ancestors could see the big picture. The Hoplites, for example, were individualistic free men of all ages who voluntarily came together to practise combat this not only strengthened their communities but also allowed these farmers to fend off the Persian Empire. Yet, today, even isolated expressions of violence in computer games are questioned by SJWs. Nevertheless, all the signs are thereour boys are yearning for the same activities practised by their forefathers.At college, I started a unofficial fight clubmen only. This based in large part on the book and movie of the same name, in which the narrators Nietzschean alter ego, Tyler Durden, describes the bubbling frustration inside the everincreasing number of 30somethings coming together for underground fights Were a generation of men raised by women. Naturally, half the guys in my year were participating within a week. But, our young boys should be taught how to fight openly and without shame to avoid hidden expressions of violence and maybe even some massshootings by angry, loner teens. When they are young, it is the perfect time to teach them.Young lads have no intention of seriously injurying their friends its just good fun and produces healthier attitudes towards violence and confidence in selfdefence and the defence of ones community. Furthermore, a recent study has shown that fighting helps to strengthen peer relationships, meaning less bullying and segregation. It is interesting to compare the codes of honour of ancient Greek wrestling etc. with those we intuit as wrestling children.No intentional hitting or kicking No gouging the eyes or biting No going for the balls Thats precisely how I used to wrestle with my brothers and friends as a pup it was just obvious. If someone took things too far, they were ostracised from the fun, at least until they calmed down and apologised. If someone got hurt, we stopped, checked whether they were just being a pussy or needed to get themselves mended we kept calm and carried on.Were a generation of men raised by women.  Tyler DurdenThe data are screaming that men havent changed, especially our need to practise fighting. We still have the same natural impulses but their suppression, no, their demonisation has made our men weak and submissive. So much so, many are selfdeprecating betas who believe masculinity is toxic, full of white guilt and ashamed of Western civilization. We have everything to be proud of and need to encourage our boys fighting spirit so they grow some balls, some confidence in themselves and their kin. Thats the spirit which has kept our enemies, foreign and domestic at bay for thousands of years and will do the same to cultural Marxism, malevolent immigrants and anyone else who wants to have a go. If we want to turn scrapping boys into men first and gentlemen second, we need to organise some fights, not break them up.Read More A Short History On The Masculinity Of Fighting Save Save Save ",hate
"Earlier I skewered nine dictators, thugs, demagogues, and politicians adored by leftists despite considerable failings in policy, ethics, and hygiene. Here are six more overhyped figures revered by leftists who always get everything wrong.Franklin Delano Roosevelt How the world remembers FDR led America through the Great Depression and WWII, remembered fondly by seniors who heard his inspiring fireside chats.The ugly truth Some economists argue that FDRs measures prolonged the Great Depression . All the New Deal programs were struck down as unconstitutional, except Social Security. He got the Supreme Court to back off by threatening to pack the Court with more members with views to his liking. That restrained their judicial opinion, though the Constitution doesnt grant Congress the power to create a Federal retirement system.Social Security worksthough its slim pickings if its a retirees only incomeand for decades the surplus has been a cash cow offsetting Congressional overspending . However, the aging Baby Boomers who didnt have enough children might turn the cash cow into an albatross. Further, the Social Security Number is now a defacto universal ID number a convenient database field for monitoring citizens . Americas Founding Fathers would have been appalled at todays domestic spying , and the Soviet dictators of old would have wept with envy.FDR pledged to keep the USA out of WWII . Meanwhile, he quietly did everything possible to antagonize Japan, a oncefriendly nation, such as among several items freezing their assets and cutting off their oil supply. When he got intelligence of the upcoming attack on Pearl Harbor, he didnt order the base to be locked and loaded.If that wasnt bad enough So nearly a quarter million Americans died in battle, but at least the pivotal intervention came just in time to make the world safe for democracy, right Unfortunately, FDR was far too friendly with the USSR, giving them nearly 11 billion in food, weaponry, and other supplies about 119 billion adjusted for inflation.At the Yalta conference, FDR agreed to let Uncle Joe Stalin take over Eastern Europe. General Patton wanted to press forward at full speed to keep as much territory as possible away from Soviet tyranny, but politics hampered him every step of the way until he got rubbed out . When the Iron Curtain rose and the Cold War began, Winston Churchill said, We slaughtered the wrong pig. If only Roosevelt had listened to his generalsFDR wasnt a Communist, but many of his appointees and trusted advisers were. Later, Joseph McCarthy barely scratched the surface trying to get rid of them.Walter Cronkite How the world remembers He was a longtime CBS anchorman, reporting many triumphs and tragedies. A friendly face on living room TVs for decades, he became everyones Uncle Walter. According to polls, he was the most trusted man in America.The ugly truth Although a decent fellow in person, Cronkite was the archetypal bigname liberal journalist , spinning the news for decades. Sometimes it was rather subliminal, including his signature subtle sneer. Most of the public then believed journalists were muckrakers and unbiased truthtellers as Cronkites tagline went, And thats the way it is.Until Cronkites late career, the mainstream media had a veneer of respectabilityperhaps like warped plastic barely sticking to crumbling particleboard, but a veneer nonetheless. There once were only three American corporate TV networks. From Manhattan, they were the publics information gatekeepers no other broadcast news besides shortwave radio was available. Baby Boomer liberals might get a bit mistyeyed remembering those days. Today, six megaconglomerates own 90 of the media, but at least the Internet lets us present our own perspectives and call out biased reporters .If that wasnt bad enough  His biggest whopper was about the Tet Offensive. The Viet Cong launched a desperate allout assault, suffered very heavy losses, mostly it was over within a day, and ultimately the VC gained no territory. However, the most trusted man in America gave them a propaganda victory, reporting that the Vietnam War was hopeless. Public opinion promptly turned against the war. Ho Chi Minh shouldve given Cronkite a medal, an honorary VC generalship, and a dozen roses.Many forget that the 1973 Paris Accords brought peace. Two years later, though, the shaky Ford administration couldnt persuade Congress to respond appropriately to a Shit Test by North Vietnam. Then they invaded, and Saigon fell. All thats a long story, but public opinion from biased reporting certainly didnt help. That affected Americas prestige abroad, along with the lives of millions of South Vietnamese killed or sent to reeducation camps .Allen Ginsberg How the world remembers He was a pioneer of the beatniks, much beloved by the hippies who followed, and lauded with several literary prizes. Some even credit him with basically starting the 1960s counterculture singlehandedly.The ugly truth Ginsberg was neurotic and a degenerate. He wrote a socalled poem about his sphincter yes, really but the rest isnt much better. Anyone considering his bathroom wall ravings as profound either is educated beyond his ability to comprehend, believed the hype and didnt read it, or dropped too much acid.Howl, his bestknown poem, begins I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness. A brief excerpt get some brain bleach describing these best mindswho burned cigarette holes in their arms protesting the narcotic tobacco haze of Capitalism,who distributed Supercommunist pamphlets in Union Square weeping and undressing while the sirens of Los Alamos wailed them down, and wailed down Wall, and the Staten Island ferry also wailed,who broke down crying in white gymnasiums naked and trembling before the machinery of other skeletons,who bit detectives in the neck and shrieked with delight in policecars for committing no crime but their own wild cooking pederasty and intoxication,who howled on their knees in the subway and were dragged off the roof waving genitals and manuscripts,who let themselves be fucked in the ass by saintly motorcyclists, and screamed with joy,who blew and were blown by those human seraphim, the sailors, caresses of Atlantic and Caribbean love,who balled in the morning in the evenings in rosegardens and the grass of public parks and cemeteries scattering their semen freely to whomever come who may, Even overlooking the lunacy, buggery, and butthurt, Ginsbergs free verse is stylistically lazy. Back when poetry meant Keats and Kipling, it rhymed and had meter.He was a noted critic of the USA, for exampleAmerica, I used to be a communist when I was a kid Im not sorryGinsberg visited several Communist countries, getting himself deported from some of them for immorality. He abandoned his ancestral faith for Buddhism and had a Hare Krishna phase. What people believe is up to them, of course, but adding these two things upalong with his wretched poetryreveals a tortured soul. Rejecting everything one belongs to is childish rebellion for rebellions sake.Granted, Ginsbergs popularity was greatest during the screwedup kill your parents 1960s. Still, what were those who promoted his crapulous drivel smoking Were the literary gatekeepers pushing cultural Marxism running out of talented writersIf that wasnt bad enough Ginsberg joined the North American Man/Boy Love Association, sometimes speaking kindly on their behalf. Explaining in an accurately titled interviewPolitics, Pederasty and Consciousnessto the Harvard Crimson As I get older, having very specialised sexual tastes, it gets harder to make out I like young boys. Why Id have more chance at making out with younger guys if I were younger, dewier, dewylimbed.The media usually portrays pickup artists as reprobates, and screeched about Donald Trumps yearsold private locker room talk, but the presstitutes likewise the lefty intelligentsia fawningly praised Ginsberg despite his appetite for young boys .Ted Kennedy Best friends forever, east and westHow the world remembers He was the Lion of the Senate, representing Massachusetts from 1962 until his death in 2009. This champion of social justice carried on the Kennedy legacyhailed as Americas nobilityafter his two brothers were tragically slain.The ugly truth He was as passionate for booze and adultery as he was for social justice, but the suckers kept reelecting him. His lack of character sank way deeper, though all the way underwater.After a night of partying on Chappaquiddick Island, Ted Kennedy drove off a bridge. He escaped, but failed to help his passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne. Per one of the investigators, she suffocated slowly in an air pocket for about two hours. If hed ran to a nearby house for helprather than waiting nine hours to sober upshe wouldve survived. He got a two month suspended sentence, barely a slap on the wrist for vehicular manslaughter. The judge basically said poor Teddy had suffered enough. What about how Miss Kopechne suffered Theres one set of rules for the elites , and another for us. Shortly thereafter, he tried to spindoctor it with a woe is me shtick. The suckers kept reelecting him, though a Presidential bid was now beyond reach.As for his many legislative actions, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 was the most notorious. He promised the public First, our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually. Under the proposed bill, the present level of immigration remains substantially the same Secondly, the ethnic mix of this country will not be upset Contrary to the charges in some quarters, the bill will not inundate America with immigrants from any one country or area, or the most populated and deprived nations of Africa and Asia. In the final analysis, the ethnic pattern of immigration under the proposed measure is not expected to change as sharply as the critics seem to think The bill will not flood our cities with immigrants. It will not upset the ethnic mix of our society. It will not relax the standards of admission. It will not cause American workers to lose their jobs .The Lion of the Senate was lyin his fat ass off This population replacement policy threatens Americas future , just as the CoudenhoveKalergi Plan is doing in Europe. Still, the suckers kept reelecting him.If that wasnt bad enough Besides giving away the country to which the Constitution granted the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity , Lyin Ted was in cahoots with the KGB . He proposed to help his Soviet pal Yuri Andropov with tidying up the USSRs image problem during the Cold Wars endgame. The damning documents suggested that Walter Cronkite see above and Barbara Walters might be used for this effort. Conservatives often suspect liberals are soft on Communism little did they know how cozy Ted Kennedy was in bed with Comrade Andropov.John Lennon How the world remembers He was a talented musician, arguably the most prominent of the Beatles. Their story was an archetypal garage band becoming a bar band and eventually breaking out into great fame. Lennon produced dozens of hits that still get air play. Hes remembered as a wonderful man, an embodiment of the 1960s the good parts , anyway, and the conscience of the world.The ugly truth Despite Lennons considerable talents, not all his songs were excellent. Things slipped with the White Album . Revolution 9, really After the Beatles broke up, he started a solo career, often featuring songs with sophomoric political poses. His last album produced during his lifeafter dragging himself out of a long heroin stuporwas Double Fantasy . Critics at first agreed that it sucked. After a nut shot Lennon, they felt sorry for him and declared it brilliant.Lennon was the archetypal leftist celebrity using fame to push politics. Granted, everyone has a right to their opinion, but being able to sing or act confers no special political expertise. His song Imagine is particularly telling. As he put itImagine that there was no more religion, no more country, no more politics, is virtually the Communist Manifesto, even though Im not particularly a Communist and I do not belong to any movement.Being under the shadow of the Berlin Wall back in their bar gig days shouldve precluded sophomoric posturing like this.If that wasnt bad enough His failings are quite troubling, too numerous to fully detail. One item is abandoning his family the way his own father did. A truly wonderful man wouldnt do that.Another item was his extensive substance abuse. He spent 1974 guzzling booze, his lost weekend. One night, a waitress refused service because he stuck a menstrual pad on his head. ThenLennon Do you know who I amWaitress Yeah, youre some asshole with a Kotex on his forehead.One Lennon biographer asked Timothy Leary, whod been on hundreds of acid trips, what Lennons extreme LSD consumption would do. Leary had no idea Finally, what kind of inner vacuum caused this highly successful musician, much beloved by the public, to get himself strung out on heroinJimmy Carter In this heartwarming scene, Jimmy Carter and Uncle Fidel stand for the Cuban national anthem in HavanaHow the world remembers Carter is praised as a rare honest politician, exemplifying Christian principles and tolerance.The ugly truth The economy tanked during the Carter administration doubledigit inflation and high unemployment. Economists are still puzzled by stagflation normally, unemployment and inflation are inversely correlated. At least Obama gave economists another data point to study.Carters commendably not corrupt, but exemplified bleedinghearted liberalism. Despite winning the Nobel Peace Prize for not being George W. Bush likewise Al Gore and The Lightworker, Carter was a lackluster embarrassment. He was known for TMI statements, for example about his hemorrhoids and committing adultery in his heart at least Clinton had the balls to do it for real. He ranked lower than Mr. Whipple on a face recognition survey. The Boston Globe reported on one of his speeches with the headline More Mush From the Wimp finally journalists got something right.Carters shining foreign policy moment was the Camp David Accords, establishing peace between Egypt and Israel. America started giving over a billion annually to each party for making peace, which ironically supplies their military. Why The USA wasnt even a combatant, aside from the USS Liberty incident which certainly shouldnt inspire American tribute money. Taxpayers still fund this absurd protection racket.Worse, he badly bungled the Iran hostage crisis. One Iranian official later stated they wouldve released the hostages if the USA had threatened force in the beginning. Yep, Carter failed Irans Shit Test. Consequentially, the USA lost tons of international prestige, and the ordeal of the hostages dragged on unnecessarily.If that wasnt bad enough Carter is often a little too cordial with notorious dictators . Worse, Clinton trusted him to represent the USA during disarmament talks with North Korea. They gave him the Potemkin village show he bought it hook, line, and sinker. Yet again, Carter was played for a chumpthe USA opened its wallet and gave North Korea aid, and they pinkyswore to stop their nuclear program.

"0  items Only Geniuses  Schizophrenics Can Pass This 3 Question Quiz Many neuroscientists estimate that as much as 98 of all brain activity is unconscious. Just think about that for a second  98. All that unconscious activity is influenced heavily by the world around its subconscious cues. To demonstrate that, were going to call on a super cool quiz. The premise is simple only geniuses and schizophrenics can answer the following three questions. Which one are you Continue to find out There are no hints You either know it or you dont The test youve just done relies on what researchers call the contraposition method. This method tests the extent of a persons awareness and brain processing power. Its a super complicated method with tons of moving parts, so to speak, but heres what you need to know for the purpose of this article There are objects which one can reasonably say are unrelated. Most people would assume, for example, that a race car and a hurricane have very little connection. A genius who thinks outside of the box, however, would deduce some sort of connection. A schizophrenic patient would also deduce a connection because of the way the illness makes people see nonexistent connections in just about everything. In other words, if the quiz in this article left you scratching your head, youre normal. If not, one of two things is true  youre brilliant, or you have schizophrenia. Dont worry, I wont leave you guessing. Here are some facts that will help you figure out which one you are Geniuses will have taken their time to think before blurting a response. Did you get the answers right What do you think  are you a schizophrenic or a genius As far as the schizophrenia angle goes, this post is not a diagnostic tool. It can get you thinking about schizophrenia and, if you have concerns, you can see a psychiatrist for a proper evaluation. Sources ",junksci

"California becomes second state to raise legal smoking age to 21   Ethan A. Huff, staff writer Tags smoking age , California , prohibition NaturalNews If youre between the ages of 18 and 21, live in California and are a smoker, expect to be denied your favorite pack at the convenience store. Beginning in June, the new minimum age for officially jumped from 18 to 21, a prohibition move that lawmakers claim will curb the number of smokers in the Golden State, and ultimately help save lives.Joining both Hawaii and the city of Needham in Massachusetts, California is the third locale in the U.S. to raise the legal smoking age to 21. Officials there hope that, like in these other places, age restrictions on smoking will help reduce the number of smokers and minimize the number of individuals who develop smokingrelated health conditions like emphysema and lung cancer.Citing statistics from Needham that show a nearly 50 percent reduction in the number of smokers in the fiveyear period following the change that was made in 2005, April Roeseler, head of the California public health departments Tobacco Control Program, told the Los Angeles Times that she expects similar reductions in her state.In Needham, the number of high schoolers smoking cigarettes fell by nearly half, according to a study published last year. And adult smoking rates in the town also fell from about 18.1 percent to a mere 8 percent  statistics that experts say can be replicated all across the country.If we can push that age up where fewer and fewer people start smoking as a teen, its likely that we will start to have some tobaccofree generations , the Times quotes her as saying. Prohibition never works people who want contraband will find a way At this point, though, very little, if any, evidence exists to show that the rule change is working as intended. University of California, San Francisco UCSF professor Dr. Stanton Glantz, for instance, admitted to the Times that the policy still needs time to settle in. The California Smokers Helpline also says it hasnt noticed any increases in the number of callers in the prohibited age range trying to quit, which suggests that not much has changed.Theres also the contraband factor  older kids still buying cigarettes for younger kids, for example, including those younger than the former threshold age of 18. Illegal buying has always been an issue, law or no law, which is something that the government never really seems to understand when it comes to issues of prohibition .Theyre hanging out and partying together, so theyll just get someone else to buy, says Leonard Charles, the owner of a liquor store in Oakland. Charles says he strictly enforces the new cigarette age law, but believes that if somebody wants cigarettes, he or she is going to find a way, regardless of the law.In the internet age, cigarettes are also freely available to anybody with a WiFi connection. People can order cigarettes off the web and have them delivered right to their doorstep, which means that statelevel restrictions are basically moot.And what about ecigarettes The State of California classifies ecigs as a tobacco product just like cigarettes, and they are subject to the same laws. However, everybody has them these days, theyre very discreet, and they dont produce that typical tobacco smell thats so hard to get out of a room , so trying to enforce restrictions against their use is next to impossible, say experts familiar with the reality of how easy it is to obtain tobacco, regardless of what the law says.When asked how the new law will realistically work in light of the fact that smoking laws often arent effective, Glantz responded, The short answer is I dont know.

"Babies of obese mothers at high risk of brain damage, stroke, heart attack and asthma   Daniel Barker Tags parental obesity , children , health risks NaturalNews The growing number of babies born to obese mothers throughout the world face a higher risk of developing serious health problems in adulthood, according to several recent studies. Children of obese mothers are prone to brain damage, heart disease, stroke and asthma in adulthood, warn health experts.Obese parents pass on the tendency towards obesity to their children, creating a vicious cycle that warrants urgent action on the part of health officials, said the researchers of the new studies.The list of health risks is surprisingly long, including diseases like cancer, and conditions such as ADHD and autism .From The Guardian Four studies published in the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology make clear that the risks of maternal obesity include stillbirth, dangerously high blood pressure in pregnant women, diabetes in the mother or child, and complications during childbirth.The scale of obesity in women of childbearing age and the consequent dangers to health were so great that urgent action was needed to ensure women were a normal weight before they conceived, the authors say.Mothers being very heavily overweight could lead to their children having autism or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or developing cancer in later life, the researchers say.Between 2011 and 2012 in the United States , nearly a third of women at peak childbearing age 20 to 39 were obese, and 60 percent of American mothers were either overweight or obese at the time they conceived.In Britain, where obesity rates among women are the highest in Europe, 20 percent of mothers were already obese when they became pregnant. In 2013, 26 percent of women in England between the ages of 35 and 44 were obese, as were 18 percent of 24 to 35yearolds. Global obesity has reached pandemic proportions Obesity has reached pandemic proportions globally and its origins start in the womb, said Professor Lesley Regan, the president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.Regan pointed to the fact that more than 25 percent of men and women in the UK are obese, and that the one in five pregnant women who are obese face an increased risk of miscarriage, stillbirth and neonatal death as well as gestational diabetes, blood clots, preeclampsia, more complicated labours and severe bleeding after the birth.The researchers involved in the studies are concerned that the global obesity problem will only worsen, particularly in the developing world. It is estimated that more than 20 percent of women throughout the world will be dangerously overweight by 2025.One research paper warned of longterm profound public health implications, while another called for governments to begin treating obesity as a global public health priority.There is increasing evidence indicating that obesity during pregnancy can lead to a child being predisposed not only to developing diseases like type 2 diabetes and asthma, but also neurodevelopmental disorders like cerebral palsy.The complex interaction of neuroendocrine, metabolic, immune and inflammatory factors in obese women are believed to affect hormonal exposure and nutrient supply to fetuses, leading to possible brain damage in unborn children. Searching for solutions in a world dominated by fast food and sedentary lifestyles The experts all agree that something should be done, but there are no simple solutions. Increased education and guidance may be part of the answer, but a number of aspects of modern daytoday life are increasing the tendency towards becoming obese.Among these are an increasingly commercialised food supply i.e. junk food, reliance on cars and public transport, dangerous and overpopulated urban environments, and the tendency to sit in front of TV and computer screens for unhealthy periods of time.Ultimately, it is the responsibility of parents to lose weight before giving birth to children and to set a healthy example for children as they grow and develop. But in a world of fast food and smartphones, this may not prove to be so easily accomplished. Sources",junksci
"Nestle to launch new nonGMO products ... How shocked will Monsanto be Thursday, October 27, 2016 by Vicki Batts Tags GMOs , Nestle , Monsanto NaturalNews One of the food industrys most prominent players recently announced that they will be expanding their line of nonGMO products, due to the everincreasing customer demand for clean food. Nestle may have wowed consumers with their choice, but it may make some waves with their good friend, Monsanto .The company is broadening its product offerings to give consumers more options with no GMO ingredients and identifying these products with the SGSverified no GMO ingredients claim, the food giant stated on Tuesday.Nestle USA understands that consumers are seeking choice and many prefer to select products with no GMO ingredients, they declared.Of course, this is not Nestles first move towards GMOfree products. In April, Nestle announced that they would be removing GMO ingredients from six of their topselling ice cream products, as well. The company states it is trying to evolve along with consumer demands. It is great to see that companies are beginning to realize that consumers want options no one wants to be forced to buy GMO products.It is easy to want to applaud Nestle for their decision to continue to expand their line of nonGMO products. However, it is also clear that this company is doing so out of their own financial interests  not because they care about what people are eating. Organic, GMOfree foods are the newest trend, and smart manufacturers are beginning to see that they will not win anyone over by insisting that GM, pesticideladen food products are safe. If you cant beat em, join em, is a philosophy Nestle has clearly taken to heart.Nestle is not an angelic company, even if they have decided to start serving up GMOfree options. Just three years ago, they donated millions of dollars to prevent and oppose GMO labeling in Washington state, along with Monsanto and other biotech firms. Truth Out reports that on October 18, 2013, the Grocery Manufacturers of America disclosed that several of their largest, most powerful players silently donated large sums of money to oppose Initiative 522. This bill would have required grocery items containing GMO ingredients to be labeled as such. The group chose to voluntarily release the names of the silent donors, after Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson filed a lawsuit against their concealment of corporate donors.Nestle was among the top three highest contributors, and donated a cool 1.5 million to keep GMO ingredients under wraps and off product labels. Nestle also made a large donation to oppose similar legislation in California the year before, in 2012. The bill ultimately failed, after Big Food and Big Biotech joined forces and together raised a staggering 46 million to prevent its passing. And were supposed to believe they careThe controversial history of Nestle doesnt end with their consistent financial support of GMO labeling opposition efforts. It is a corporation that is wrought with wrongdoings and corrupt practices. Look no further than their outright theft of water in California.Given that the coastal state is currently being plagued by a devastating drought, you might be shocked to learn that just last year Nestle pumped a disturbing 36 million gallons of water out of one of the states water sources, known as Strawberry Creek. Peter Gleick, president of the Pacific Institute and author of Bottled and Sold The Story Behind Our Obsession with Bottled Water , estimates that Nestle is making millions of dollars in this way.Theyre converting a public resource into private profit, he told Los Angeles Magazine .The most shocking thing is that their permit to pump water from the creek expired in 1988. The forest service has allowed Nestle to gouge the creek for water at will, so long as they continue to pay a minuscule access fee. While bottled water accounts for only a small fraction of Californias water use, the overall environmental impact of what their practices are doing to a droughtstricken state have yet to be examined.Nestle has been subject to countless other controversies, including human rights violations, and has been host to many environmental and product safety issues.To put it simply Nestle may be trying to win over customers with their nonGMO products, but they dont deserve to. Monsanto may be shocked, but only because Nestle is still one of their own. Sources",junksci
"Meet the journalist facing 45 years in jail for filming the tar sands pipeline protest in North Dakota Thursday, October 27, 2016 by Natural News Editors Tags First Amendment , Dakota Pipeline , criminal journalism NaturalNews Are North Dakota authorities waging a war against the publics right to know about the ongoing Standing Rock pipeline protests We are joined by documentary filmmaker Deia Schlosberg, who was charged earlier this month with three felonies for filming an act of civil disobedience in which climate activists manually turned off the safety valves to stop the flow of tar sands oil through pipelines spanning the U.S. and Canada.The actions took place in Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota and Washington state. Schlosberg is an awardwinning filmmaker and was the producer of Josh Foxs recent documentary, How to Let Go of the World and Love All the Things Climate Cant Change. She was filming the action at a valve station owned by TransCanada in Walhalla, North Dakota. She was arrested along with the activists, and her footage was confiscated. Then she was charged with a Class A felony and two Class C felonieswhich combined carry a 45year maximum sentence.Article republished from DemocracyNow.org  TRANSCRIPT AMY GOODMAN But were joined right now in Los Angeles by Democracy Now video stream by Deia Schlosberg, the awardwinning documentary filmmaker, producer, who was arrested on October 11th in a different area of North Dakota, while reporting on a climate change protest in Walhalla, North Dakota, charged with three felonies, facing 45 years in prison, if convicted. Also with us, Josh Fox. His article in The Nation, The Arrest of Journalists and Filmmakers Covering the Dakota Pipeline is a Threat to Democracyand the Planet. His previous documentaries include Gasland, which first exposed the harms of the fracking industry, nominated for an Academy Award, also made Gasland 2, which aired on HBO.We welcome you both to Democracy Now Deia, describe what happened to you. DEIA SCHLOSBERG Well, on October 11th, I was working as a climate reporter, as Ive done for years and years and years, as Josh and I were doing, and the rest of the How to Let Go of the World team, when we made the film. And I was documenting people taking a stand, people on the frontlines of the fight to lessen the impacts of climate change. So, there werethere were five activists across four states that had planned to turn the emergency shutoff valves on the five pipelines that bring all Canadian oil sands into the U.S. And I was documenting this occurrence at the North Dakota site, outside of Walhalla, as you said. I wasI was filming the action. I was on public land. I was on a public road and at no point trespassed, at no point, you know, broke in or destroyed any property. I had nothing to do with the planning of the event. I was there to document it. I think its essential for journalists tojournalists and filmmakers to go where the mainstream media is not. And theres a major hole in the coverage of climate change and people that are already dealing with the consequences of climate change and people that are fighting climate change. So, I take that responsibility very seriously. AMY GOODMAN So when did the police come DEIA SCHLOSBERG The police came afterwell, the activist that was doing the action, Michael, had called the company ahead of time to say that he washe was going to shut off the valve, so they couldto give them ample time to take any emergency precautions. And then he turned the valve. And meanwhile, the company notified the local police. So, after the valve was closed, they came in probably about 15 minutes.

"Biological dentistry  Solving disease symptoms holistically Thursday, October 27, 2016 by Jonathan Landsman Tags biological dentistry , mercury amalgam , Griffin Cole NaturalNews When it comes to repairing cavities, amalgam  or silver  fillings have been the method of choice for most conventionallytrained dentists, accounting for 75 to 80 percent of all fillings. The problem is amalgam fillings contain mercury  one of the most toxic substances on the planet. Of course, the American Dental Association ADA continues to insist mercury fillings are safe,  even as biological dentistry warns the public about its link to neurological problems, cardiovascular disease and birth defects.Fortunately, nontoxic alternatives  such as those utilized by Dr. Griffin Cole, a leading expert in biological dentistry  do exist. Discover the healing benefits of biological dentistry and how to REVERSE disease symptoms naturally . On the next NaturalNews Talk Hour, Jonathan and Griffin Cole, DDS, NMD will explore the link between poor oral health and chronic disease.

Yet dentists across the nation continue to use mercury fillings for their patients  on a daily basis. Although the ADA insists combining mercury with other metals in the fillings renders it harmless, Dr. Cole maintains that this is not true  mercury heats up on contact with warm foods and beverages in the mouth, releasing vapors which are then inhaled by the lungs.An increasing number of dentists bill themselves as mercuryfree and mercurysafe. Although both oppose the use of mercury, they are not interchangeable. While mercuryfree dentists choose not to use mercurycontaining amalgams under any circumstances, mercurysafe dentists go a step farther  they are trained to remove existing mercury amalgams by using a specialized protocol advised by the International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology.This mercury removal protocol is designed to protect patients, staff and the environment involves the use of specialized tools, as well as precautions to ensure that mercury doesnt end up in wastewater.Join us for the next NaturalNews Talk Hour and discover what you need to know BEFORE your next visit to the dentist.

Ozone therapy is gaining ground as a natural, chemicalfree way of attacking infections, gum disease and other healththreatening dental problems.Gum disease, also called periodontal disease, affects a shocking 50 percent of all Americans. many experts say that number is much higher It not only affects the stability of teeth, but can lead to a chronic inflammatory state that depletes the bodys store of antioxidants and increases the risk of diabetes and heart problems. In fact, scientists have found that the bacteria responsible for gum disease , Streptococcus sanguis, can move through the bloodstream to the heart, causing inflammation and setting the stage for heart disease and stroke.By the way, antibiotics have little effect, Cole reports, as bacteria have shown they are able to mutate and quickly become resistant.In addition, traditionallyperformed root canals create their share of infections, as well. According to Dr. Cole, conventional root canals fail because the dentinal tubules cant be effectively cleaned, causing ongoing infection beneath the surface  even after tooth has been restored and looks intact.Join us for a great show about how Dr. Cole uses ozone therapy to kill infections plus many other ways to properly take care of your oral health to avoid disease.

"Tasmanian Devil Milk is capable of killing the most deadly superbugs Thursday, October 27, 2016 by David Gutierrez, staff writer Tags superbugs , drug resistance , Tasmanian Devils NaturalNews Milk from Tasmanian devils and other marsupials may be a natural cure for antibioticresistant infections, suggests a study conducted by researchers from the University of Sydney and published in the journal Scientific Reports. The researchers found that the milk contains no fewer than six compounds capable of killing some of the worlds worst superbugs .Unlike placental mammals including humans, which gestate their young within the mothers body, marsupials give birth after just a few weeks to highly immature offspring  mobile fetuses, essentially  that still need to complete significant development in their mothers pouch.In particular, the immune systems of newborn marsupials are highly underdeveloped. Because a marsupials pouch is a significantly less controlled environment than a placental mammals uterus, researchers wondered if newborn marsupials might need  and get  an extra immune boost. Six times as potent as human milk A previous study, conducted in 2015, cataloged many of the microbes that naturally make up the microbiome of the Tasmanian devils pouch. These included several diseasecausing organisms.There are potential pathogens present in the devil microbiome, so the fact that the underdeveloped young in the pouch dont get sick was a clue something interesting was going on, coauthor Emma Peel said. Thats what inspired our most recent study.For the new study, the researchers analyzed the Tasmanian devils genome for genes coding for antimicrobial peptides called cathelicidins. They found that Tasmanian devil milk contains six different types of cathelicidin.For comparison, human milk, with all its antimicrobial and immuneboosting properties, contains just a single cathelicidin.The researchers artificially synthesized the peptides, then tested them against several known superbugs, including methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA and Enterococci. The peptides killed every type of microbe they were tested against. Although the researchers had expected to find some antimicrobial effect, the potency of the peptides surprised them.We showed that these devil peptides kill multidrug resistant bacteria, Peel said, which is really cool.Many marsupials have even more cathelicidins in their milk than Tasmanian devils. Wallabies have eight, for instance, while opossums a Western hemisphere species have 12.Preliminary results have also shown that similar antimicrobial peptides are found in koala milk. The global threat of superbugs Although MRSA has gotten most of the media attention, other superbugs such as Enterococci can also be highly dangerous. These bacteria  which, like MRSA, often naturally occur on or in the human body  can cause infections at several different sites. While such infections are minor if treated, Enterococci are growing increasingly antibiotic resistant.Health experts were alarmed recently when more strains of Enterococcus started turning up resistant to the antibiotic vancomycin.Vancomycin is a pretty potent antibiotic and if a bug is resistant to that, then there arent a lot of drug options available to you, Peel said.Margaret Chan, directorgeneral of the World Health Organization, recently called antibiotic resistance a fundamental threat to human health, development and security.And the United Kingdoms Review on Antimicrobial Resistance recently concluded that unless urgent action is taken to stem the spread of drug resistance , superbugs will kill 10 million people annually by 2050. Thats more than the combined death toll of cancer and diabetes.Shockingly, that review estimated deaths from only six varieties of superbug Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli, MRSA, HIV, TB and malaria.Researchers estimate that today, superbugs kill only 700,000 people a year. The number is expected to rise so dramatically due to the spread of drugresistance genes through microbial populations, combined with the ongoing evolution of resistance to new drugs.The Review on Antimicrobial Resistance also failed to estimate the deaths that would come from people being unable to gain medical care, such as surgery or cancer treatment, that would be lethal without the use of reliable antibiotics.

"Top doctors Chemotherapy one of dozens of procedures shown to give no benefit Thursday, October 27, 2016 by Vicki Batts Tags cancer , chemotherapy , ineffective medicine NaturalNews Chemotherapy is arguably one of the medical industrys biggest frauds . Perhaps thats why it recently landed on a list of ineffectual treatments drawn up by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges AMRC.The list was created by 11 top specialists, who were each asked to think of five treatments they felt provided little to no patient benefits. And surprise, surprise  chemotherapy was one of them. Doctors from the AMRC said that chemotherapy cannot cure terminal cancer, and may bring unneeded distress in the final months of life. The Guardian reportedThe treatment is by its very nature toxic, the college said. Therefore, the combination of failing to achieve a response and causing toxicity can do more harm than good.Do more harm than good You dont say.Research has shown that in some hospitals, up to 50 percent of cancer patients are dying, not from their disease, but from chemotherapy drugs. For the first time ever, researchers actually looked at the numbers of patients who were dying within 30 days of chemotherapy administration , which could indicate that the treatment was the cause of death rather than the cancer. What they found was horrifying.The study, which was conducted by Public Health England and Cancer Research UK, found that the average 30day mortality rate across England was about 8.4 percent for lung cancer and 2.5 percent for breast cancer. But, in some hospitals, those numbers were much higher. For example, at Lancashire Teaching Hospitals, the 30 day mortality rate for palliative chemotherapy for lung cancer was 28 percent. In Milton Keynes, the death rate for lung cancer treatment soared up to 50.9 percent.The research revealed that the death rate for lung cancer patients was higher than average in several areas, including Blackpool, Coventry, Derby, South Tyneside, Surrey and Sussex.The data also revealed that about 1in5 people who underwent palliative care for breast cancer at Cambridge University Hospitals died because of chemotherapy treatment.Of course, the industry was quick to defend their practices, with doctors suggesting that these occurrences could simply be the outcome of data problems, noting that even a few deaths could skew statistics.However, no one really argued with the fact that chemotherapy is indeed a toxin. It doesnt discriminate it kills cancerous cells and healthy cells  and therein lies the rub. It may kill the cancer, but not without increasing your risks of getting cancer again in the future.A 2004 study also found that cytotoxic chemotherapy does very little towards enhancing cancer survivors 5year survival rates. The research, which was led by scientists from the Department of Radiation Oncology at the Northern Sydney Cancer Centre of the Royal North Shore Hospital, located in Sydney, Australia, raised serious questions about the actual efficacy of curative and adjuvant chemotherapies.What they found was that in Australia chemo only contributed 2.3 percent to the 5year survival rate in adults, and in the U.S., that number dropped to 2.1 percent. These findings suggest that overall, chemotherapy truly provides very little benefit to any patients survival. In their conclusion, the study authors wrote, As the 5year relative survival rate for cancer in Australia is now over 60, it is clear that cytotoxic chemotherapy only makes a minor contribution to cancer survival. To justify the continued funding and availability of drugs used in cytotoxic chemotherapy, a rigorous evaluation of the costeffectiveness and impact on quality of life is urgently required.The AMRC urges doctors and patients to question whether or not particular treatments are necessary. After all, unwarranted and harmful treatments are truly anything but medicine . Sources",junksci
"Even Republican politicians and former politicians are telling Trump to knock off such talk .But, as usual, Trumps shrewdness and defiance of standard political decorum  in which the opposition party merely rolls over and surrenders in the face of Democratic pressure  is winning the day.None other than billionaire investor and longtime Democratic supporter George Soros has said that the fix is literally in for the election, in favor of Clinton  no matter how much of the popular vote, and from which battleground states, Trump captures.As reported by Top Right News and other outlets, during a recent interview with Bloomberg News , Soros  a Democrat megadonor  openly admitted that Trump will win the popular vote in a landslide.However, he said that none of that would matter, because a President Hillary Clinton is already a done deal.In the interview, which is now going viral, Soros says with certainty that Trump will take the popular vote, despite what the polls say now which are completely rigged to oversample Democrats , but not the Electoral College, which will go to Clinton.When the reporter asks if that is already a done deal  that Clinton will be our next president no matter what  Soros says yes, and nods his head.Is Soros just making a prediction out of overconfidence Or does he truly know something most of us dont knowIn a recent column , Natural News founder and editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, says that Soros and Democrats have bribed electoral college representatives in a bid to fix the election outcome in favor of Clinton. In truth, that would be the only way it could be done, short of massive voter fraud through electronic balloting, as some reports have already claimed .Adams further pointed out that Soros was one of the main money men behind the Black Lives Matter movement, which is being blamed for generating hatred and mistrust of police officers all around the country  some of which has led to the deaths of several officers already.Soros also funds leftwing websites and groups that locate, pay and deploy volunteer agitators at Trump rallies, to start fights and engage in physical violence against Trump supporters acts that the establishment media then blames on Trump .But arent electors legally obligated to cast a ballot for the presidential candidate who won the majority vote in that electors district No, theyre not. Ninenine percent of electors have done what theyre supposed to do throughout our history, but this is no ordinary election Per Archives.gov , there is no constitutional provision or federal law requiring electors to vote according to the results of the popular vote. Rather, these pledges fall into two categories State law and those who are bound by promises made to respective political parties.In the past, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution doesnt require electors to be completely free to cast ballots as they please and, therefore, respective political parties may extract pledges from electors to vote for the parties nominees, Archives.gov notes. Some state laws hold that faithless electors could be subjected to fines or disqualification for casting an invalid ballot, and could then be replaced by a substitute elector.The Supreme Court has not specifically ruled on the question of whether pledges and penalties for failure to vote as pledged may be enforced under the Constitution. No Elector has ever been prosecuted for failing to vote as pledged, said Archives.gov.The site notes that throughout our history, 99 percent of electors have voted as required. But this is no ordinary time, and its no ordinary election . And Democrats and the establishment media have already proven that they will do anything to stop a Trump presidency. Plus, establishment Republicans dont want Trump either, so you can bet they wouldnt balk at or challenge the buying off of electors. Sources",junksci
"Hospitals raise their prices despite public outcry from overburdened patients Thursday, October 27, 2016 by Ethan A. Huff, staff writer Tags hospital visits , rising prices , healthcare costs NaturalNews When word got out last year that a handful of hospitals throughout Florida were massively pricegouging their patients, experts predicted that the outrageous bills for services at these care facilities would quickly drop in response. But the exact opposite occurred, a new investigation has found, with many of these same hospitals not only charging the same ridiculous prices, but in some cases drastically more .Researchers from the University of Miami looked at hospital prices both before and after the media picked up on the issue, evaluating the billing schemes at some 50 of the priciest Florida hospitals to see how they may have changed. They looked at these hospitals total billing charges in the quarter of a year before news of the gouging first broke headlines, as well as in the quarter postheadlines.In a fiveyear period spanning from 20102015, Bayfront Health Dade City topped the list of Floridas most expensive hospitals, with price increases nearly doubling. Following were Kendall Regional Medical Center, Heart of Florida Regional Medical Center, North Okaloosa Medical Center and Sebastian River Medical Center.All of these facilities, and many others, despite having their names tarnished for taking advantage of patients, were found to still be charging the same or even higher prices in 2016, the researchers learned. Other than a minor setback of temporarily decreased share prices, these exploitative care facilities are continuing to get away with jacking their prices , and with no end in sight.We were thinking we would see a drop or lowering of some charges, Karoline Mortensen, coauthor of a study published in the Journal of Health Care Finance that looked at hospital prices both before and after the publicity, told The Washington Post WP . Theres nothing stopping them. Theyre not being held accountable to anyone. The insurance system is utterly broken, and uninsured patients are even worse off Part of the problem is that hospitals in most states can legally charge whatever they want for medical services because they know that a bulk of their patients insurance companies will simply foot the bill. Insurance companies are responsible for negotiating rates, which they typically do on behalf of patients, so in the end prices decrease, at least to some degree.But hospital costs are still prohibitively and unnecessarily expensive in many cases  especially for patients who dont have insurance, and who thus have nobody to advocate on their behalf for fairer pricing schemes. In the end, hospitals are raking their uninsured patients over the coals, while these patients have little at their disposal to fight this medical targetblankhttp//www.medicalchoice.news/medical tyranny.Even government programs like Medicare and Medicaid negotiate better pricing in order to decrease costs, and yet hospitals are still overcharging them at an everaccelerating rate. With the exception of Maryland and West Virginia, states have no regulatory functions in place to prevent such pricegouging, which is effectively ruining American healthcare.The other major factor is that among the http//www.naturalnews.com/hospitals.htmlho... included in the investigation only one operates as a nonprofit. The rest are forprofit companies that apparently care more about making money than they do about caring for patients while charging a fair and appropriate rate for medical services.As http//science.naturalnews.com/hospitals.htm... targetblankhospital charges continue to rise and the best path forward to address price transparency continues to elude policy makers and stakeholders, it is important to recognize that hospitals may not respond quickly to public exposure and these initiatives, the researchers concluded in their earlier study, which likely reflects trends all across the country.The primary causes of extremely high markups in http//www.naturalnews.com/hospital.htmlhos... markets are lack of price transparency and negotiating power of uninsured patients, outofnetwork patients, and other disadvantaged payers.

"STD infection rates reach alltime high in the United States Thursday, October 27, 2016 by Isabelle Z. Tags STDs , infection rates , disease pandemics NaturalNews The news keeps getting worse for a nation that is already known for embracing unhealthy habits, as the CDC reveals that the U.S. saw more reported cases of sexually transmitted diseases STDs last year than in any year in the countrys history.According to the CDCs annual report, the nations three most common STDs  gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis  rose between 2014 and 2015 to reach an alltime high.The number of primary and secondary syphilis cases that were reported increased by an alarming 19 percent, while gonorrhea rose by 12.8 percent and cases of chlamydia climbed by 5.9 percent. While all three of these diseases can be cured by antibiotics, the CDC says that most of these infections end up going undiagnosed and therefore untreated.More than 1.5 million new cases of chlamydia were reported last year, and two thirds of these were young people aged between 15 and 24. This disease can harm a womans reproductive system, and if left untreated, can adversely affect her fertility.Meanwhile, 395,216 new cases of gonorrhea were reported last year. This number might be lower than that of chlamydia, but this STD is particularly concerning, as its becoming increasingly difficult to treat. This summer, CDC scientists warned that the bacteria responsible for gonorrhea is developing resistance to the antibiotics that are normally used to treat it.Syphilis cases, which noted the biggest rise of the three main STDs, numbered 23,872 last year, with men who have sex with other men making up the majority of the new cases. Syphilis can have devastating effects, including blindness, stroke and stillbirth. There has also been a surge in newborns being born with syphilis after being infected by their mothers. Concerning lack of testing The director of the CDCs Division of STD Prevention, Dr. Gail Bolan, expressed concern that Americans are simply not getting the preventive services that they need. She believes that every pregnant woman needs to be routinely tested for syphilis, and bisexual and gay men who are sexually active should also get annual tests.Dr. Jonathan Mermin, director of the CDCs National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention, pointed out that half of all STDs are occurring in young people under the age of 25. Part of the problem among young people could be the mistaken belief that the better HIV treatment that is now available means condoms arent necessary.While socalled hookup apps have been shouldering a lot of blame for facilitating casual sex, experts believe that the surge in STDs is largely down to budget cuts to STD prevention and care programs at the local and state levels. More than half of such programs have been subjected to budget cuts in recent years, with a number of health departments closing STD clinics altogether.Dr. Bolan pointed out that more than 40 percent of health departments have reduced their clinic hours, screening and tracing of people who might have been infected with STDs. This means people could be living with STDs for a longer period, during which time they could potentially transmit them to even more people. These diseases all tend to have no obvious symptoms in their early stages, which means testing is vital to prevent their spread. The CDC reports that the economic burden this is causing the American healthcare system is almost 16 billion per year. Unhealthy habits destroying Americans health This uptick in STD cases is very concerning in a nation that is already noting unprecedented obesity rates. All of these statistics show an increasing inclination toward risky behavior  whether its eating an unhealthy diet or having unprotected sex  without any regard for the potential health repercussions. Its not just what Americans are doing that is so problematic its also what they are not doing, like exercising and eating a diet rich in organic fruits and vegetables .America is quickly gaining a reputation for being one of the unhealthiest nations in the world, and the government looking the other way on GMO dangers and cutting funding for STD clinics is only going to create even more of a health crisis.

"Beware You could be poisoning yourself by reheating these five foods Thursday, October 27, 2016 by Isabelle Z. Tags reheating , toxic food , foodborne illness NaturalNews Nothing beats a homecooked meal. Not only does food taste better when you prepare it yourself, but its also a lot healthier. Unfortunately, this can also be very timeconsuming depending on the dish in question, and todays hectic lifestyle means that a lot of us cant cook something special from scratch every day. If you dont want your family to have to resort to toxic fast food on your busy days, what can you doMaking enough homecooked food to last a few days sounds like a great idea on the surface because you can quickly microwave it, but the truth is that reheating certain foods can actually make you and your family quite ill . Here is a look at some of the foods that you need to be really careful about reheating. Rice According to the NHS, eating reheated rice can cause food poisoning. They explain that the reheating itself is not the culprit it actually has to do with how the rice was stored prior to reheating. Rice can sometimes contain spores of bacteria known as Bacillus cereus , which can cause food poisoning, and these spores can survive cooking. If rice is then left to sit at room temperature, the spores can grow into bacteria, which will multiply and could produce toxins that can cause vomiting and diarrhea.The NHS says that the likelihood of this happening increases with the amount of time the rice sat outside at room temperature. They advise serving rice right away after it has been cooked or else cooling it as quickly as possible  within no more than an hour. They also suggest reheating rice to the point where it is steaming, and avoiding storing it in the refrigerator for longer than one day. Potatoes Potatoes that have sat out at room temperature for several hours can not only lose their nutritional value, but they could also create the perfect conditions for botulism to grow. Uneaten potatoes should go directly to the fridge after cooking to help reduce the chances of this occurring. Chicken When you reheat cold chicken, the structure of its proteins is changed, which can cause digestive upset. If you have leftovers you cant bear to toss, reheat them slowly at a lower temperature on the stove or in the oven to help keep the chickens proteins intact. It must be steaming all the way through before you can serve it, so be sure to stir it every once in a while. Spinach Spinach is best eaten raw, but its okay to cook it if you plan to eat all of it immediately afterward. However, when cooked spinach is reheated, the nitrates in it break down into nitrites, turning one of the healthiest foods into something that is potentially toxic and can negatively impact the uptake of oxygen in the blood. Eggs It is not a good idea to repeatedly expose eggs to heat. Reheating them after theyve been fried or boiled using high temperatures can cause them to become toxic and upset your digestive tract. Moreover, their protein is destroyed when they are repeatedly exposed to heat. According to the FDA , cooked egg dishes should never be left outside of the fridge for more than two hours this drops to just one hour if the temperature is higher than 90 degrees F. Warm temperatures between 40 and 140 degrees provide the perfect environment for bacteria to grow.While most of us have reheated these foods and have not noticed any adverse effects, it is important to exercise caution if you plan to continue doing so in order to avoid poisoning yourself and your family or causing digestive issues. Tina Hanes of the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline suggests making sure your leftovers reach 165 degrees Fahrenheit when you reheat them, and you should use a food thermometer to verify this. Covering the food helps it retain moisture and boosts its chances of heating all the way through, which is vital for avoiding cooler pockets where bacteria can thrive. Finally, keep in mind that microwaves are particularly risky because they do not heat food evenly. Sources include",junksci

"Vermont fights the opioid epidemic by limiting prescribed painkillers Thursday, October 27, 2016 by Daniel Barker Tags prescriptions , opioids , Vermont NaturalNews Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin is planning to combat his states opioid problem by limiting the number of painkillers that can be prescribed.The governors proposal is part of his strategy to address what has become a severe crisis in Vermont over the past few years.In a statement, Shumlin saidVermont, and the rest of America, will not get a handle on the opiate and heroin addiction crisis until we confront headon the source of the problem FDAapproved opiates that are handed out like candy.Vermont doctors and providers have been on the leading edge of curbing the irrational exuberance with which opiates are handed out. These proposed limits will solidify that progress and help Vermont continue to lead the nation when it comes to combating this crisis. OxyContin lit the match that ignited Americas opiate and heroin addiction crisis Shumlin has been outspoken regarding the opioid epidemic , and believes that the easy availability of drugs like OxyContin and other powerful opioid painkillers is the driving factor behind the problem.In this years State of the State address, Shumlin castigated the FDA and Big Pharma over OxyContin, a drug which he said, lit the match that ignited Americas opiate and heroin addiction crisis.Just a few months ago, the FDA approved OxyContin for kids, he said. You cant make this stuff up. The 11 billion a year opiate industry in America knows no shame.The new guidelines are intended to limit the number of pills that can be prescribed  after a minor procedure, only nine to 12 pills would be included in the first prescription.Without such restrictions, the amount of pills prescribed can vary widely, according to state health commissioner, Harry Chen. This can lead to addiction or the potential for overdose. Chen said that in 2015, enough opioids were prescribed in Vermont to give every man, woman and child a bottle of 100 oxycodone tablets.The proposal would also require doctors to discuss the risks of opioid use with patients, and gain informed consent before prescribing painkillers. Doctors will be expected to discuss alternatives with their patients, requiring them to consider other treatments before opioids are prescribed, rather than as a last resort, said Chen. How Big Pharma created 2.1 million opioid addicts Waiting for the federal government to effectively tackle the opioid epidemic is a waste of time. For decades, the FDA and DEA looked the other way while Big Pharma quietly began turning a significant portion of the American public into drug addicts.Aggressive marketing by pharmaceutical companies led to the widespread use of opioids to manage longterm chronic pain  as opposed to using opioids only for acute pain or palliative purposes.Purdue  the maker of OxyContin  lied to the public, saying that the timerelease properties of its drug made it less addictive than other opioids. In 2007, Purdue pleaded guilty to having misled regulators, physicians and patients, and ended up paying 634 million in fines, but the epidemic continues.Opioid prescriptions in the U.S. more than doubled between 2000 and 2014, and there are an estimated 2.1 million American opioid abusers. More than 40 Americans die each day from prescription opioids, and all the federal government does is drag its feet and make promises.In fact, the FDA seems to be trying to make opioids even more available  to children, no lessIn 2015, the FDA approved the limited use of OxyContin for children between the ages of 11 and 16.None of this may seem too surprising when one takes into account the fact that Big Pharma spent nearly 900 million in lobbying and campaign contributions between 2006 and 2015.Until we can stop the flow of money from opioid sales into the pockets of drugmakers and politicians, we should expect the epidemic to continue unabated.

When a body is low on oxygen some cells start to replace it by fermenting sugar. A normal cell gets its energy through a process of respiration of oxygen, whereas a cancer cell does it through fermentation. Cardiovascular Health Hypertension is all too common, quite often as a result of stress. In order to lower the blood pressure, its important to decrease the stress levels . One of the oldest and most natural ways to do that is through deep, slow breathing. Not only does it calm your heart beat, but it allows the blood to flow at a more even pace. Research was conducted over a 30 year period that showed how proper breathing can prolong the lifespan , as well as increase general health. The Framingham study found a correlation between the vital capacity, meaning the largest amount of air that can be expelled from the lungs after a deep breath, and the lifespan of that person. An increased vital capacity means a potentially longer lifespan. Cure for Depression Brain needs oxygen to work, just like any other organ in the body. Stroke has a tendency to leave the body paralyzed as a result. One of the causes is the lack of oxygen supply to the brain during a stroke. This is an extreme example, but looking on a smaller scale there is a connection between improper breathing and depression. Long periods of even a slightly limited air supply to the body caused by improper breathing, can lead to a decrease in cognitive functions. Symptoms such brain fog, forgetfulness, lack of concentration and in the end depression are all interconnected. Increased Energy Levels Have you ever told someone youre tired and in return you were told to go for a walk or do a light exercise This is because the body converts oxygen into energy through a process called cellular respiration . When you inhale the air correctly, more of it gets to your body, thus increasing the energy levels through conversion. It is also one of the reasons why people who exercise on a regular basis are generally more energetic than those with sedentary lifestyles. Different Breathing Techniques There is a countless number of breathing techniques for different purposes and each one of them has its own benefits. Breathing exercises can lower or raise blood pressure, improve sleep, help with anxiety and much more. Yoga is one of the practices that incorporates breathing exercises called Pranayama as an essential part of the process. Coming from the East, its uncertain when exactly yoga originated, but there is evidence that it has been around for at least 5,000 years . Yogic breathing techniques have been applied for thousands of years, making them timeproof. I will share with you a couple of my favorite breathing techniques that I personally use in different situations. Best Body Detoxifier Kapalbhati is a breathing technique that detoxifies your body, opens up your nasal passages and allows your mind to concentrate.

"Keywords ban on marijuana , legalized marijuana , Marijuana benefits Long gone are the days where marijuana is seen as taboo. More and more states have been legalizing marijuana for medical useAlaska, California, DC, Delaware, Maine, Oregon, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New Jersey, New Mexico, Connecticut, Michigan, Maryland, Hawaii, Arizona, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Vermont while Colorado and Washington have made history by decriminalizing the plant completely. Besides the United States, many countries have also began legalizing the use of marijuana however, in some of these places, cultivating or transporting is still illegalCambodia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Italy, Estonia, Jamaica, Mexico, Nepalamong many others. After a Gallop poll was done, it showed that 58 percent of Americans are in favor of legalizing the natural plant. This is the first time in history that Americans are more in favor of legalizing, than criminalizing, the herb. Below are a few reasons why its time to legalize marijuana worldwide. Marijuana can be used to treat a variety of medical ailments. Did you know that marijuana helps in treating epileptic seizures It contains certain cannabinoids that have anticonvulsant properties, according to Katherine Mortati, MD, a neurologist serving at the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center , SUNY Downstate Medical Center . Furthermore, marijuana has been discovered to relieve nausea in cancer patients, increase appetite in HIV/AIDS patients, relax muscle tension and spasms and relieve chronic pain. It has a very low abuse risk. According to Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNNs Chief Medical Correspondent, around 9 to 10 percent of adult users become dependent on marijuana. This is much lower than the dependent 20 percent of cocaine users, 25 percent of addicted heroin users, and the 30 percent of dependent tobacco users. Cannabis can be a useful in treating insomnia. The number one cause of insomnia is stress, and marijuana aids in relaxation. A study done by the National Cancer Institute found that patients that ingested a cannabis plant extract spray reported a much more restful sleep. It has been researched that THC provides a subject with an easier time falling asleep, longer sleep, deeper sleep, and better breathing while sleeping. The National Institute on Drug Abuse and National Institutes of Health funded studies that reported that subjects were able to fall asleep easier and more quickly after consuming THC. Approximately 40 of Americans have admitted to using marijuana. With more and more Americans having admit to trying marijuana at least once in their lives, it has been shown that marijuana is less addictive than coffee. Because of this, more people are finding reasons to feel safer when trying the drug. No one has ever died from a marijuana overdose. There has never been any reported case of anyone ever fatally overdosing on marijuana, despite the large amounts of THC in their systems. Prescription drugs, on the other hand, have been responsible for over 25,000 deaths in 2014 according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse  while the Center for Disease Control and Prevention report that 6 Americans die every day from alcohol poisoning.

"Keywords Cardiovascular , diabetes , dietary fat , heart disease , sugar , sugar industry Sugar does not have a unique role in heart disease. When it comes to dietary claims made by the sugar industry, we need to take them with a grain of salt. Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco have uncovered documents and communications dating back as far as the 1960s, revealing that the SRF Sugar Research Foundation, now known as the Sugar Association funded research to serve its own interest to create a sweet image of sugar. At the time, heart disease was on the rise as was the consumption of dietary fat and sugar. Instead of trying to determine the true cause for the higher occurrence of the disease, the biased research focused everyones attention on fat. UCSFs finding, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, shows researchers at leading universities, including Harvard, were paid by the SRF in an effort to portray dietary fat as the major cause of heart disease. In the process, sugars role in the fatal disease has been ignored. Singing the Praises of LowFat Foods As a result of the biased research published in many esteemed publications, life in the second half of the 20th century was filled with misleading dietary recommendations and scary headlines. Warnings regarding the dangers of dietary fat ran rampant. Eating fat, especially the saturated variety, was equivalent to clogging your arteries. Even eating an egg, containing 5 grams of the forbidden macronutrient, was considered a luxury not to be indulged in more than once per week. Lowfat diets became the craze. In fact, lowfat labels decorated food packaging throughout groceries stores, from yoghurt aisles to frozen sections. Consumers felt good whenever they chose lowfat varieties over standard options. Yet this sense of wellbeing generated by the lowfat fad was unfounded. To add flavour to lowfat foods, sugar was the usual substitute. And the truth that has been uncovered is that sugar is a secret killer. It contributes not only to obesity and diabetes, but also to the leading cause of death worldwide cardiovascular disease CVD. A Time for Change Recently the sugar industrys funded research has been challenged by unbiased studies which reveal sugar to possess the unwelcome property previously, and falsely, attributed to fat it leads to atherosclerosis. JAMA Internal Medicine has published a study by a team of UCSF researchers showing that sugar, aside from causing diabetes and tooth decay, sets into motion several changes that bring on heart disease. In this study, the diets of 43 children were changed to replace added sugar with starch while maintaining the same amounts of protein, fat, complex carbohydrates, and total caloric intake. The results showed beneficial effects on LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels as well as diastolic blood pressure. Another study, undertaken by researchers from Saint Lukes Mid America Heart Institute and Albert Einstein College of Medicine and published in Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases, showed that consuming diets high in added sugar caused an increase in LDL bad cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglycerides while lowering HDL good cholesterol. The new research results have brought about a change in worldwide dietary guidelines. From governmental associations to medical organisations and private practitioners are warning consumers and patients about sugars toxicity. The U.S. Dietary Guidelines for 2015 to 2020 recommend that added sugars make up less than 10 percent of a persons daily calorie consumption. While the main reason for this recommendation is that added sugar constitutes empty calories and leads to a nutrientdeficient diet, the Guidelines also acknowledge that there is strong evidencelower intake of sources of added sugars are associated with reduced risk of CVD in adults. The American Heart Association warns that too much added sugar in your diet could significantly increase your risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. It recommends lowering dietary sugar intake even further to a maximum of 6 teaspoons and 9 teaspoons for women and men, respectively. How Can Something Sweet Be So Bad According to one cardiologist, Dr Stephen Sinatra, sugar delivers its damage to the cardiovascular system via a surge in insulin. High levels of insulin wreak havoc on blood vessels endothelial linings. An inflammatory response ensues, causing the walls of the blood vessels to become clogged. In this way, the stage is set for heart disease. Add to that the wellknown fact that sugar leads to diabetes, which raises the risk of heart disease, and the overall danger is compounded. Addictive Properties Exacerbate the Problem It seems that the sugar industry pushed us toward a secret killer just like the tobacco industry did. This notion seems even more valid in light of medical claims that sugar, like nicotine, is an addictive substance. In medical circles, addiction is an altered state of the brain which causes repetitive behaviour despite negative consequences. Experts state that studies on rats prove sugar to be more addictive than cocaine. When our bodies digest sugar, they release dopamine and opioids. These neurotransmitters play a key role in the brains reward centre, which in turn causes addiction to the same substance that set off too much activity in this pleasure circuit. So What Do We Do Now We need to gather public funding to carry out unbiased research on consumer goods, including foods. Food labels should allow consumers to identify easily how much added sugar is present in every food item. Every processed food item should not be allowed to contain more than 10 percent of its total calories from added sugars. Widespread education regarding sugars toxicity should reach from the classroom to our doctors offices. Everyone deserves the chance to break the cycle of sugar addiction. Sources",junksci

With no end in sight, farmers see their yields declining and are forced to drill more wells, pumping billions of gallons of water from the ground to irrigate their thirsty crops. Even before the drought, these groundwater reservoirs were already in a critically low state.Furthermore, droughtstricken farmers are forced to use more chemical fertilizers , which contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, which in their turn worsen the ongoing drought effects.And it doesnt stop there. The U.S. has a mindboggling food waste problem. As reported by ReFED, an organization that raises awareness of the excessive food waste problem, the U.S. spends 218 billion a year on growing, processing, transporting and disposing of 63 million tons of food that never make it to our kitchen tables.But there is hope. One team of entrepreneurs and investors may have found the solution to protecting our food chain, while addressing the issues of the ongoing drought and food wastage. The new miracle organic fertilizer California Safe Soil , a Californiabased fresh food recycling business, recently teamed up with KDC Agribusiness , an investment group that mainly focuses on sustainable and environmental technologies. Together, they have developed a new technology which may solve the water crisis, overfertilization and food wastage. The new fertilizer that they hope to bring to the market soon is both organic and waterrich. Tech Crunch reported that the commercialization of this miracle fertilizer might solve three problems our world faces today. Firstly, it puts food waste to better use without filling up the landfills that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Secondly, it enables farmers to use an organic fertilizer that doesnt pollute the environment. Lastly, farmers have to use less water, which is a welcome solution for the droughtstricken areas of our nation.This new organic and waterrich fertilizer is the result of years of hard work initiated by California Safe Soils founder, Dan Morash.Morash saw the food waste to energy facilities and realized that food has a lot of water in it... So if you burn it, you dont create the most efficient source of energy, said Justin Kamine, the driving force behind KDC Ag. From trash to food Leading scientists and engineers from California Safe Soil CSS based their organic and sustainable farming technology on our bodys digestive tract. It can process all types of fresh food waste, including dairy and meat, in just three hours.The food waste, picked up from grocery stores across the country, is mixed with a unique set of enzymes that breaks down waste material. The result is a liquid byproduct that can be used as an organic , nonchemical fertilizer, called HarvesttoHarvest H2H.At the moment, H2H is being utilized by farmers across the nation to fertilize about 15,000 acres of farmland. Because the fertilizer is a pasteurized pathogenfree liquid, farmers can easily apply it to their fields through their drip irrigation lines, which also minimizes the need to rotate crops, as soil nutrients can immediately be replenished after each crop cycle.Thirdparty field trials have already shown that farmers using H2H are benefiting from an increase in crop yield per acre. Additionally, theyre using 25 percent less water  which is good news for droughtstricken California  while reducing their need for the harmful nitrogenrich products they used before.  ",junksci
"Cook these six vegetables for even greater health benefits   raw food , cooking , vegetables NaturalNews To cook or not to cook has been a topic of heated debate among some health food advocates. Raw food junkies claim that eating foods in their most natural state is the answer to all our issues and diseases, cancer included. They believe that cooking destroys essential vitamins, live enzymes and antioxidants vital to our health.While nobody will dispute the fact that adding more raw, organic fruits and vegetables to our diet is essential for overall health and wellbeing, going raw all the way isnt always the best option either. A study published in the British Journal of Nutrition found that people who followed a strictly raw food diet had normal levels of vitamin A and betacarotene, but low levels of the antioxidant lycopene. As reported by Scientific American , high lycopene levels have been associated with a lower risk of cancer and heart attacks. According to Rui Hai Liu, an associate professor of food science at Cornell University, lycopene may be an even more potent antioxidant than vitamin C .It seems that some vegetables need a little heat to release their plant goodness. Most plants have a tough cellular structure. Lightly cooking these food makes it easier for the body to break down the plants thick cell walls, making nutrients more available for absorption .Read on to discover six foods that are healthier cooked. 1. Asparagus Lightly cooking asparagus spears makes it easier for the body to absorb cancerfighting vitamins such as vitamin A, C and E, as well as folate. Furthermore, higher levels of antioxidants, ferulic acid in particular, have been reported when this vegetable is cooked. 2. Carrots Betacarotene is the compound that gives carrots their vibrant orange color. The body converts betacarotene to vitamin A, which is vital for vision, reproduction, bone growth and immune health.Carrots, however, are sturdy vegetables and dont give up their nutrients that quickly. To get the most out of your carrots, Researchers at the University of Arkansas advise that higher levels of betacarotene are obtained when carrots are cooked. 3. Mushrooms According to Andrew Weil, M.D., mushrooms are indigestible when they are uncooked. He said that thoroughly heating them releases the nutrients they contain, including B vitamins, proteins and minerals, as well as compounds not found in other foods. 4. Pumpkin and other winter squash Not many people will eat raw pumpkin, unless it is put through a juicer , and that is just fine, since cooked pumpkin has been shown to be more nutritious. Just like carrots, pumpkins need a little heat to break down tougher cell walls and release their plant goodness. 5. Spinach Folate, vitamin C, niacin, riboflavin and potassium are more available in raw spinach. However, slightly cooking spinach increases the levels of vitamin A and E, fiber, zinc, thiamin, calcium, iron and protein  as well as essential carotenoids, such as betacarotene, lutein and zeaxanthin. 6. Tomatoes While cooking tomatoes reduces vitamin C levels, it also makes lycopene more available to the body. As mentioned earlier, lycopene has been linked to a lower risk of cancer and heart attacks. Vitamin C is an abundant vitamin, so it is well worth the loss.As you can see, raw isnt necessarily always best. However, if you love tomato or spinach salads and cant stand them cooked, that doesnt mean you should stop eating them raw. Whether you enjoy your veggies raw or cooked, the most important thing is that you are eating them in the first place.  ",junksci
"Australia to hunt down antivax nurses and prosecute them for disobeying the medical police state   Vicki Batts Tags vaccination , Australia , medical police state NaturalNews Is there some sort of race to see which country can eliminate the rights of its people first It is certainly beginning to feel like there must be something going on, since government overreach looks like it is reaching an alltime high across the world.While countries like Australia demonize other nations for their lack of progressiveness, recent developments suggest that its government is taking away peoples freedom to think for themselves, slowly but surely chipping away at those who have dissenting opinions. The evidence The newly released vaccination standards provided by The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia in response to what the organization described as, a small number of nurses and midwives promoting antivaccination via social media.In their statement, they wrote that the board was merely taking the time to make its expectations in regards to vaccination and vaccination advice very clear to registered nurses, enrolled nurses and midwives. The board expects all registered nurses, enrolled nurses and midwives to use the best available evidence in making practice decisions.This sentiment might have been acceptable, if it wasnt coupled with the organization also prompting people to tattle on each other. You see, the board is also urging members of the public to come forward and report nurses and midwives who may be expounding antivaccination beliefs. Surely anyone who goes against the grain deserves to be punishedIf the medical industry was as strictly regulated as it purports itself to be, perhaps so many people wouldnt be dying each year from medical errors. An estimated 18,000 to 54,000 people in Australia lose their lives to medical mistakes each year  but the industry continues to insist that its those pesky thoughts that are really putting people in jeopardy. How dare anyone want to help people and think for themselves at the same timeIn their statement, the board noted that any reports will not be taken lightly. The board will consider whether the nurse or midwife has breached their professional obligations and will treat these matters seriously.To make matters worse, not only will these brave nurses and midwives be reported by people who may once have been their friends or colleagues, but the promotion of what the government deems misleading or deceptive information is a serious offense.And boy, will they take it seriously. Under national law, the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency is able to prosecute anyone who commits such an act. While we all know that the true deception lies in the promotion of vaccines as a public health necessity, we also know that mainstream medicine will do anything to protect their precious immunizations.Dr. Hannah Dahlen, a professor of midwifery at the University of Western Sydney and the spokeswoman for the Australian College of Midwives, told The Guardian that nurses and midwives are respected individuals who play an important role in society, and that she believes that people take their advice quite seriously. She went on to say, I agree that they have a very serious obligation to provide the best available evidence, and it is of course concerning that some are taking to social media in order to express a position not backed by science.But are concerns about whats in vaccines really not backed by science Many people might say that continuing to ignore the evidence that there are horrible toxins like glyphosate and mercury in vaccines is what goes against science .In a rather ironic statement, Dahlen declared, The worry is the confirmation bias that can occur, because people might say There you go, this is proof that you cant even have an alternative opinion. It might in fact just give people more fuel for their belief systems.Legislating dissenting opinions into extinction, and persecuting those who are raising awareness about a very real problem is proof that alternative opinions are not allowed. Thats really all there is to it its biased, unjust and frankly, more befitting of the very governments Australia speaks out against. Sources",junksci
"NonGMO crop circles showing up in corn fields in Nebraska   Daniel Barker Tags antiGMO , crop circles , Our Little Rebellion NaturalNews An American company has hit on a novel way to promote its nonGMO corn snacks while raising awareness concerning the dominance of GM agriculture in the country  by using crop circles as an advertising medium.Our Little Rebellion  a company that sells a line of nonGMO corn snack products called PopCorners  has joined up with Nebraska farmer Jim McGowan to create a giant message in his cornfield urging people to Join The Corn Revolution.The 9acre crop artwork also features a largescale version of the PopCorners website address and the logo of the NonGMO Project, an organization that verifies Our Little Rebellions products.Courtney Pineau, associate director of the NonGMO Project, saidIts super creative  were really excited about it. Ive never really seen a brand undertake an endeavor like this, so thats one of the things that we really loved about it.The project involved some hightech GPS mapping, a crop circle artist and a week of handcutting corn by a team of 15 people.A drone camera captured the creation of the artwork, as seen in the video belowFifthgeneration farmer McGowan saidWere really excited to be able to see the whole circle here come into effect. Most of the time in production agriculture, its treated as a regular raw commodity and you dont even know what happens to it. To see the actual chain complete with this product from that field is really special.From Eco Salon The project seeks to draw attention to the baffling 92 percent of American corn acreage currently being grown with genetically modified seeds  and to Our Little Rebellions efforts to source the 20 million pounds of corn it uses annually from the other eight percent. Meeting a growing demand for nonGMO foods To manufacture its products, Our Little Rebellion has had to take a creative approach, partnering with dozens of small farmers like McGowan to restructure supply chains so that they can obtain enough nonGMO corn to keep production steady.The NonGMO Project says that the growing demand for nonGMO corn, soybean and canola is encouraging more farmers to plant nonGMO crops.Despite massive lobbying and propaganda campaigns on the part of the GM agriculture industry, Americans have consistently spoken out in favor of GMO labeling and the right to have a choice between purchasing GMO and nonGMO foods.There is a market for natural, organic, GMOfree foods , and those who are willing to put the time and effort into developing these products and the supply chains to support them are likely to be rewarded in the long run. GMO industry lies exposed, public now facing the truth Public awareness of the issues surrounding GMOs is growing. More people than ever now realize that the industry has failed to live up to its promise to feed a hungry world.GMO crop yields are not bigger, the GM agricultural model hurts small farmers and poisons the planet with glyphosate, and GM crosscontamination and the development of herbicideresistant superweeds are threatening the entire agricultural spectrum  and the public is finding out about it.The GMO deception is no longer sustainable, just as GM crops are not a part of a truly sustainable agricultural system. The sooner food producers realize that and begin giving the public what it wants  i.e. healthy, organicallyraised , sustainable food products  the more chance they will have to survive and thrive in an evolving and highly competitive marketplace.Smaller companies like Our Little Rebellion and established food giants like Dannon which recently made a pledge towards GMOlabeling transparency and introducing nonGMO products are likely to benefit over the long haul for having joined the nonGMO rebellion early on.The demand for healthy food is real, and the market will eventually be forced to meet that demand.

"Farm owner arrested for protesting Dakota Access Pipelines theft of her land   Vicki Batts Tags eminent domain , Dakota Access Pipeline , civil liberties NaturalNews There have been countless stories across the web that have documented those struggling to fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Native Americans, farmers, ranchers, landowners and environmental activists have joined together to oppose the pipeline and bring the project to a grinding halt.Just recently, 127 Native American activists were arrested at a construction site near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in North Dakota. Despite the corporate medias attempts to suppress information surrounding the controversial pipeline, concerns about the Dakota Access project have become increasingly visible.However, one issue has remained in the dark the governments abuse of eminent domain.Eminent domain is what gives the government the right to seize private, lawabiding citizens properties for public use. Normally this means a road, a school or another public structure that will be used by the citizens of a town or which in some way serves them. However, the government can also seize private land if they can prove that it will provide some sort of public good. This loophole  and yes, it is a loophole  has allowed our government to steal land from taxpayers for years, and then give it to a private citizen or company. Such is the case with the Dakota Access Pipeline.This pipeline is not a public project it is being conducted by a private company that will profit off their endeavors. And yet, in spite of all the land that will be destroyed and the people whose lives will be disrupted by this project, the government has still seen fit to steal land and give it to the pipelines creators under the guise of public good.In Iowa, a major conflict between farmers and the government has broken out. You see, the state government is trying to take their land, and consequently, their livelihoods, to make way for the pipeline .The states decision to hand over land owned by farmers to the Dakota Access LLC has been met with quite a lot of opposition  as it should have. Just last week, Calhoun County farmer Cyndy Coppola was arrested on her own property for protesting the governments usurpation of her own land .Apparently, they expected farmers to idly sit back and watch them steal what they worked so hard for.Cyndy Coppolas arrest has been ignored by the mainstream media, probably because it doesnt align with their narrative that Big Government knows best. An injurious move at best, her arrest highlights everything wrong with the way our government is being run.The theft of privately owned land simply cannot be ignored any longer  it is unconstitutional for the government to give a taxpaying citizens land to a multibillion dollar energy company so that they can make even more money. And it wont just be the oil and gas companies that profit off this disgusting display of government dozens of big banks and investment firms will also be taking home a piece of the pie. Food and Water Watch reported in September than 17 financial institutions loaned Dakota Access LLC a whopping 2.5 billion to launch their project. They noted that banks have also given a substantial number of resources to the Energy Transfer Family of companies, such as billiondollar credit lines and revolving credits. In total, a staggering 38 banks have given this corporation over 10 billion in loans and credits.How many of those banks do you think have ties to our government Goldman Sachs is on the list, as are several other infamous industry names.If you think the pipeline is being constructed to better our country, youre wrong. Its being constructed to make money for a group of elitist corporations  and they plan on taking down anyone and anything that stands in their way. Sources",junksci
"New PAN report warns of global contamination of health damaging glyphosate   Ethan A. Huff, staff writer Tags glyphosate , PAN report , toxicity NaturalNews The popular herbicide glyphosate, also known as Roundup, is far more toxic to humans than the chemical industry claims it is, a new report has found. The Pesticide Action Network PAN in a 96page document entitled Glyphosate , reveals how people all around the world are being systemically poisoned by glyphosate, and many of them are even dying.Aerial sprayings of the chemical across crop fields are said to be safe for humans, because the socalled shikimate pathway upon which the herbicide acts exists only in plants, and not in animals or humans. But the report highlights the fact that, regardless of the supposed nonexistence of this pathway in humans, glyphosate is sill wreaking havoc on human health .Some of the acute health effects of glyphosate exposure include gastrointestinal and skin infections, headaches, blistering on the skin, rapid heartbeat, elevated blood pressure, dizziness, numbness, insomnia, blurred vision, abdominal pain, chest pains, problems breathing, respiratory problems, sore throat and strange tastes in the mouth.Other lesserreported symptoms include problems staying balanced, cognitive abnormalities, impaired senses, muscle paralysis, peripheral neuropathy, decreased motor skills, chronic fatigue and abnormal body temperature. And none of this even touches on the longterm health effects of glyphosate exposure, which are significantly more problematic.According to the report, glyphosate directly interferes with numerous mammalian organs and biochemical pathways, including inhibition of numerous enzymes, metabolic disturbances and oxidative stress leading to excessive membrane lipid peroxidation, and cell and tissue damage. Furthermore, the report highlights genotoxicity and endocrine disruption that lead to chronic health and developmental effects. South American doctors confirm that glyphosate spraying is causing infertility, cancer Though U.S. doctors and health experts appear reluctant to report on their observances with glyphosate, their counterparts in South America have a lot to say on the subject. Doctors in Argentina, for instance, are reporting whats being described as a dramatic upsurge in longterm health effects where glyphosate is being sprayed on geneticallymodified soybean crops.Included in the list of effects are infertility, pregnancy problems, birth defects, respiratory disease and various forms of cancer. Epidemiological studies have established a link between glyphosate exposure and nonHodgkin lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, multiple myeloma and DNA damage. Even at very low concentrations, glyphosate has been shown to damage vital organs like the liver and kidney, as well as skin cells.Not only is glyphosate sprayed all over food crops during the growing season to kill weeds, but its also used as a preharvest desiccant to speed up the growing and harvesting process. According to the report, this process is used on wheat, cotton, various cereal grains, peas, and beans, as well as other crops.Its bad for the people who end up eating these food crops, but great for farmers and the chemical companies like Monsanto that they support when they purchase all that extra glyphosate. And the repercussions are startling. Glyphosate residues are now being found in womens breast milk, as well as in blood and urine. Even vaccines are starting to turn up as glyphosatecontaminated, which means developing babies are now being injected with this lethal poison.The PAN Report is extremely comprehensive and really needs to be mainstreamed so that food growers, in particular, can understand the harm they are doing to crops, the soil, the environment, wildlife, pollinators, water resources and humans, writes Catherine J. Frompovich for Natural Blaze .However, it will be up to consumers and farmers ... to make their concerns and priorities known about saving the planet and humankind from toxic chemicals in food, water and the air, if we are to survive toxic chemicals and their currently unavoidable poisonings.The full PAN report is available for free online here .

"Whether its John McCain, Mitt Romney or Donald Trump, Democrats always run War on Women tactic to destroy the Republican candidate   Natural News Editors Tags war on women , democrats , campaign tactic NaturalNews Single women are a crucial element of the Democrat constituency, pushed to the polls with a crude combination of scare tactics and pandering that would be comical if it wasnt so effective in election after election. We may pause to remark that Republicans should have been much more prepared for this in 2016, but we should also look back to 2012 because it was used in 2012, regardless of how absurd it was to suggest Mitt Romney was leading a War on Women.Article written by John Howard, republished from Breitbart.com Even some liberals are recognizing the absurdity, given the emergence of Strange New Respect for Romney this year. Of course this new respect is pure political opportunism  and dont be surprised to hear liberals complaining in future election that the conservative Republican presidential candidate isnt as candid and relaxed about social issues as Donald Trump was in the good old days of 2016.We should practice a little political opportunism of our own, and put the Lefts revised opinion of Romney to good use. What they said about him was absurd in almost every respect. Theyve wholeheartedly embraced his position on the geopolitical threat of Russia, which means theyre tacitly admitting Barack Obama didnt know what the hell he was talking about. They razz Trump about not paying enough taxes, but they didnt care a whit that Romney paid stupendous amounts of tax, plus vast charitable contributions.Most pertinently, they turned Mitt Romney into a misogynist clod, and his wife Ann Romney into an outoftouch Stepford Wife, on the thinnest of pretexts. Lefty polemicists today are acting like they were possessed by political demons when they spent the final weeks of the 2012 campaign shrieking about binders full of women , and now they cant quite remember what they were going on about.As for Mrs. Romney, she was unceremoniously stripped of her feminine identity by liberals and treated like a space alien because she dared to endorse stayathome motherhood. When a mild backlash ensued, the White House memorably denied one of its slander ninja by claiming to know several different people with the same name. 1, 2In the Democrat imagination and campaign ads, Republicans are constantly targeting American woman. You can draw a straight line from Anita Hills hit on Clarence Thomas in the Nineties, to journalist George Stephanopoulos ambushing the Republican presidential field with a bizarre question about contraceptives in the 2012 primary.Its all pure opportunism, not principle. Romney was a choirboy, so they claimed his policies revealed his secret inner misogynist beast. Trumps policies include a familyleave plan, a culturewar ceasefire declared by Peter Thiel at the GOP convention, and an unease with lateterm abortion that tracks with the majority of the country. Theres precious little that could be twisted into a War on Women narrative, even by the people who used Sandra Fluke to portray spending ten bucks on contraceptives as the equivalent of female slavery. Therefore, the Left ignores Trumps policies and hits his character, while Bill Freakin Clinton gets ready to move back into the White House.In the Nineties, Democrats argued that Clintons sexual abuses had nothing to do with how he governed, so discussing them was a silly distraction we all needed to MoveOn.org from, even when he was in the dock for perjury. Liberals of that election cycle laughed out loud at the notion Bill Clintons libido had any effect whatsoever on national policy. He was good for the abortion industry, so his treatment of actual women was irrelevant.Partisan feminism is at a strange crossroads, as the core feminist message of independence clashes with victim politics. Women are supposed to simultaneously feel strong, capable... and be utterly helpless before systemic male chauvinism. They can only achieve personal independence through total dependence on the Big Government, which is staffed and managed by the only men in America who supposedly arent looking to exploit them. Youre not to think about the bureaucrats who keep getting caught surfing for pornography on government computers. 3The great leftwing project to rewire society in defiance of biology has saddled America with devastating social problems, but thats not a problem for the social engineers. Indeed, its more of a feature than a bug.Everything from illegitimacy, to crime, to the enormous difficulty of raising children as a single mom becomes another opportunity for them to push increased government power on a fearful, atomized population, which is rapidly losing its ability to form nongovernment voluntary structures of enduring social value, such as thriving small businesses and stable marriages.The dirty little secret known to the Left all along, but denied vociferously by them until their plans were fully up and running, is that most of these societal changes hit women harder, due to everything from their voluntary career choices, to the realities of childrearing.So in the world liberals have made, single women become more anxious than ever, about everything from campus rape to the implicit bias of a systematically misogynist workplace, and they rush to government for protection from the harms caused by that abusive government.Read more at Breitbart.com",junksci
"CLAIM Watching scary movies could help boost your immune system and promote weight loss   Vicki Batts Tags scary movies , immune system , weight loss NaturalNews Who doesnt love a good horror flick, right There may actually be some health benefits to be found in watching scary movies, too. Experts say that when you watch something frightening, it engages your fight or flight response. This in turn raises the amount of adrenaline pumping through your veins, which can be pretty good for your body.Psychologist Mark Griffiths, a professor of behavioral addiction at Nottingham Trent University, says that there are a number of reasons why people typically seek out fearinducing films. While the desire to experience something unusual isnt totally health related, Griffiths also commented on the potential healthy release some people may experience. Watching such films may also be cathartic, providing an emotional release for pentup frustrations, he told the UKs Daily Mail .But there could be more to it than just that, at least according to some new research. Evidence indicates that the fear you experience while watching a scary movie could help to temporarily bolster your immune system .Scientists from Coventry University took blood samples from a group of test subjects before, during and after they either watched a scary movie or spent time in a quiet room. Their findings, which were published in the journal Stress , revealed that white blood cell counts were increased in those who saw the horror film . Normally, white blood cells respond in this way when there is a sign of infection.According to Natalie Riddell, an immunologist at University College London, this is all part of our evolutionary process, which has been geared to promote the survival of the individual. Getting scared can engage the fight or flight response, which in turn, causes the release of adrenaline.The surge of adrenaline then launches the immune system into action  leading to an increased white blood cell count.Thats not all adrenaline can do, either. The survival hormone also elevates your heart rate and boosts your metabolic rate  the speed at which your body burns calories. You may think that the number of calories you could burn by watching horror movies is negligible, but studies have shown that you can actually burn a surprising amount of energy just by being scared. Thats right, watching horror movies could help support your weight loss efforts.In 2012, researchers from the University of Westminster conducted an experiment to see how many calories volunteers could burn off while watching 10 classic scary films. On average, each film scared the participants into torching about 113 calories  which is equivalent to walking for about 30 minutes. The researchers found that the best horror movie for burning calories was none other than a classic Steven King film. Thats right, when people watched The Shining directed by Stanley Kubrick, they burned away a whopping 184 calories.The classic films Jaws and The Exorcist came in second and third place, respectively, for total calorie burning. Dr. Richard Mackenzie, senior lecturer and specialist in cell metabolism and physiology at the university commented that each of the 10 films sent hearts beating and pulses racing. He explained, As the pulse quickens and blood pumps around the body faster, the body experiences a surge in adrenaline. It is this release of fastacting adrenaline, produced during short bursts of intense stress or in this case, brought on by fear, which is known to lower the appetite, increase the basal metabolic rate and ultimately burn a higher level of calories.Overall, calorie burning increased by about onethird while the study participants watched the films. Of course, this doesnt mean that you should watch a movie instead of exercising or eating healthfully . But the next time you sit down to watch a movie, you might want to pick one from the horror genre. Sources",junksci
"Is too much screen time hurting your kids mental growth   Daniel Barker Tags children , screen time , limits NaturalNews In an effort to steer away from its previous onesizefitsall policy, the American Association of Pediatrics AAP has issued a new set of guidelines regarding how much time children should spend in front of television and computer screens.Until now, the AAP had recommended no more than two hours of screen time for children  regardless of their age, the type of content viewed or which medium was being used.Recognizing that such a blanket approach could not effectively address the issues at hand, the AAP has recently taken steps to broaden its policies.From Gizmodo.comIn a series of papers published today in the science journal Pediatrics, its clear that the AAP has significantly revised its thinking on the matter, breaking down media use according to all these criteria. And to support parents with these new recommendations, the AAP has published an interactive, online tool that families can use to create a personalized Family Media Use Plan. AAPs new screen time guidelines The new recommendations are aimed at the unique circumstances of various age groups. For example, the AAP recommends that children under 18 months should avoid screens altogether, except for limited occasions, such as social media sessions with grandparents.Children between the ages of 18 and 24 months may be introduced to digital media, but the content should be highquality programming, and watched together with parents.Kids between the ages of 2 and 5 should be limited to one hour of highquality programming, which also should be watched in the presence of parents.Parents should impose consistent limits on the time spent in front of a screen by children 6 and older, especially for entertainment purposes. Children should not be allowed to sleep with their smartphones, tablets, etc., and should have one mediafree hour before bedtime.Mediafree times such as during meals should be established, and mediafree zones in the household should be defined.Making sure kids get an hour of daily exercise and enough sleep at night is also part of the equation, according to the AAP. Parenting in the digital age aint easy As logical as these recommendations may sound, implementing them may not always be easy. Most parents know that limiting their kids online time isnt always easy, and many would be forced to admit that digital media can be a helpful tool in managing children Parents obviously want to raise healthy children who arent constantly glued to computer screens, but these devices are a godsend for those moments when a parent needs to make dinner, or when they simply need to go to the bathroom. ...When it comes to limiting screen time , theres a tradeoff between parental health, and the needs of a childand that needs to be acknowledged.Lets face it, smartphones play a big part in our childrens lives now, for better or for worse. There is also an age when a parent can no longer police a childs online activity without invading his or her privacy.The best thing a parent can do is to set consistent rules for younger childrens screen time, and to try to help them learn to use the technology without becoming hopelessly addicted to it.One way to accomplish that is by setting an example. How much time do you spend in front of a TV, computer or smartphone screen yourself in the presence of your childrenMany adults are as hopelessly addicted to digital media as their teens or children are. If you expect a child to limit their time online, you must be willing to do the same.You might even try doing something completely out of the ordinary, like reading a book to your child, or having your child read one to you.As crazy as it might sound, there was a time when such practices were common. ...

"Soy should not be consumed in significant quantities unless it has been fermented or otherwise traditionally processed industrially processed soy should be avoided   David Gutierrez, staff writer Tags soy , fermentation , phytoestrogens NaturalNews The recent history of soy in the Western diet has been a turbulent one, from its status as a nonfood item in the early 20th century through its transition to a health food in the last few decades of that century to current concerns over its high content of natural estrogen mimics.What many debates over the nature of soy fail to take into account is that soybased foods are neither healthy nor unhealthy it all depends on the processing.The soy bean itself is highly unhealthy for human consumption. In addition to potentially dangerous levels of phytoestrogens, it contains exceptionally high levels of chemicals that bind to the nutrients in the bean, preventing their absorption. Soy derivatives such as soy protein are even worse, as they are isolated from the rest of the nutrients in the bean and have usually been extracted with toxic chemicals.Traditional cultures developed two major ways to bypass this problem fermentation and curdling. Both are ancient techniques for changing the fundamental nutritional makeup of foods. These processes are what transform soy the dangerous food into the healthful products of tofu, tempeh, miso and soy sauce that have played a major role in the diets of many Asian cultures for hundreds of years.

The illusion of democracy Thanks to the complete abandonment of democracy and honest government in America, We the People now wake up each day as slaves living in a totalitarian dictatorship pretending to be a democracy , complete with a pretend press, a pretend judicial system, a pretend legislative branch and even a pretend central bank pumping out pretend currency.We turn on our televisions to watch pretend journalists named Stephanopoulos churn out pretend news that pretends Bill and Hillary Clinton are honest, affectionate, trustworthy elders instead of the phony frauds and crooks theyve really turned out to be. And then were blasted with pretend polls that claim the most unpopular woman in America  Hillary Clinton  is somehow ahead of Donald Trump by 12 points. Nobody believes the polls anymore... Every time REAL news breaks through the surface, the establishment tells us thats all fake. Wikileaks emails, were ridiculously told, arent real even though they are. Project Veritas videos have been edited, were told, as if that somehow negates the very clear words caught on video as they are uttered by Clinton operatives committing serious crimes. The only news thats real, were told, is the fabricated fake news planted in the New York Times by the Clinton campaign. A call to arrest and imprison the presstitutes that are defrauding America and destroying democracy In truth, the leftist media is staffed by presstitutes  media whores who have sold out to the Clintons in exchange for access to her bogus news releases i.e. planted false narratives. As reported by The Free Thought Project , all the following journalists are seditious whores who should no doubt be arrested, indicted and prosecuted for engaging in criminal collusion and racketeering with the ClintonsProgressive Helpers",junksci
"Lifting weights could ward off dementia and make you smarter   by Vicki Batts Tags weight lifting , dementia , brain health NaturalNews There are many reasons to partake in strength training weightbaring exercises are known for their health benefits. But, could lifting weights also boost your brain Recent research indicates that may just be the case.To begin the study, researchers asked a group of people aged 55 to 86 to engage in a mix of weight lifting and brain training exercises. All of the people who partook in the study had been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, which is a precursor to Alzheimers disease , and is an early sign of dementia.While this particular study did not examine whether the benefits of exercise could be extended to the general population, the results were quite impressive. Published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society , the study found that weightbaring exercises could indeed provide some brain benefits. The researchers found a casual relationship between an increase in muscle strength and an increase in brain function. On that basis, the team recommended that more people begin a strength training regime so that the worlds aging population can hopefully be a little healthier. It is currently projected that about 135 million people will have dementia by the year 2050.The same team behind this most recent research also published a paper in 2014 that revealed that weight training provided cognitive benefits to just about every area of the brain  something cognitive training failed to do.While discussing their most recent data, one of the studys researchers, Dr. Yorgi Mavros of Sydney University, commented, What we found in this followup study is that the improvement in cognition function was related to their muscle strength gains. The stronger people became, the greater the benefit for their brain.For the strength training, study participants were asked to lift weights that were equivalent to about 80 percent of their maximum capacity, twice a week for six months  similar to the way in which many athletes train. And, as the participants got stronger, the amount of weight they lifted went up as well, in order to maintain the desired 80 percent of their maximum effort.Brain scans revealed that certain regions of the brain actually increased in size for those who took part in the exercise regime. Dr. Mavros says that the benefits were profound enough to warrant recommending weight training for everyone.The more we can get people doing resistance training like weight lifting , the more likely we are to have a healthier ageing population, he told the Independent . Dr. Mavros also added that the best way to ensure that you get the most benefit from exercise is by maintaining a regular routine. Exercising frequently, and with some intensity, is key to getting the most out of what youre doing.This new research is not the first to suggest that exercise can provide benefits to brain health . The body of research linking physical exercise to better cognitive function has only continued to grow over the last several years. Science has indicated that in addition to better mental health, exercise can also promote both better memory and concentration.Dr. James Pickett, head of research at the Alzheimers Society, also had a few things to say about this new study. He noted, New research is beginning to unravel how physical exercise may have benefits for the brain as people get older. This study suggests that people with minor memory and thinking problems, known as mild cognitive impairment, may benefit from weight training to improve their brain health.Pickett also noted that while it is not yet clear if exercise can reverse dementia, they do know that it is one of the most important factors in its prevention. Along with being active, he says that not smoking and eating a healthy, balanced diet are all essential to reducing the risk. Sources",junksci

"By George Zapo Posted Friday, October 28, 2016 at 0804am EDT Keywords Atlanta , food , food waste , fresh food , Georgia , hunger , landfills , perishable food , Second Helpings Atlanta , volunteers , waste managment Food waste and hunger are enormous global, environmental, and public health problems. As overwhelming as these issues are, community groups, volunteers, local businesses, and organizations are working on trying to find a solution. What started as a social action project in 2004, a few members of a small community in metroAtlanta, Georgia took up the challenge to feed people in need and eliminate food waste. And theyre succeeding The project grew into a nonprofit organization with a team of more than 400 volunteer drivers, a network of more than 50 donors, and frontline agencies who feed the hungry on a daily basis. Amazingly, the entire group has rescued more than 5.5 million pounds of food  enough to provide 4.6 million meals. Heres more of this motivating, againstallodds story. Food Waste and Hunger About a third of the planets food goes to waste. Thats enough to feed two billion people. The United Nations Environment Programme UNEP and the World Resources Institute WRI report that about onethird of all food produced worldwide  worth around 1 trillion  are lost or wasted in food production and consumption systems. Furthermore, the Natural Resources Defense Council NRDC cites the following Forty percent of the food in the United States is never eaten. But at the same time, one in eight Americans struggles to put enough food on the table. Nearly 800 million people worldwide suffer from hunger . But according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, we squander enough food  globally, 2.9 trillion pounds a year  to feed every one of them more than twice over. In developing nations, much of the food is lost after harvest, because of the lack of refrigeration, good roads, and adequate storage facilities. On the other hand, developed nations waste more food when retailers order, display, or serve too much. Additionally, consumers waste food when they ignore leftovers in the back of their refrigerators  or toss perishable food out before it expires. More Alarming Statistics of Wasted Food Much of the wasted food in the U.S. ends up in landfills. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA reports that food waste is the second largest category of municipal solid waste sent to landfills in the United States. And it accounts for about 18 percent of the waste stream. Thats more than 30 million tons of food waste that the U.S. sends to the landfills each year. Additionally, according to NRDC, on average, people dining out leave 17 percent of meals uneaten and 55 percent of these potential leftovers are not taken home. In spite of the dismal statistics on food waste  and the struggles and pain hungry people endure  community groups, organizations, local businesses, and volunteers in metroAtlanta, Georgia are making headway in not wasting food and feeding people in need. People Are Fed, Perishable Food Not Wasted More than ten years ago, a few members of a community in metroAtlanta, Georgia took up the challenge to feed people in need and eliminate food waste. They wanted to take leftover fresh food from grocery stores and restaurants and quickly deliver it to agencies that provide food to families and individuals in need. Since the first delivery was made in 2004, the group has rescued more than 5.5 million pounds of food. And the group believes this figure equals enough to provide more than 4.6 million meals. As success mounted in eliminating food waste and feeding people in their community, the group established itself as a nonprofit organization called Second Helpings Atlanta . Now, Second Helpings Atlanta has 62 donors, 31 partner agencies, and a team of more than 400 volunteer drivers who pick up and drop off perishable food every day. Executive Director Joe Labriola says, The challenge is getting the food from those who have it to those who need it, and thats what we do. We play a very specific role. We do 125 scheduled pickups and deliveries a week. Weve gotten pretty good at this. Fresh Food versus NonPerishable Fresh food provides more nutrition than the nonperishable, processed diet that so many people eat  especially people with low or no income. One of Second Helpings Atlantas goals is to change that standard, offering fresh food that will ideally help prompt healthier eating habits. This year, the group has delivered 962,635 pounds of food and Labriola estimates they will pick up and deliver more than 1.3 million pounds by the end of the year. The reason were so focused on perishable food is that were providing nutrition to the diets of people who are surviving on processed food. Were breaking the cycle and hope that some of the health benefits of fresh food will start to kick in. According to Labriola, he sees no reason why this type of food waste program cant easily be adopted anywhere. He adds that 40 percent of the food produced in the U.S. is never consumed. And the average annual cost per household of food that is thrown out is 650. Twenty percent of people in Georgia live in a foodinsecure environment  meaning theyre not sure when theyre going to eat next. Its a pretty grim story, Labriola says. But if we rescue just 15 percent of that food, we can feed 25 million Americans. How its Working When people sign up to volunteer, theyre shown the available routes. Then theyre asked to choose the route that would work best with their location and schedule. Most pickups are regularly scheduled. However, the group often gets calls from people holding weddings, bar mitzvahs, or festivals  knowing there will be leftover food at the end of the night. Then, a call goes out to find a volunteer to help pickup and delivery the leftover food. Volunteer drivers make food deliveries every day of the year, except Christmas. Food pickups range in size  so people can pick them up no matter if they own a small sedan or a minivan. That way volunteering is within the reach of everyone. From the time a driver leaves home  stopping to pick up the food and drop it off at a partner agency  it usually takes no longer than 90 minutes for he or she to return home. Families Volunteer Quite often, entire families will volunteer and work together for the weekly delivery service. Labriola says families volunteering are instrumental to educating younger generations about hunger and food waste. For example, around Thanksgiving, a family with two young children met Labriola one day to pick up dozens of turkeys at a grocery store. The children looked amazed as they helped carry the delivery  birdbybird  from the store to the truck, and into the agency that would distribute them to families. Labriola told the kids they just helped feed 225 families. The children soon realized what they did. One of the children said, Thats as many kids that are in my school The exemplary work and dedication exhibited by volunteers in the metroAtlanta, Georgia community is a truly successful model of how to eliminate food waste and hunger. Perhaps more community groups, organizations, local businesses, and volunteers will consider following their worthy example. You might also like",junksci

"Keywords food packaging , packaging One of the major reasons why lots of people choose organic foods is to avoid exposure to chemicals. However, most of these organic foods, such as beans , often come in packaging which, if not done well, there are lots of chemicals present that can greatly interfere with the normal physiology especially if there is a wrong choice of packaging company. Various types of food packaging can possibly leach compounds into your food. Investigate your packaging, kitchen, and youll observe a lot of materials to be concerned about. Regardless of the possibility that youre for the most part a real food type of individual, you presumably have canned merchandise, oats, pastas, and granola bars packaged in plastic bags, plastic wrap and plastic storage in your washroom. Most by far of food and refreshment cans which seem, by all accounts, to be made of metals like steel and aluminum in reality are lined with BPA, BPS or deplorable substitutes like polyvinyl chloride PVC, which contains the known cancercausing agent vinyl chloride. Your canned soup, soda, significantly seltzer or juices are likely exposing you to BPA and different compounds youre in an ideal situation not ingesting. Even packaging made of evidently amiable paper might be lined with chemicals of concern like PFASs, which can be found in pizza boxes and the wrapping of slick takeout food. Extra chemicals from flame retardants to BPA have worked their way into our paper packaging as laudable efforts to recycle paper have presented a variety of different contaminants. The Environmental Working Group EWG has added yet another database to its arsenal of chemical data for consumers, permitting the individuals who need to avoid exposure to toxins to check for BPA in their food packaging. They built up the database since they contend that Consumers have a right to recognize whats in their food  particularly with regards to an ingredient, for example, BPA, that has been linked to cancer, infertility, mind, nervous system and cardiovascular abnormalities, diabetes, obesity and different genuine disorders. Theres no simple route for your average consumer to discover what their food is stuffed in, and little research demonstrating the amount of these chemicals migrate into our food. A wholefood, unpackaged eating regimen is your best safeguard against the chemicals in packaging. Also, it is very important to check the reputation of the packaging company and if they are positively or negatively rated. Since there are such a large number of unknowns with regards to packaging, your most solid option is to avoid it when conceivable. Proper packaging is can go a long way in ensuring that you retain the health of your body. One of the key things in making the packaging safe is by entrusting a packaging company that knows the importance of eliminating all chemicals in the food stuffs. There are packaging companies that are more careful when dealing with food. Packaging your foods wrongly and without proper care can not only pose a risk in your health, but it can ruin your name as the packaging company. Below are some of the ways that you can drastically reduce the harm that may arise during the food packaging.

"How to Survive a Nuclear Fallout Ad 72890  HBS Account  2149237058061490 http//blogs.naturalnews.com/survivenuclearfallout/ By Caleb Stephen Posted Friday, October 28, 2016 at 0754am EDT Keywords fallout , Nuclear , nuclear attack , nuclear attack survival , nuclear bomb , nuclear bomb survival , nuclear power , nuclear radiation , nuclear war , nuke , radiation , survival , tactical nuke With the ongoing tensions between the United States and Russia, fears of a nuclear World War 3 breaking out are running at an alltime high. With that in mind, I thought it needful to write an article on how to survive the aftermath of a nuclear fallout. Obviously we could discuss the likelihood of such an event occurring but that isnt within the scope of this article. Personally I believe that at this point in time, such a scenario is not at all far fetched, however the situation is very fluid and thus things could change at any time. Basically theres two main types of nuclear weapons out there. First, youve got what is known as the tactical nukes and then the intercontinental sort  the stuff that would basically flatten the earth. In that case theres no point even trying to survive that. Im going to be talking about how to survive a tactical nuke incident. #1. Dont be anywhere near ground zero Obviously the first step to surviving the initial explosion is to not be there in the first place. Of course, theres not a ton that you can do if you happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Youve just got to hope that you exit this world pretty quick  which would most certainly happen if youre anywhere close to ground zero. The tremendous heat and sheer force of the explosion is enough to kill anyone and flatten anything within an 8 km radius of the detonation site. The intense thermal radiation emitted by the flash of light at detonation is enough to blind you, burn your flesh and start fires in the impact zone. If youre outside when this happens and you happen to survive, you should take immediate cover in a building. If you get any debris on you, you should wash it off with soap and water as soon as possible. As a survivor of the initial explosion, you now have around 10 to 20 minutes to bail out of the area before a lethal amount of radiation fallout comes down from the mushroom cloud. In those 1020 minutes, you need to get at least 1.5 km 1 mile from the blast zone to survive the fallout however within 24 hours lethal radiation will spread with prevailing winds so keep moving to safety. You should feel for the wind and begin running perpendicular to it  not upwind or downwind. #2. Getting to shelter If you cant get out of ground zero for whatever reason, then you need to get to shelter as soon as possible. Get into the deepest underground basement that you can find, or the highest story above the 9th level if possible. If you are in the fallout zone, but safely sheltered, you need to remain there for at least 9 days. During this time, food and water should be carefully rationed and clothing layered up to prevent radiation. Really the best way to survive a nuclear event is to prepare for one. Remember the nuclear fallout shelters of the Cold War era Well thats what you need to be inside to survive. But not just any shelter. Its got to meet a number of different specifications which I am not going to go into because you can find plenty of information on that if you Google how to build a nuclear fallout shelter etc. #3. Personal protection measures Protecting your body from harmful radiation and fallout particles is your number one priority after getting to shelter. Like I said before, being prepared prior to such an event is very important which is why its a good idea to carry the gear Im going to talk about shortly inside a Go Bag that you can keep in your car, house or workplace. Some quick first aid tips It is necessary that all wounds should be covered to prevent contamination and the entry of radioactive particles. Any burns caused by radiation must first be washed and then normal burn first aid procedure should be followed. Now lets look at the gear you should have ready before a nuclear attack happens. Gas mask Youll need a gas mask to protect your face and respiratory system from airborne pathogens and chemical particles. Israeli Military Surplus M15 Gas Masks fitted with NATO 40 mm CBRN filters are some of the best and cheapest around, yet are getting harder and harder to find these days with huge supplies flying off the shelves in the relatively recent Ebola scar. I have the M15 civilian version of this gas mask and its extremely comfortable, has a port for a hydration tube and best of all its been tested in real life conditions in the Middle East. Military chemical suit These suits provide optimal protection from chemical and biological attacks and are used by the British army. These are surprisingly cheap yet are proven to work by soldiers whose lives depend on them in everyday combat situations. You can get these for around 25 from Amazon.com Gloves Youre going to need gloves to protect your hands from contact with chemical pathogens and biological particles. Long, chemical resistant gloves can be found online, at some supermarkets and hardware stores. You can get these at around 10  15 depending on the brand etc. Boots In order to have full protection from chemical and biological hazards, it is important to have a good pair of rubber overboots to protect your feet and legs from chemical and biological particles from coming into contact with your body. Ensure that you blouse your trousers inside your boots for maximum protection. Once again, these boots that I recommend are used by the UK military and you can get them on Amazon.com for around 25. Nuclear Protection There is a way to reduce the effects of nuclear radiation in your body. Its called Potassium Iodide and its available on Amazon for less than 10 for a pack of 14 tablets. What this basically does is it reduces the chances of harmful radioactive iodine from entering your thyroid glands. If you dont have any of these when a nuclear attack happens, you can improvise. As I mentioned before, clothing should be layered up to prevent radiation contact with the skin. Cover your eyes with closefitting sunglasses or improvised goggles. #4. Decontaminating food and water Water and food will be contaminated by debris from the nuclear fallout making procurement and consumption difficult, however it is not impossible to make them safe to consume. Whenever possible, try to use water that has been sealed in a container or bottle as you can safely assume that the water inside the sealed container is not contaminated. Wash the container thoroughly with soap and water or boil it for at least 10 minutes before breaking the seal. If water in sealed containers is not available, your next choice, only under emergency conditions, is water from springs. Again, boil the water for at least 10 minutes before drinking. Keep the water covered while boiling to prevent contamination by airborne pathogens. Your last choice only in an extreme emergency where sealed water and spring water are unavailable is to use standing water that found in small pools, ponds and basically any water that does not flow. Contaminants, microorganisms and germs can survive easily in stagnant water. First, boil this water as long as practical to kill all organisms. Next, filter it through a cloth to remove the nasties. In all cases mentioned above, use water purification tablets following all directions on the bottle/packaging after boiling and initial filtration prior to consumption. Like water, you can also assume that sealed containers or packages of processed food are safe. To ensure safety, decontaminate all food containers by washing with soap and water or by boiling the container in water for 10 minutes. This is where it helps to have a decent supply of sealed buckets and containers of militarystyle MREs and freezedried foods such as Wise Foods and Mountain House. You should consider supplementing your sealed rations with local plants, animals and produce only in extreme emergencies. Unfortunately, no matter what you do to prepare or decontaminate the food, there is no guarantee that cooking will kill all the biological agents. Remember, you can survive for a long time without food at least 3 weeks, but can be longer, especially if the food you eat may potentially kill you If you must use local food, select only healthylooking plants, animals, fruit and vegetables. Do not select known carriers of organisms such as rats or other vermin. Always use gloves and protective clothing when handling and dressing animals, plants etc. Cook all plant and animal food by boiling only. Boil all food for at least 10 minutes to kill all pathogens. Do not try to fry, bake, or roast local food as there is no guarantee that all infected portions have reached the required temperature to kill all pathogens. Do not eat raw food at all costs Obviously this article is nowhere near comprehensive, but I hope it gives you some idea of what you need to do in order to survive the aftermath of a nuclear attack. We can only hope and pray that such an event does not happen and that peace will prevail on this planet. You might also like",junksci
"Keywords cancer , diet , health , Health Benefits of Himalayan Salt lamp , mental health , Natural remedies , stress , Toxins The Himalayan Salt Lamps are made from Natural Himalayan Crystal Salt Rock formed millions of years ago in the foothills of Himalaya. Salt lamps are blocks of pure Himalayan salt, so they come from the same region of the world. Also known as the Vitamins of the Air, they are made from the salt that came from ancient oceans, and serve as a perfect air ionizer. How Himalayan Salt Lamps Work Himalayan salt lamps emit negative ions in the air which are healthy for the human body. The ionization is supported by the bulb inside of the salt block since the bulb heats the salt block around it. Himalayan salt attracts the water around it and this process called as hygroscopic. Therefore, the Himalayan salt lamps may become dump or wet, especially in an environment with high humidity. As the bulb heats the salt lamp, the water evaporates and the negative ions are released in the air. The negative ions bind with the positive harmful ions such as allergens, molds and bacteria, and neutralize the environment in the house. Improve Blood Flow Particular studies have suggested that negative ions, such as those emitted by Himalayan salt lamps, can accelerate blood flow. This boost helps to improve several disorders of the vascular system and can prevent certain damage to the lungs. Purify Air Dust, pollen, cigarette smoke and other pollutants ruin the purity of the air we breathe, and the perfect way to neutralize it is to use Himalayan salt lamp on your room. It acts as air purifier through its ability to absorb water and evaporating them after. They attract water molecules in the air, which traps impurities in the air and leaves you with fresh, clean air this is known as hygroscopy. Good Vibrations Salt has been used through out the ages to clean energies from homes and people. You can use Salt to clear crystals, clear your body and clear your home. Because Salt Crystals vibrate at a frequency closer to the earths magnetic frequency known as the shuman resonance frequency they can also help bring us back in balance. Boost Energy Levels Positive ions deplete the body of energy, and it is believed that Himalayan salt lamps can actually do the opposite. The negative ions increase energy levels, which yields a refreshing effect similar to the feeling of rejuvenation achieved from spending time in nature. Improve Your Breathing Asthma and other breathing complications can be triggered by polluted, corrupted air. Salt lamps ensure that you breathe cleaner air whenever you are around them, helping to improve breathing and prevent contaminants from entering your lungs. Other Benefits of Using Himalayan salt lamp Balancing pH to strengthening bones and lowering blood pressure Reduce morning sickness, some type of depression Reduce asthma attack and allergy symptoms Reduce allergic reaction",junksci

For all others, you may not need to see VAXXED first before you see UnVAXXED. A new film by awardwinning author and filmmaker, Dr. Leonard G. Horowitz, contributes more than the discussion actor Robert De Niro sought to prompt by screening the controversial film VAXXED at the 2016 Tribeca Film Festival in New York. De Niro, whose son, like millions of other children who became vaccineinjured, came under fire from both sides of the vaccination safety debate after pulling VAXXED from the event. Agents pressured the Hollywood celebrity to censor that film by producer Del Bigtree and director Andy Wakefield. De Niro later pledged to investigate who caused the censorship, and why. UnVaxxed A DocuCommentary for Robert DeNiro was the Overall Grand Jury Winner of Cinema Los Angeles, a Film Festival which takes place annually in central Los Angeles from November 12 nd . I saw the trailer and the filmmakers, Dr. Leonard Horowitz and Sherri Kane promise to continue the dialogue and contribute to the questions actor Robert De Niro asked while being interviewed on TODAY April 2016. He wanted answers and an investigation to the autism controversy around vaccines.

This awardwinning author, filmmaker, pharmaceutical industry critic, and intelligence industry analyst has published seventeen books and dozens of peer reviewed scientific articles. Dr. Horowitzs first of three American bestsellers, Emerging Viruses AIDS  EbolaNature, Accident or Intentional, is largely credited for prompting the global vaccination risk awareness movement. The book caused several governments to reconsider their immunization policies, and became the center of political debate in 2008 when Barack Obamas minister, Rev. Jeremiah Wright, credited Horowitz and this book for evidencing HIV/AIDS as a genocidal weapon of mass depopulation targeting Africans and African Americans courtesy of covert U.S. military contractors named in the publication. Dr. Horowitzs second bestseller, Healing Codes for the Biological Apocalypse, prompted a revolution in the music and natural healing industries.

"Compound found in onions has antiovarian cancer effects Sunday, October 30, 2016 by David Gutierrez, staff writer Tags cancer prevention , onions , quercetin NaturalNews A chemical naturally occurring in onions may be able to suppress the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells, and perhaps even initiate cancer cell death, according to a study conducted by researchers from Kumamoto University in Japan, and published in the journal Scientific Reports .These particular anticancer effects come from a chemical called onionin A ONA. The study focused on the effects of ONA on the most common form of ovarian cancer, epithelial ovarian cancer EOC. This type of cancer has a fiveyear survival rate of only 40 percent. It is the 10th most common female cancer in the United States, and the fifth most lethal form of cancer in women. As many as 80 percent of EOC patients relapse after their first course of chemotherapy. Kills cancer cells, suppresses tumor growth In a prior study, the researchers found that ONA suppressed the tumorpromoting activity of a type of white blood cells known as myeloid cells.In the new study, researchers further examined cellbased models of EOCs. Firstly, they found that the introduction of ONA caused EOC tumor growth to slow. Further examination showed that ONA was inhibiting the tumorboosting activities of myeloidderived suppressor cells MDSCs, thereby confirming the findings of the prior study.Previous research has suggested that in the presence of cancer, MDSCs may function to suppress antitumor activity by the rest of the immune system.The researchers also found that when combined with anticancer drugs, ONA boosted the ability of the drugs to block cancer proliferation.We found that ONA reduced the extent of ovarian cancer cell proliferation induced by coculture with human macrophages, the researchers wrote. In addition, we found that ONA directly suppressed cancer cell proliferation.The researchers then performed an additional experiment, giving mice with EOC oral treatment with ONA and comparing them with a control group. They found that the mice given ONA lived longer, and their tumors did not grow as aggressively. No side effects were observed from the treatment.The researchers concluded that with some additional testing, ONA could be used as an oral cancer treatment.ONA is considered useful for the additional treatment of patients with ovarian cancer owing to its suppression of the protumor activation of tumorassociated macrophages and direct cytotoxicity against cancer cells, they wrote.Studies have also linked onions to a lower risk of stomach and colorectal cancers. The overlooked superfood Scientists continue to uncover remarkable health benefits of the humble onion, which is a staple food in every culture in which it is found.The benefits of onions start simply with their nutrient profile These vegetables are highly nutrient dense, delivering high levels of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, with relatively few calories. A single cup of chopped onions contains 10 percent or more of the daily recommended amount of vitamin B6, vitamin C and manganese, and also contains calcium, folate, iron, magnesium, phosphorus and potassium. In addition to vitamin C, onions are high in other antioxidants, particularly quercetin . Antioxidants help protect the body from free radicals that cause chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer.Researchers attribute many of onions health benefits to quercetin, including lower blood pressure and improved cardiovascular health. Quercetin is also a potent antiinflammatory.Other benefits of onions may stem from some of the other nutrients it contains. Studies have shown that onions can help fight depression, an effect that may come in part from their high folate content. Folate helps prevent a buildup in the body of homocysteine, which in turn can suppress the production of moodregulating neurotransmitters. Excess homocysteine can also interfere with sleep and appetite.Onions are a versatile food. The entire plant is edible except for the small roots, and can be eaten in nearly any form. It can be cooked into recipes, added raw on top of salads or sandwiches, or used as an ingredient in dips and sauces. Sources for this article include",junksci
"Why hydrogen peroxide should be in every home Sunday, October 30, 2016 by David Gutierrez, staff writer NaturalNews Inexpensive, nontoxic, versatile and potent Hydrogen peroxide is a wonder product that belongs in every home.Hydrogen peroxide is widely known as a disinfectant for minor cuts and scrapes, but many people dont understand that it works simply by oxidizing microbes to death. Hydrogen peroxide is simply water with an extra oxygen atom attached in this unstable form, the oxygen breaks off from the water and forms a free radical solution that is highly reactive. But once it has reacted, the only byproducts are nonreactive oxygen and water. This is why, when used properly, hydrogen peroxide is so safe.Hydrogen peroxide is so safe and effective that our own immune systems actually generate it as the first line of defense against microbes as diverse as bacteria, viruses, yeast and parasites. In this context, it also appears to act as an antiinflammatory. Natural remedies So how can you make hydrogen peroxide work for you Unsurprisingly, many of this products greatest uses are as natural cures or for some other healthpromoting function. For example, a nasal spray made from one tablespoon of 3 percent hydrogen peroxide in a cup of nonchlorinated water can be an effective treatment for sinus infections. Toothaches caused by minor infection can be treated with a hydrogen peroxide mouthwash the same mouthwash can also remove bad breath.If you think youre coming down with a cold, stave it off by placing a few drops of hydrogen peroxide in your ears each morning.Hydrogen peroxide is also a potent antifungal. A 5050 mix of hydrogen peroxide and water, sprayed on the feet every night and allowed to dry, is a good way to get rid of athletes foot and other fungal infections. A similar but much more diluted cure can be used on plants suffering from fungus in this case, dissolve half a cup of hydrogen peroxide in a gallon of water and spray on the affected plant. Replace your cosmetics You can also get lots of use from hydrogen peroxide around the home. Mixed with baking soda, it makes a great toothpaste. It can also be used to protect water that you expect to be standing for a while, such as that in a humidifier or steamer  a pint of hydrogen peroxide mixed in will prevent microbial growth. Similarly, you can use hydrogen peroxide as a toilet bowl cleaner let it sit for 20 minutes and then scrub.When properly diluted, hydrogen peroxide can detox your skin by stripping away harmful environmental toxins. Just mix 2 quarts of hydrogen peroxide into a full bathtub and soak for half an hour or more.Other cosmetic uses of hydrogen peroxide include cleaning your contact lenses  it denatures proteins that build up on the lenses  or helping to remove ear wax buildup. A few drops in the ears, followed by a few drops of olive oil, will cause earwax to break up and drain out.Hydrogen peroxide can also be used as a safer, gentler alternative to bleach for lightening your hair. Household uses Hydrogen peroxide isnt just for your body it can also be for your dogs Hydrogen peroxide can induce rapid vomiting in dogs that have swallowed dangerous objects. Vomiting should only be induced upon a vets recommendation, however.Finally, hydrogen peroxide can be great for your clothing. Use it instead of bleach to whiten your laundry. More carefully applied, it can take out organic stains by breaking apart the proteins causing the discoloration. This is particularly effective with blood.Use caution when applying hydrogen peroxide directly to clothing, as it may bleach or discolor some fabrics. But if you have a fresh, organic stain, you should be fine if you pour on just a small amount of hydrogen peroxide, wait a few minutes it should foam, and then rinse it off with cold water and soap.

"Did you know that cinnamon can boost intelligence Saturday, October 29, 2016 by Amy Goodrich Tags cinnamon , intelligence , Parkinsons disease NaturalNews Cinnamon is one of the worlds most consumed spices. For thousands of years, it has been prized for its medicinal properties and sweet, warming taste. Aside from sprinkling cinnamon on top of your lattes or adding magic to grandmas apple pie, researchers have found that consuming this tasty household spice also might enhance learning skills.Scientists at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago found that increased ingestion of cinnamon significantly improved the memory of poor learning mice. Recently, their findings were published in the Journal of Neuroimmune Pharmacology in an article entitled Cinnamon Converts Poor Learning Mice to Good Learners Implications for Memory Improvement.The study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Alzheimers Association. How cinnamon affects the brain For the study, lead researcher Kalipada Pahan, a neurology professor at Rush University Medical Center, and his team zoomed in on two key proteins, GABRA5 and CREB, located in the hippocampus region of the brain. The hippocampus is a small part of the brain that generates, organizes, and stores memory. Previous research has shown that lower levels of CREB and higher levels of GABRA5 occur in the brain of poor learners.To see if ground cinnamon could improve the memory of slow learners, the researchers took a group of mice and placed them in a maze with 20 holes. The experiment was focused on watching the mice learn how to locate their target hole.When they tested the mice again after one month of cinnamon feeding, the researchers found that the mice determined to be poor learners had significantly improved their memory and learning skills. They could find their target hole twice as fast.Pahan and his team explained that when cinnamon is ingested the body converts it into sodium benzoate, a chemical compound used to treat brain damage. Furthermore, they discovered that when benzoate entered the mices brains, it increased CREB, decreased GABRA5, and stimulated hippocampal neurons, which led to improved memory and learning skills.We have successfully used cinnamon to reverse biochemical, cellular and anatomical changes that occur in the brains of mice with poor learning, Pahan said.However, no significant improvements were seen in the mice that were considered good learners. But Pahan added that if these results could be replicated in slow learning students, cinnamon could become one of the safest and easiest approaches to convert weaker students to good learners. Cinnamon may halt the progression of Parkinsons disease Pahan and his colleagues previously found that cinnamon had a positive effect on the brains of mice with Parkinsons disease. When cinnamon transforms into sodium benzoate, it works to protect the neurons, normalize brain cells, and improve communication within the brain, which slows down the progression of the disease.Given their promising results, Pahan and his team  supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health  plan on moving forward with testing in human patients with Parkinsons disease.This could potentially be one of the safest approaches to halt disease progression in Parkinsons patients, Pahan said. It would be a remarkable advance in the treatment of this devastating neurodegenerative disease, he added.Before starting to add cinnamon to all your dishes, know that not all cinnamon is created equal. Pahan explained that there are two major types of cinnamon available in the United States  Chinese or cassia cinnamon and Ceylon cinnamon. While both metabolize into sodium benzoate, Ceylon cinnamon is much better than Chinese cinnamon. Chinese cinnamon contains coumarin, a molecule that can damage the liver . Sources",junksci
"Leaked email shows Monsanto Executive V.P. invited to Hillraiser fundraiser to put Clinton into the White House for Monsantos benefit   Monsanto , Hillary Clinton fundraiser , Charles Burson NaturalNews Wikileaks email 28657, part of the John Podesta email leaks, reveals that the Hillary Clinton campaign sought money from a top Monsanto executive to put her into the White House. See the email here .Hillary Clinton, known as the Bride of Frankenfood , is a longtime supporter of Monsanto, a corporation whose deceptive tactics of collusion, intimidation and bullying are a perfect fit for the Clinton regime, which even a former FBI official now describes as a criminal operation .The Monsanto operative invited to the fundraiser was none other than Charles W. Burson, Monsantos former Executive V.P., Secretary and General Counsel. Burson, who retired from Monsanto in 2006 but still maintained an active Monsanto.com email address all the way through 2015, was praised by Monsanto CEO Hugh Grant for pushing the corporations international imperialism agenda to force patented seeds down the throats of poor farmers in developing nations. Its sickening. Via PR Newswire  On behalf of the Monsanto Board of Directors and the employees of Monsanto, I thank Charles for his service to our company, said Hugh Grant, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Monsanto. During his tenure, Monsanto successfully transitioned from an agricultural company fueled by its chemistry business to one led by its seeds and traits businesses. Charles has played an important role in building the companys legal organization to better serve our growing business, not only in the United States but also in Latin America and AsiaPacific, where farmers are increasingly choosing to plant Monsanto seeds and technologies. Clinton fundraiser sought money from one of the most evil corporations in the history of humankind In other words, Charles Burson was instrumental in Monsanto suing farmers whose fields were contaminated by genetically modified Monsanto seeds . This legal action by Monsanto is globally considered to be one of the most evil, antihuman rights abuses of legal power ever witnessed in the modern world, yet the Hillary Clinton campaign saw this man as an opportunity to raise more money to put Hillary Clinton into the White House where, no doubt, she would return the favor to Monsanto through government policy decisions at the USDA and FDA.Fully consistent with the criminal conduct of the Clinton crime mafia, Charles Burson also took part in excusing Monsantos illegal bribery of over 140 Indonesian officials as part of its international agricultural imperialism march against subsistence farmers.After caught committing massive bribery and collusion in Indonesia, Monsantos then general counsel Charles Burson explained that no, Monsanto isnt a bad company. Theyre super honest, and transparent and ethical, tooThe company has taken remedial actions to address the activities in Indonesia. At every stage of this process  beginning with our voluntary disclosure and throughout the governmental investigations and settlement process  Monsanto has been fully cooperative, and has made clear that improper activities will not be tolerated by the company. We are pleased today to begin the process of putting these matters to rest, wrote Burson. Surprise The Justice Department then defers prosecution of Monsanto and forgets these crimes ever happened... Whaddaya know With the corrupt, lawless Justice Department calling the shots, Monsanto was then given a get out of jail free card by the political elite in Washington.From the same link above The Justice Department said it had agreed to defer prosecution on the criminal information for three years, saying it would dismiss it after the period if Monsanto fully complied with the terms of the agreement. So, wait. You mean to tell me that a corporation which got caught bribing 140 foreign officials in Indonesia  a felony crime under U.S. law  was able to get away with it by claiming they will be honest from now on And the Justice Department says oh yes, youre fine now, there will be no prosecution for your serious crimes And then the Clinton fundraiser people specifically reach out to the Monsanto attorney who orchestrated all this and said, Hey, this guy would be awesome to help support a Clinton presidencyYep.Thats Hillary Clinton in a nutshell Hopelessly corrupt... criminally involved... collusion at every level and the total abandonment of human rights and human dignity. This woman shouldnt be behind a desk at the Oval Office... she should be behind bars Oh, and it case youre curious, here are all the other emails that were ccd in that same Hillary Clinton fundraiser message .

"Clinton crime family must be taken down... ARREST THEM ALL Clinton, Podesta, Abedin, Lynch, Mook, Stephanopoulos and all the coconspirators   Clinton corruption , John Podesta , crime family NaturalNews Its not just that the corruption and criminality of the Clintons knows no bounds its also that the democrat political machine trying to thrust her into power also has total disregard for democracy, truth and ethics. Their mission Put our nations worst political criminal into the White House by any means necessary, including systematic lying, fraud, money laundering, intimidation of opponents and even murder of those who might testify against her. The Clinton machine is a mafia operation , and every person involved in it must go to jail.That includes not just the deep operatives like Podesta, Lynch and Abedin, but also all the deep cover Clinton operatives pretending to be journalists , including Stephanopoulos, Maddow, Hayes, Milbank and all the rest  see the list here . Every one of these people has committed crimes of sedition against the United States of America and is guilty of attempting to defraud democracy, steal the election, and place a mafia criminal into power at the highest level of government through the deliberate pursuit of journalistic malpractice . Seditious Clinton operatives must be arrested and put behind bars to protect America We the People are beyond the stage of merely wanting to vote you out of power and turn off your broadcast networks. Its now time to seek your indictment and imprisonment so that you cannot be allowed to harm this society ever again.Every operative, journalist and coconspirator with the Clinton Foundation, the Clinton corruption and the Clinton murders must be arrested, indicted and, if found guilty by a fair trial, sent to prison. This nation needs to heal itself from the Clinton nightmare , and the only way thats going to happen is if the criminal traitors, sellouts and corrupt backstabbers are marched away in handcuffs and put behind bars.A former FBI official said Sunday that Bill and Hillary Clinton are part of a crime family and argued top officials hindered the investigation into Hillary Clintons private email server while she was secretary of State, reports TheHill.com  Kallstrom, best known for leading the investigation into the explosion of TWA flight 800 in the late 90s, said that Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, was a pathological liar.He also blasted Attorney General Loretta Lynch, claiming that she impeded the investigation into Clintons private server.The problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation, he said. Thats the problem. They never had a grand jury empanelled, and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled, Im sure, is Loretta Lynch would not go along with that. God forbid we put someone like that in the White House, he added of Clinton.Kallstrom also said that FBI Director James Comey and the rest of the FBIs leadership were responsible for holding back the investigation, not the rest of the bureau.The agents are furious with whats going on, I know that for a fact, he said. Corrupt, proClinton journalists should not be given any quarter in all this. Much like the propagandists of the Third Reich, they abuse their positions of power to operate in conspiracy with an outright criminal who acts against the interests of the American people. Did you know that Hillary Clinton sold off uranium mining rights to the Russians because the oligarchs who made billions off the deal turned around and donated millions to her Clinton Foundation If you arent aware of this, you need to watch Clinton Cash immediately . The simple truth is that the entire democrat party is a massive criminal cartel What America has now come to realize via the Wikileaks email dumps , the Project Veritas undercover videos and even the revelations of former FBI agents who know whats really happening inside the agency is that the entire democrat party is a massive criminal cartel .From the DNC which actively conspired to sideline Bernie Sanders during the nomination process to the leftwing media which coordinates false smear attacks against Donald Trump, every element of the democrat party is hopelessly corrupt. Democrat political operatives abide by no laws, no ethics and no boundaries. They lie, cheat and steal their way into power at every election... and theyre desperately trying to steal this election, too.Its not just that the Clinton crime family must be taken down, you see Its that the entire democrat establishment should be disbanded or imprisoned . There isnt a highlevel operative inside the DNC who isnt committing election fraud on a daily basis. The coordination and collusion, money laundering and paytoplay influence for sale schemes are all illegal, yet they are the very foundation of the democrat establishment as it exists today.Every one of these people needs to be arrested, indicted and imprisoned. This is the only way genuine democracy can be restored across America. Aside from their criminality, democrats policy ideas just dont work Even on policy alone, democrats are total failures . None of their ideas or policies actually work. Look at Obamacare, with its insurance costs now doubling every 23 years , with coverage options crashing nationwide and the entire failed idea now on the verge of imploding. This was hailed as an historic solution by Obama and the rest of the dummocrats who forced it through Congress and the Supreme Court. In reality, Obamacare was the dumbest idea ever attempted to solve the health care crisis, and I called it that from its inception.Democrats are parasites on society who know nothing other than how to survive as government blood suckers by promising big ideas that routinely fail. They confiscate money from taxpayers, waste it on the most stupid policy ideas ever dreamed up, while siphoning off billions for their own salaries, bonuses and luxurious lifestyles. Then, if you oppose their complete idiocy, they invoke the IRS to have you audited or arrested. This is Amerika today under Obama and the Clintons.This racket must end. The Clintons and all their coconspirators must be sent to prison. Donald Trump is right when he says this is Bigger than Watergate. Theres no comparison. The crimes of the Clintons are a thousand times larger and more damning to democracy than anything Richard Nixon ever attempted. Corrupt leftist media still lying every hour in a desperate attempt to defeat Trump While all this is happening, the corrupt leftist media  Washington Post, New York Times, MSNBC, CNN, Google News, Yahoo News, etc.  has long since abandoned any pretense of engaging in journalism and is now allin for the Clinton criminal mafia.They have thrown their reputations to the wind, betting everything on the most corrupt criminal to ever seek the office of the presidency. Theyre bleeding readers and viewers by the millions as fedup Americans change the channels or turn off their cable TV altogether who needs politicized ESPN, anyway to seek out more accurate news online from sites like Natural News and Breitbart.com .Even the mass censorship of political trends by Facebook and Twitter cant stop the avalanche of awakening now sweeping across America. Across every sector of society, the American people are saying ENOUGH IS ENOUGH We will not allow the criminal democrats to steal this election and install a totalitarian dictator into the White House.We will vote against the establishment in record numbers. We will overwhelm the fraud, outvote the braindead leftists and achieve a landslide victory for Donald Trump.And if the corrupt, criminal democrats still fake the numbers, bribe the electoral voters or commit massive fraud to steal the election, We the People will take to the streets and take our democracy back . We the People will NOT accept a Clinton presidency under these conditions of massive fraud, collusion and extreme media bias Based on everything we are seeing right now, there is no scenario under which Hillary Clinton will be accepted as the legitimate victor of this election. In no way has this been an open, fair and free election. It has been a warped, onesided exercise in media collusion that isnt fooling anyone.In the minds of the real American people, Hillary Clinton is done for . The People will not stand for more corruption, collusion and criminals running our system. The revolt has begun , and it will sweep through the voting booths, the electorate and if necessary, the very streets of America to demand an end to the failed, corrupt political establishment run by sinister criminals who belong behind bars.Get ready, my friends, to take this country back. First, vote for Donald Trump as a vote against corruption and collusion of the leftist establishment.Secondly, demand the arrest of all Clintonlinked operatives , including those in the leftist lying media.Thirdly, do not tolerate the theft of your democracy by corrupt Clinton operatives who are trying to steal this election. If they steal the votes or steal the Electoral College outcome, prepare to march in the streets to take your country back .Yes, Im calling for peaceful mass protests, everywhere across America, if the criminal democrats and corrupt leftist media steal this election through fraud. Bring plenty of rope because you may have to swing across moats and scale the walls of the castle to finally reach the inner layers of corruption and criminality in Washington D.C. Thats a metaphor, for the dumbasdirt leftwing media journalists who are too stupid to parse a sentence. DEFEAT Clinton now or lose America to a totalitarian regime that will never let go of absolute power This is your LAST CHANCE to take America back. If you allow the Clintons and the corrupt democrats to seize power through widespread fraud and theft, there will never be an open, fair and free election in America ever again . All opponents of Clinton will be imprisoned or executed. All conservative media outlets will be taken offline or silenced. The borders will be opened to a massive wave of illegal aliens from all across the world, and they will overrun and occupy America, destroying it from within while the bigoted, intolerant democrats turn the entire nation into a sanctuary nation where illegals have absolute immunity while patriots are executed or imprisoned by the millions.Thats the American Holocaust youre going to be witnessing if you allow these criminals  Clinton, Abedin, Podesta, Stephanopoulos and all the rest  to remain in power. Throw them behind bars if you want to see your country survive the next four years .",junksci
"SCANDAL EPA could have issued an emergency order 7 months before Flint water crisis became public knowledge Monday, October 31, 2016 by J. D. Heyes Tags Flint , water crisis , EPA coverup NaturalNews The federal bureaucracy and corresponding state agencies have never been much good at responding to crises in a timely fashion, and that tradition was alive and well during the recent toxic water crisis in Flint, Michigan.In fact, according to a newly released watchdog report, Americans now know that the federal Environmental Protection Agency EPA could have intervened in the crisis a full seven months before it finally did, meaning thousands of residents in Flint would have had to drink far less water tainted with lead.As reported by The Associated Press , the EPAs inspector general said that the agency had the authority and enough information to issue emergency orders to protect Flint residents from the leadcontaminated water they were drinking as early as June 2015, seven months before officials finally declared an emergency.Inspector General Arthur Elkins said in an interim report that the water crisis should have created a greater sense of urgency for the EPA to intervene when the safety of drinking water is compromised. Everyone is pointing fingers at everyone else The drinking water in Flint became tainted with unsafe levels of lead after city officials decided to begin drawing from the Flint River in April 2014, in a bid to save money. The broke city of about 100,000 residents north of Detroit was under state control at the time.Regulators did not make sure that the water was properly treated, so lead from aging pipes leached into the supply, the AP reported.Since the discovery of high levels of lead, federal, state and local officials have traded accusations about who is most to blame for the crisis , even as residents are still forced to drink bottled or filtered water.Doctors have detected higher than normal levels of lead in hundreds of children around the city. And many taps remain offlimits.Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, appointed a panel to look into the matter. It concluded that the state is fundamentally accountable for the lead crisis due to decisions made by state environmental regulators as well as stateappointed emergency managers who were in charge of running the city.But that said, once the EPA discovered that water being consumed by city residents was tainted with unsafe levels of lead, Snyder believes the agency should have acted  and he is right.As Gov. Snyder has stated all along, what happened in Flint was the result of failure of government at all levels, his spokeswoman, Anna Heaton, said recently.Since the crisis began, officials have tried to reshuffle the deck, so to speak, and call it reform. They say some state agencies have undergone culture changes that will supposedly prevent future recurrences of epic failure, according to Heaton, who called such changes encouraging. People should be held accountable  but wont be Its unclear how many people actually believe that, considering that state agencies had mandates already to protect the public from polluted and contaminated water as did the EPA. By culture changes, does Heaton mean that people were fired and actually replaced by others who will do what taxpayers are paying them to doFlint Mayor Karen Weaver, a Democrat who took office after the crisis emerged, said agencies like the EPA and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality are there to help ensure the wellbeing and safety of men, women and children, yet they failed in their core mission to do so. She also called for those who are responsible for the crisis to be held accountable, though we advise her not to hold her breath.As for the EPAs inspector general report, it said that the agencys Midwest region did not issue an emergency order because officials concluded actions taken by the state prevented the EPA from doing so. The report says that their interpretation was not correct, and that according to federal law, when state actions are deemed to be unacceptable, the EPA can and should proceed with an emergency order designed to protect the public in a timely manner.Without EPA intervention, the conditions in Flint persisted, and the state continued to delay taking action to require corrosion control or provide alternative drinking water supplies, the report said.

"MUTINY AT THE FBI Comey warned by his own agents to indict Clinton or watch the FBIs reputation go down in flames Monday, October 31, 2016 Tags James Comey , FBI mutiny , Clinton investigation NaturalNews As America inches toward open revolt over the runaway criminality and collusion of the democrats and the media , another kind of revolt is taking place inside the FBI. According to multiple sources in the independent media  now the only remaining free press in America  FBI director James Comey was forced into announcing a reopening of the criminal investigation into Hillary Clintons private email server by livid FBI agents who threatened to go public if Comey didnt act.James Comey, long since suspected to be a Clinton operative who deliberately allowed Hillary Clinton to get away with a vast number of felony crimes and national security violations, now finds himself with his back against the wall. If he releases the evidence against Hillary Clinton already possessed by the FBI, he will face the wrath of Obama, the Clintons, the corrupt Loretta Lynch DOJ and the entire leftist media. If he once again gives Hillary Clinton a free pass on her numerous crimes, he then faces a mutiny inside the FBI which promises to bypass his authority and leak the criminal evidence directly to the alternative media. FBI agents under Comey are desperately trying to save their agency from going down in flames Agents inside the FBI, in other words, refuse to allow James Comey to let the agency go down in flames as just another corrupt branch of the Clinton crime family. Via the Daily Mail UK  James Comeys decision to revive the investigation of Hillary Clintons email server and her handling of classified material came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the FBI , including some of his top deputies, according to a source close to the embattled FBI director. This dovetails with my own sources who tell me that the recent acquittal of the Oregon ranchers has also driven a stake through James Comeys reputation, as he is the FBI official who reportedly ordered the execution of Robert LaVoy Finicum, whose suspected execution by FBI agents was caught on tape .Because the Oregon ranchers have now been acquitted by a jury, it means FBI head James Comey seems to have ordered the shooting and killing of an innocent man .Under Comey  and to the dismay of the many great agents working inside the FBI  Comey may have turned the agency toward a lawless armed tyranny that guns down innocent Americans while letting corrupt criminal politicians go free. For many FBI agents who have spent their entire careers serving the FBI as honest, dedicated federal agents, the thought of allowing James Comey to singlehandedly commit political arson and burn down the FBIs hardwon reputation is just too much to bear.Resignations are beginning to pile up on Comeys desk as livid FBI agents head for the exits...Via the Daily Mail The atmosphere at the FBI has been toxic ever since Jim announced last July that he wouldnt recommend an indictment against Hillary, said the source, a close friend who has known Comey for nearly two decades... Comey told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. The letters reminded him every day that morale in the FBI had hit rock bottom. And while the decision to reopen the case may appease FBI agents and republicans, in the shortterm, we suspect it does very little to restore overall faith in his competence. As such, we continue to question just how long Comey can hold out before being forced to resign his post, adds Zero Hedge . At a bare minimum, in light of his continued questionable judgement and serious doubts raised about the integrity of the first investigation, we fail to understand how an independent investigation into Hillarys email server isnt warranted. James Comey is an arsonist, and hes going to burn the FBI to the ground unless his agents mutiny The upshot of all this is that James Comey is an arsonist. If his own agents dont force him to apply the law to the Clinton investigations, Comey will burn the agency to the ground, leaving its reputation in ashes. And that, sadly, will make the world a very dangerous place for all the FBI agents in the field, because everyday Americans would begin to see them all as corrupt, lawless tyrants working as part of a criminal regime in Washington that refuses to apply laws to its own kind.The truth is that most FBI agents are hard working, professional men and women who are desperately trying to shut down the operations of terrorists, financial fraudsters, kidnappers, murderers and other dangerous criminals. Yet if James Comey doesnt defend the FBIs reputation by indicting Hillary Clinton , he will likely be placing FBI field agents in grave danger as they face the wrath of citizens who begin to see them all as part of a corrupt criminal tyranny run by the political mafia in D.C.Comey, in other words, is more dangerous to the entire FBI than any other single person in Washington right now. If he doesnt find his moral compass and guide the FBI through this crisis with law and order intact, hes going to go down in history and in flames as the man who forever destroyed the credibility of the FBI and likely turned his field agents into ready targets for an enraged populace.No doubt, hell get an extra bonus from Loretta Lynch if he once again decides to nullify the rule of law in America and announce that Hillary wont be subject to the same laws that would immediately ensnare anyone else. Remember If Comey gives Hillary Clinton a free pass, he demonstrates to all Americans that lawlessness is now the accepted standard of conduct in Washington . And if our political leaders will not be held to account for their crimes, then practically speaking, why should any citizen feel compelled to follow any federal laws at all James Comey If you want to salvage the FBIs reputation, announce a recommendation for the indictment of both Hillary Clinton and Loretta Lynch If theres one thing abundantly clear in all this, its that both Hillary Clinton and Loretta Lynch should be behind bars . Clinton is a lifelong criminal and mafia boss. Lynch is a thirdrate attorney who was tossed into the DOJ solely because of her gender and skin color, not her credentials. And neither one respects the laws of America, of course. Both are deeply corrupt.If the FBI hopes to have any reputation remaining after the Hillary Clinton campaign implodes either before or on November 8th, Comey needs to come out strong right now and lay out the evidence that unambiguously shows Hillary Clinton had CLEAR INTENT to violate national security laws , among other serious crimes.All Comey would have to say is something like, In the view of the FBI, Hillary Clinton is clearly not qualified to serve as Commander in Chief, and we recommend she be indicted for violations of national security... and so on. With a single sentence, Comey could reinvigorate the FBI and position himself as an historic American hero.Right now, Id imagine the Clinton machine is mailing bloody body parts in tiny wooden coffins to James Comeys home address, along with notes that say something like, Youre next. Lets watch and see if he grows a spine and refuses to be intimidated.",junksci
"Dilbert creator Scott Adams endorses Trump, says Hillary is a bully Monday, October 31, 2016 by Natural News Editors NaturalNews Ive been trying to figure out what common trait binds Clinton supporters together. As far as I can tell, the most unifying characteristic is a willingness to bully in all its forms.If you have a Trump sign in your lawn, they will steal it.If you have a Trump bumper sticker, they will deface your car.if you speak of Trump at work you could get fired.Article republished from Dilbert.com On social media, almost every message I get from a Clinton supporter is a bullying type of message. They insult. They try to shame. They label. And obviously they threaten my livelihood.We know from Project Veritas that Clinton supporters tried to incite violence at Trump rallies. The media downplays it.We also know Clintons side hired paid trolls to bully online. You dont hear much about that.Yesterday, by no coincidence, Huffington Post, Salon, and Daily Kos all published similarsounding hit pieces on me, presumably to lower my influence. That reason, plus jealousy, are the only reasons writers write about other writers.Joe Biden said he wanted to take Trump behind the bleachers and beat him up. No one on Clintons side disavowed that call to violence because, I assume, they consider it justified hyperbole.Team Clinton has succeeded in perpetuating one of the greatest evils I have seen in my lifetime. Her side has branded Trump supporters 40 of voters as Nazis, sexists, homophobes, racists, and a few other fighting words. Their argument is built on confirmation bias and persuasion. But facts dont matter because facts never matter in politics. What matters is that Clintons framing of Trump provides moral cover for any bullying behavior online or in person. No one can be a bad person for opposing Hitler, rightSome Trump supporters online have suggested that people who intend to vote for Trump should wear their Trump hats on election day. That is a dangerous idea, and I strongly discourage it. There would be riots in the streets because we already know the bullies would attack. But on election day, inviting those attacks is an extradangerous idea. Violence is bad on any day, but on election day, Republicans are far more likely to unholster in an effort to protect their voting rights. Things will get wet fast.Yes, yes, I realize Trump supporters say bad things about Clinton supporters too. I dont defend the bad apples on either side. Ill just point out that Trumps message is about uniting all Americans under one flag. The Clinton message is that some Americans are good people and the other 40 are some form of deplorables, deserving of shame, vandalism, punishing taxation, and violence. She has literally turned Americans on each other. It is hard for me to imagine a worse thing for a presidential candidate to do.Ill say that again.As far as I can tell, the worst thing a presidential candidate can do is turn Americans against each other. Clinton is doing that, intentionally. Intentionally. As I often say, I dont know who has the best policies. I dont know the best way to fight ISIS and I dont know how to fix healthcare or trade deals. I dont know which tax policies are best to lift the economy. I dont know the best way to handle any of that stuff. And neither do you. But I do have a bad reaction to bullies. And Ive reached my limit.I hope you have too. Therefore... I endorse Donald Trump for President of the United States because I oppose bullying in all its forms. I dont defend Trumps personal life. Neither Trump nor Clinton are role models for our children. Lets call that a tie, at worst.The bullies are welcome to drown in their own bile while those of us who want a better world do what weve been doing for hundreds of years Work to make it better while others complain about how were doing it.Today I put Trumps odds of winning in a landslide back to 98. Remember, I told you a few weeks ago that Trump couldnt win unless something changed.Something just changed.",junksci
"Keywords cavities , coconut oil , Dental health , gingivitis , Oil Pulling , Teeth We all know about the popular and ancient practice of oil pulling, but many of us dont understand how this practice works or how exactly it benefits our teeth Oil pulling began in Ayurvedic medicine thousands of years ago and has achieved widespread popularity in modern society today.

"Posted Monday, October 31, 2016 at 1242pm EDT Low cholesterol and its consequence Previously, we have seen that cholesterol is a critical element of our cells and tissues 1. In addition, scientific evidence suggests that high cholesterol is not necessarily harmful, but offers a protective effect against brain disorders such as Alzheimers disease 2. At this point, we should ask the opposite question what about if we have too little cholesterol What are the consequences Without cholesterol, we would die It is well known today that cholesterol performs several important functions in the body. One of the best important is not the most important function of cholesterol is to assist the proper regulation of the immune system. Indeed, people who have a low blood cholesterol have an anergic immune system, i.e. a lack of reaction by the bodys defense mechanisms to foreign substances Vredevoe et al. 1998. In other words, your body cannot fight off pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. Without cholesterol, the different cells involved in an immune response such as macrophages, lymphocytes, etc. cannot recognize the invaders and destroy them. Interestingly, it was shown that the LDL particles are the ones needed for an adequate immune response Masterjohn 2007. These particles neutralize microbes and toxins before they cause any damage to the tissues/organs. And we call these LDL particles bad cholesterol Without them, we would be dead Another fact is that a low blood cholesterol increases our risks of developing tuberculosis. More importantly, a sufficient supply of cholesterol to the immune system is critical to eliminate cancer cells. Indeed, cholesterol is needed to slow down the progression of cancer. In addition to cholesterol, saturated fats, like palmitic and myristic acids, are also necessary for an optimum immune system. These fats are found in tropical oil such as coconut oil. Would this fact explain why Asian people have a lower rate of cancer than North Americans Is cholesterol protective not causative of heart disease There is a tremendous amount of evidence to suggest that microbial infections are one of the primary drive force of plaque accumulation in the arteries of the heart 5, 6. In support of this, a lack of buccal hygiene considerably increases your risk of heart disease 7. Some researchers have noticed that people who suffered from a heart attack also had the flu a few days prior 8, 9. It seems that those microorganisms change the structure of the blood vessels leading to inflammation and an accumulation of plaques at the sites of injury. Based on this evidence, we can propose that cholesterol actually minimizes the risk of developing heart disease via the elimination of dangerous pathogens. Indeed, it seems to be the case 10. It is time to end this war on cholesterol. Science is very clear cholesterol does not cause heart disease. On the contrary, cholesterol is a vital element of a vibrant health by making sure the immune system is strong, by being a critical component of vitamin D synthesis, by helping the body make sex hormones, among other functions.",junksci

"Keywords Better Tasting Food , GMOs , homestead , Homesteading If you clicked a link that got you to this page, you cant pretend that you are not interested in homesteading any longer. Im not sure if you are afraid of the effort, afraid that you wont know what to do, or what you are afraid of, but its time to get up and get going. I have been homesteading for over 15 years and wouldnt change it for anything in the world. My husband and I have made many mistakes along the way, but we have never been afraid to put in the hard work to get any job done. For all our hard work, we have become one of the rare profitable homesteads that are more than just surviving. We all have our own reasons that we want to try homesteading, so dont base yours off of mine. I am just hoping to spark some interest to get you off your feet so you can make your dream become a reality. I Provide Healthy Food For My Family We are not vegan, vegetarian, of allergic to gluten, but we are completely aware of what we are putting into our bodies. I just dont like to buy vegetables from the grocery store that have been produced chemically. I also dont like to buy meat that was fed all sorts of things that I dont know about. Everything that I put on my kitchen table, to feed my family, has been grown or produced by me or someone I know. I know that the corn we ate last night was grown using some organic soil, water, and a little alpaca poop for good measure. The pork also came from our farm, and I know about everything that pig ate in his very happy two years of life. Im not saying that we are the healthiest family in the world, but I know we arent eating chemicals . That is what matters to me and my husband The Food Tastes So Much Better The food that we produce on our homestead is so much better that the food you are purchasing at the grocery store. The truth is that they are looking to produce as much perfect looking food as they can, as fast as they can. They dont want to grow the strands of produce that take a little longer but taste exponentially better. The meat also takes better because you arent rushing that either. Not to mention the fact that you are feeding the animals with healthier and better tasting food. When you slaughter the food yourself, it will taste better as well. Animals that are stressed when they get slaughtered produce meat that is much tougher that meat that we produce here on the homestead. Freedom Not many people can say that they have complete freedom to do what they please during the day. Now, that doesnt mean that we dont have responsibilities, but we can take an hour off in the middle of the day to attend the elementary school winter concert. We can also take those doctor appointments in the middle of the day when the office isnt insane. If you want to get freedom over your own life, start homesteading today  We Have Economic Security If the economy crashes, we are not in risk of going without anything that we really need. We dont rely on anyone for any of the basic necessities, including a source of income. We have everything that we need in order to survive right here on the homestead. There isnt much that can go wrong with the government that could put us at risk. I am not an apocalypse prepper, but I will say that homesteaders are more prepared should a disaster occur. We have more knowledge and experience in all of the tasks needed in an extreme survival situation than most people I know. Our Kids Understand The Meaning of Hard Work Im not saying that your kids dont understand the meaning of hard work, but my kids have been there and done that. My nine year old wakes up two hours before school and takes care of the chickens every day. Those chickens are completely her responsibility and she know that. I do allow my kids to use electronics during down time, they just know the difference between down time and chore time. They feel like they are part of the team, so it doesnt feel like we are making them do chores every day. You might also like",junksci
"Keywords complimentary medicine , holistic health , homeopathy , nhs The Department for Health is currently reviewing whether or not homeopathy in the NHS should continue to be available through doctor referrals. Against a backdrop of funding cuts and increasing pressure to reduce costs, the Government and health managers are looking at whether to add homeopathy to the NHSs schedule 1 blacklist, a selection of products that NHS doctors are banned from prescribing. However despite consistent claims that there is a lack of quality evidence into the positive health benefits of homeopathy, the NHS has spent more than 1.75m on homeopathic treatments over the last 10 years, and any proposed ban is likely to have its fair share of detractors. Almost six million Brits seek the help complementary and alternative medicine of which homeopathy is a part with one in four wanting access to be universally available through the NHS. The lead argument for the exclusion of homeopathic treatment is lack of evidence that supports its effectiveness, with research often being labeled as inconclusive. However proponents for the inclusion of homeopathy argue that this doesnt necessarily mean that there is no evidence. Dr Helen Beaumont, a GP and the president of the Faculty of Homeopathy, has recently stated that homeopathic treatment has a profound effect on patients. Its disappointing that at a time when the NHS is facing a funding crisis the Department of Health is embarking on a costly consultation that could prevent highly skilled clinicians prescribing a course of treatment that benefits thousands of patients each year. If the department were serious about saving money surely it should be looking at SSRIs Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors prescribed for mild to moderate depression in vast quantities at considerable cost to the NHS, but which studies have found to be ineffective for those conditions. George Freeman, the minister for life sciences, has stated that in a time of rising demand, the government has a duty to ensure NHS funds are spent only on the most effective treatments. However an article in the British Medical Journal BMJ that examined the scientific evidence behind NHS treatments, found that 46 of 2,500 commonly used NHS treatments are of unknown effectiveness, and only 13 are known to be beneficial. The argument is being made that the principals being applied to homeopathy, are consistent for all forms of treatments throughout the NHS. Collating research itself has also proved to be difficult, with the positive effects of homeopathy often a challenge to fully quantify. The NHS is driven by targets and trial evidence using hard data like death and disease to determine the effectiveness of a particular treatment. Researching and recording a patients quality of life, happiness and emotional satisfaction has always been much more difficult to quantify, but a wealth of anecdotal evidence and studies from other European countries continue to support the use of homeopathic treatment. For example, in 2008, over a hundred homeopathic GP practices in Germany and Switzerland took up the challenge 1 of demonstrating the health of chronically ill patients after eight years of homeopathic treatment. It concluded that homeopathy is clinically effective, costeffective and safe  with the results playing an important role in the inclusion of homeopathy as part of their national healthcare scheme. Similarly the largest study at Bristol Homeopathic Hospital 2 followed the effectiveness of homeopathy on 6,500 consecutive patients over a sixyear period. 70 of followup patients reported improved health with 50 reporting major improvement. The debate whether homeopathy in the NHS will no doubt continue. The homeopathic profession has had to face increasing criticism and hostility over recent years, but with an average annual spend of 152,000 on homeopathic treatment the equivalent of 0.0013 of the total NHS drug budget it should be remembered that if these patients were not treated with homeopathic medicines, they would have to be treated by other NHS departments with potentially more expensive, conventional drugs. 1  BMC Public Health BMC Series, 2008, 8 413 doi 10.1186/147124588413 2 http//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16296912 This post was written by The Elysian Centre, a multidisciplinary practice for holistic healing and homeopathy in Rye, East Sussex.",junksci

"Keywords Acupuncture , baby eczema , cure baby eczema , eczema cure , eczema treatment , heal eczema There was a time when my sons eczema became so severe I was willing to try any natural healing method. My baby was 5 months old when he developed eczema. We tried the usual dose of steroids and overthecounter creams from our family doctor. It got so bad that his scars were not healing. He wasnt sleeping. And I wasnt sleeping. As a child, my mother took me to an Acupuncturist for migraines. And the migraines stopped after a handful of visits. I remember it being a pretty relaxing experience with the smell of incense and herbs and the quietness of the room. So, I took a leap of faith and booked us for an appointment with a Traditional Chinese Doctor who specialized in skin disorders, allergies, and asthma. Why Try Acupuncture  Traditional Chinese Medicine Reason 1 Acupuncture has been practiced for almost 4000 years in China. With that much history, its worth a try. It is a method of relieving pain or curing an illness by placing needles in the patients body at precise points along the 12 meridians in the body. Meridians are energy pathways that are associated with different organs within the body. The World Health Organization lists 300 ailments that are treatable by Chinese Medicine  Acupuncture. Reason 2 Acupuncture has helped children with eczema In a study of 37 children who were treated with Chinese Medicinal herbs, the treatment reduced eczema symptoms by 90 in 18 of the children see Sources. Although it was a small study size, the benefits seem to far outweigh the risks. When my son was a baby, even a 10 improvement in his symptoms would have been amazing for us. Reason 3 Acupuncture does not hurt babies Many people worry about the needles hurting. But the needles that Acupuncturists use are about 1/100 th of a syringe needle. My son was a baby when we started the treatments, and he never cried out when getting the needles in him. Reason 4 Acupuncture relieved my babys eczema by 80 Acupuncture healed the eczema to the point where we could figure out his triggers. Our doctor stabilized the eczema. Best of all, flareups only occurred when my baby was teething. His skin was softer than it had been in months. Acupuncture needs to be done on babies for a minimum of 3 months in order to see an improvement. This is because the treatment is trying to alter the immune response, which is a long process. But sometimes babies will respond quicker than that. We used a topical herb powder given to us by the doctor, and applied it to his skin. This topical mix had a similar effect as hydrocortisone cream if I applied it 35 times per day with a cotton ball. Reason 5 Acupuncture is affordable This is true especially if you go to a student clinic. You can pay the affordable price and yet the students are supervised by very experienced doctors. For child and baby treatments, it is even more affordable. It cost us about 1530 per visit on average we tried a few different clinics. Some health plans will cover Acupuncture, so check with your health plan to see if yours covers it. To keep it affordable, I suggest trying to find a specialist in Acupuncture  TCM Traditional Chinese Medicine, not a practitioner who does many different types of treatments. Tips for Helping Your Child While Getting Acupuncture Bring a favorite stuffed animal, a book, or some toys. Try nursing your baby while they are receiving acupuncture. A baby only needs the needle in the acupressure point for a second and then they are pulled out. Adults typically have needles in for 45 minutes for each treatment, because our bodies do not respond as quickly as babies bodies do. Check out my YouTube video for more tips Find an Experienced  Accredited Acupuncturist Make sure to look for an Accredited Acupuncturist or TCM Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctor. Be sure the Acupuncturist has some experience in your condition. Chat with the people in the waiting room. And see if theyve had success with your doctor. I met a few moms in the waiting room that swore by the Chinese Doctor we were going to see. That made me feel more comfortable. Find a TCM Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctor who offers Certified Organic Chinese herbs. Certified Organic means the herbs were never sprayed with toxic pesticides and herbicides.

"Keywords Election 2016 , rigged election , Voting , voting errors , voting machines malfunction Voting Machines Malfunction This is just a straight up fact, especially since many of our voting machines are so antiquated. As you vote this year you should watch out for these glitches. Sometimes the votes appear to be flipped as in a voter intends to vote for Candidate A, but Candidate Bs name is selected on the screen. When this happens it is known as vote flipping, and is supposed to only happen rarely. With millions of votes cast, there have supposedly only been a few hundred reports of vote flipping every year for the past decade. These are the ones reported so you do wonder whether this happens unnoticed much more often. Im just saying Im seeing reports of this specifically happening all around the country so cast your vote and double check. Check your ballot after you cast your vote and if it happens to you call on a poll worker to help get it fixed. Remember Voting Machine malfunctions do happen. There are reports of this happening already in North Carolina, Texas and Nevada with machines vote flipping in the last couple weeks. You have to remember that the majority of the machines in use today predate the iPhone or the iPad, and most of them use technology from the late 90s, Lawrence Norden, a voting technology expert at the Brennan Center for Justice in New York, told TIME. As these machines age, you start to have hardware issues. One problem that also occurs on older machines is the glue that attaches the screen to the machine breaks down and you can get alignment issues as well. Poll workers and technicians need to reset the machines regularly to ensure the buttons are lined up right. In other cases, it can just be a user error because no one uses the type of equipment used at the voting centers on a regular basis. In Texas voters reported attempting to vote a straight Republican ticket, but found the Clinton/Kaine ticket selected instead. This can be found specifically in voting districts where they use the old, rotarystyle voting machine. If you select one candidate and the other appears on the screen or if youre looking at the summary screen and it just isnt right voters should notify the poll workers. They can cancel out your session so you can do it over. Poll from PressTV.com 10/28/2016",junksci
"Keywords digestive enzymes , heal hemorrhoids fast , hemorrhoid recipe , liver and hemorrhoids , natural remedies for hemorrhoids Heal Hemorrhoids Fast You are not alone. There are more than 3 million reported cases per year in the USA alone Hemorrhoids are often caused from straining during bowel movements, obesity and are especially prevalent in pregnancy. Mild to excruciating discomfort is the number one symptom, especially during bowel movements or when sitting. Other very unpleasant symptoms include itching and bleeding. The older you get the more likely you are to experience them. They are very rare in the under 13 year age bracket, common between 1418 and become very common for the over 18 crowd. Hemorrhoids Related to Digestive Problems Hemorrhoids are often a sign of inefficient digestion, decreased liver function and/or not having enough digestive enzymes to properly digest your food. It can also indicate inflammation in the small intestines. Hemorrhoids occur when the bowel and liver are stagnate. Symptoms become apparent due to swollen and inflamed veins around the anus and rectum sorry. This can be caused by chronic constipation, straining and putting pressure on the lower bowel During digestion we produce enzymes in our mouth and stomach which break down the foods and help to absorb nutrients. When enzymes are not sufficient to break foods down, it sits in the stomach and ferments. This leads to gas, bloating and fermentation. Liver Health is Crucial to Prevention The liver is most active between 13 am when it is processing wastes, cleansing, eliminating lymphatic drainage and regenerating. If the liver is not working optimally due to health issues, allergies, drug side effects or poor eating habits then it may be overtaxed. Often people will wake up during the time the liver is most active 13am and feel thirsty and hot because the liver is working over time. So this can be why you get up nightly to get a drink of water. How to Heal Hemorrhoids Fast Step 1 Optimize liver and kidney function Consider taking an all natural electrolyte powder supplement which can be added to water. These powders are available in health food stores and contain the basic electrolytes Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium and Calcium. Make sure they dont contain artificial colors or other unhealthy additives. Increase your fluid intake throughout the day especially if you exercise and lose hydration through sweat. Eating Right for Prevention Eat 5 smaller meals a day rather than 3 large ones. Limit sugar, salt, tea, coffee, alcohol and soda In the morning drink a 60z glass of warm water with 1 teaspoon Apple Cider Vinegar, 1/2 tsp honey and either fresh lemon juice or 2 drops of high quality lemon essential oil. Lemon increases digestive juices, cleanses the bowels and helps the liver to detoxify. Lemon also has the ability to clean out the diverticuli pockets in the bowels and reduce stagnation. Hydrate well to preventing drying out the bowels which can cause constipation. Eat greens such as radicchio and endive to promote digestion. Drink Peppermint, Dandelion, Burdock or Chamomile herbal teas. Add healthy oils into your diet including avocados, fish oil , virgin olive oil, flaxseed oil, nuts and seeds. These are all good lubricants allowing stools to pass more easily. Add vegetables, fruits and other healthy fibrous foods. Avoid drinking liquids 20 minutes before or after eating to avoid diluting digestive enzymes. Cut down on wheat, dairy, processed and refined foods as well as excessively spicy foods. Additional Preventative Measures Consider doing a gentle liver detoxification and overall cleanse every 6 months to promote better digestion and keep your bowels moving properly. Probiotics can help the digestive tract balance of good flora as bloating is often contributed to fermentation, constipation and inflammation which lead to hemorrhoids and bowel issues. Taking Slippery elm supplements before meals can be helpful. As well as taking Vitamin C, bioflavinoids Rutin and Magnesium supplements may reduce hemorrhoids and cleanse the bowel. Heal Hemorrhoids Fast Recipe Add 5 drops each of Lavender and Tea Tree Melaleuca Essential oil 3 Tbs of fractionated or melted virgin coconut oil Place these in a small glass container like a 4 oz mason jar.

"Taking Care of Your Eye Health the Natural Way Ad 72890  HBS Account  2149237058061490 http//blogs.naturalnews.com/takingcareeyehealthnaturalway/ By Jade Rich Posted Monday, October 31, 2016 at 1209pm EDT Keywords best foods for eye health , betacarotene , Cataracts , eye health , foods that contain antioxidants , Free Radicals , lutein , macular degeneration , maintaining healthy eyes , mesozeaxanthin , natural vision training , naturally occurring antioxidants , ocular migraines , optic nerve damage , protect your eyes , vitamin C , Vitamin E , zeaxanthin When most people think about their eye health , the first thing that comes to mind is whether or not they need to wear glasses. Although your vision is a major part of your overall eye health, there are actually many more things that you need to be concerned about. For example, there are a staggering 56 common disorders that can plague your eyes. These issues range from cataracts to ocular migraines. Fortunately, there are many natural methods you can utilize to help keep your eyes healthy. Nutrients Your Eyes Need There are three nutrients that are known to be critical for maintaining healthy eyes Lutein, zeaxanthin and mesozeaxanthin. Each of these nutrients serves as an antioxidant that helps protect your eyes from the damaging effects of free radicals. As Natural News has pointed out before, free radicals are the main basis of all injuries, illnesses and deaths. Antioxidants are the only way to fight free radicals, so its a good thing that these three nutrients are found naturally in the human eye. But what happens when something interrupts this process Sadly, you can end up with a long list of eye health problems that may even lead to blindness. Instead of merely sitting back and allowing this to happen, you can be proactive and start taking supplements. The good news is that lutein and zeaxanthin supplements are easy to find. Research has discovered that most of these supplements also contain mesozeaxanthin, although this isnt usually disclosed on the label. In fact, it sounds likely that this recently discovered eye nutrient is a natural byproduct of lutein and zeaxanthin. Of course, this doesnt absolve the supplement companies of their duty to report whether or not mesozeaxanthin is present in their products. However, their negligence also doesnt reduce the natural reliance that your eyes have on all three of these nutrients. In addition to stocking up on these supplements, it is also wise to increase your intake of other naturally occurring antioxidants, including Vitamin E, Vitamin C and beta carotene. Food Sources There are many foods that contain antioxidants . Carrots are perhaps the most wellknown resource for eye health because they are so rich in beta carotene. It would be a mistake to think of carrots as the prime resource, though. You can also turn to oranges, tomatoes, sweet potatoes and dark berries for a mixture of necessary vitamins. These are some of the best foods for eye health. Even better, you can derive lutein and zeaxanthin directly from food sources such as eggs, pistachios, corn, peppers and kale. With enough of these food items in your diet, you can avoid the cost of supplements while still keeping your eyes extremely healthy. Additional Eye Health Tips If you are a smoker who is also concerned about eye health, now is a good time to carefully consider quitting. Unfortunately, people who smoke have an increased risk of developing macular degeneration, optic nerve damage and cataracts. If you begin abstaining from tobacco products now, though, your odds of ending up with one of these eye health complications will begin to decline. Other easy steps you can take to protect your eyes include always wearing sunglasses during sunny days and steering clear of computer screens as much as possible. If you use a computer for work, take a 20 second vision break every 20 minutes. Ultimately, combining the proper nutrients with easy tips such as wearing sunglasses will help keep your eyes healthy throughout your life. If youre currently dealing with issues such as light sensitivity and vision loss, you may also be able to naturally regain control of your eye health by using natural vision training and other eye exercises. This is definitely a better option than undergoing a surgery that has an extensive list of serious risks and usually leaves patients still needing eyeglasses. As usual, the natural way is better About the author Jade Rich is an LPN and Director at an Inpatient Rehabilitation Center. As a mother of three children, she is always looking for natural ways to keep her kids eyes healthy. She knows from experience that another way to do this is by scheduling them for routine eye exams. This helps with early detection and prevention. Its best to schedule this during the backtoschool season. During the visit, their pediatrician examines their eye alignment and gives a test for visual acuity. Sources",junksci
"Chinese political dissidents are having their organs cut from their bodies for transplant tourists Tuesday, November 01, 2016 by J. D. Heyes Tags China , organ harvesting , political prisoners NaturalNews In the U.S. these days, supporting GOP presidential nominee Donald J. Trump will earn you an assault from Leftwing cowards and bullies who support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton . But in China, being a political dissident and opposing the ruling Communist government could earn you a trip to a hospital operating room.Where youll have your organs removed for waiting transplant tourists.As reported by the Epoch Times , Chinese officials began persecuting the 100 million practitioners of Falun Gong in July 1999, and have continued to do so ever since. To the Chinese communists, there is no such thing as a religious deity or belief, because communists insist that their form of government should be the only thing requiring loyalty and faithfulness.Not long ago this kind of treatment of Chinese dissidents would draw loud rebukes from the U.S. government, the United Nations and various human rights organizations around the world, as well as major media coverage. But since the Chinese manufacturing economy has become such an integral part of the economies of most of the worlds advanced countries, outrage has been muted.The lack of outrage and subsequent media coverage and pressure by governments has essentially given the Chinese communists a green light to treat Falun Gong  and anyone else deemed a political dissident  in any barbaric way they choose. A new form of evil Hence, the creation of a cottage industry of sorts  Transplant Tourism. As the Epoch Times noted, this is essentially  murder on demand  for an organ that is purchased ahead of time by someone who then travels to China for a transplant operation. It is a huge source of revenue both for the Chinese military and for private hospitals around the country, according to Nobel Prize nominees and investigators David Matas, an international human rights attorney, and David Kilgour, a former Canadian foreign secretary for AsiaPacific.Matas and Kilgour published their first investigative report in 2006 , and evidence about forced harvesting of organs in China from prisoners of conscience has only mounted in the years since. The investigators found that the overwhelming majority of the pool of victims did not come from prisoners sentenced to death but rather from prisoners of conscience, primarily followers of Falun Gong  the largest group in Chinas prisons.In their 2006 report, Matas described the systematic harvesting of organs from Falun Gong adherents by the Chinese Communist Party as a new form of evil we have yet to see on this planet.One of the founding board members of Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting DAFOH, Dr. Dana Churchill, spoke at rallies in Los Angeles and Santa Monica Beach earlier this month. She said that to this point the world had never witnessed a more horrific and barbaric crime as the Chinese Communist Party has committed against Falun Gong. Crime against humanity She added that it wasnt just Falun Gong adherents who were being victimized, however. Others include Christians, the Uyghurs and Tibetans, all of whom have also had their organs harvested while they are alive, unwilling, and between 20 and 40 years old, the prime of their life, Churchill  a naturopathic doctor from Pasadena, Calif., said. Epoch Times noted that recently released findings on the number of Chinese prisoners who have been murdered go way beyond original estimates collected from various investigators and organizations.Churchill said With Falun Gong, approximately 65,000 have been murdered, and that is according to DAFOH, our organization.At a Washington, D.C., rally on July 17, 2015, following nine years of investigation, the World Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong announced that it had concluded that since July 20, 1999, the Chinese Communist Party CCP, lead by its former head Jiang Zemin, has utilized Chinas entire state apparatus to harvest organs from living Falun Gong practitioners, as a way to physically destroy the group as a whole.This is genocide and a crime against humanity, the organization concluded.

"Top university stole millions from taxpayers by faking global warming research   J. D. Heyes NaturalNews The global warming/climate change charade is bad enough in that it is nothing more than a politically motivated issue used by globalists of all political stripes to gain more control over the worlds population.But now its costing some citizens scarce tax dollars.As reported by The Daily Caller , a top university in Britain has been caught stealing millions of taxpayer dollars from a federal budget that is chronically in the red just to produce phony global warming data .A global warming research center at the London School of Economics received millions of dollars pounds from UK taxpayers after taking credit for research it did not perform.The UKs Daily Mail noted further that the UK government provided 9 million 11 million in US dollars in funding to the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy CCCEP in exchange for research that was never done. Massive scientific fraud regarding global warming A number of papers that CCCEP claimed to have published to receive government funding were not even about global warming and were written before the organization was even founded, or written by researchers who were not affiliated with the center. Worse, government officials never bothered to check CCCEPs alleged publication lists, saying instead they were taken on trust, according to a recently released report.It is serious misconduct to claim credit for a paper you havent supported, and its fraud to use that in a bid to renew a grant, Professor Richard Tol, a climate economics expert from Sussex University whose research was reportedly stolen by CCCEP, told the Daily Mail . Ive never come across anything like it before. It stinks.The centers chairman since 2008 has been Nick Stern, a wellknown global advocate for more policy action supposedly aimed at combating climate change. In addition he is also the president of the British Academy, an invitationonly society that is reserved for the academic elite and which disburses grant money in the millions of pounds to researchers, as well as Lord Sterns own organization.In recent days the CCCEP, which is jointly based at the London School of Economics and the University of Leeds, hosted a gala event that was attended by experts and officials from around the world. The occasion A celebration to mark the 10th anniversary of the Stern Review, a 700page report detailing the alleged economic impact of climate change, a review that was commissioned by Tony Blairs government.The massive paper claimed that the world must take immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or face dramatically higher costs in the future. The review exerted a great amount of power and influence on a series of British governments, as well as international organizations.But now the reports contents and conclusions are in serious doubt. Not the first time global warming data has been FAKED Following the Daily Mail s report, CCCEP spokesman Bob Ward admitted the organization had made mistakes, in both claiming credit for studies it did not perform and foro papers that were actually researched and published by other academics.Academics and experts whose work was falsely represented were furious, including one who said CCCEPs actions were a clear case of fraud  using deception for financial gain, The DC reported.Studies receiving financial support from the public sector are not required to disclose it as an ethical conflict of interest, even when financial support is in the millions of dollars. The DC noted that recent studies in the United States, which the Environmental Protection Agency EPA uses to support the scientific case for its massive new power plant regulations, the Clean Power Plan, saw the agency give 32.1 million, 9.5 million, and 3.65 million in public funds to lead authors  all of whom essentially provided the agency with the results it wanted.As Natural News founder and editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, reported in June 2014 , this isnt the first time socalled global warming/climate change data has been faked.

"Top 10 toxins that are poisoning your kids   Amy Goodrich Tags toxins , childrens health , poisoning NaturalNews Toxins are everywhere. They are lurking in the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat. Young children are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects our modern lifestyle creates. They can suffer profound and permanent adverse health effects which affect their developing brain and nervous system.A leading group of U.S. scientists, medical experts, and health organizations said that they are witnessing a dramatic increase in learning and behavioral issues in children. Therefore, they called for chemicals to be banned at the first sign of danger rather than waiting for direct, scientific proof.Our failures to protect children from harm underscore the urgent need for a better approach to developing and assessing scientific evidence and using it to make decisions, the experts said.Here are the top ten toxins that our kids are exposed to on a daily basis. 1. Mercury fillings Europe, Norway, and Sweden banned mercuryleaching amalgams nearly a decade ago. Nonetheless, dental offices across the U.S. continue to use these toxic substances in their everyday practice. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC, exposure to high levels of mercury can cause lung damage, while prolonged low exposure may result in memory loss, neurological impairment, kidney abnormalities, and skin rashes. 2. Vaccines As stated by the National Vaccine Information Center , a typical child receives about 49 recommended doses of 14 toxinladen vaccines before the age of six. Heres a short list of the most common toxic chemicals found in vaccines formaldehyde used to preserve dead things, mercury, aluminum associated with Alzheimers, GMO yeast, antibiotics, and monosodium glutamate MSG. 3. Prescription drugs Overprescribing doctors, with close ties to the Big Pharma are a real treat when it comes to your childs safety. Writing for Blogs Natural News , Dr. Brent Hunter explained that some of these drugs are the legal versions of addictive street drugs. Take ADHD medication as an example. These commonly prescribed drugs are quite similar to drugs like meth and speed. 4. Monosodium glutamate MSG MSG is a common, artificial food additive with neurotoxic effects. It has been linked to numerous health problems like brain lesions, obesity, malformed organs, abnormal reproductive systems, infertility, aggression, antisocial behavior, and high cholesterol. 5. Processed and fast foods We all know that processed or fast foods are bad news . They are loaded with artificial synthetic chemicals, preservatives, nitrates and artificial colors and flavors which have been linked to a host of adverse health effects. 6. Toxins in personal care products When you read the label of personal care products such as body washes, moisturizers, deodorants, and toothpaste, you might not recognize most of their ingredients. When these chemicals seep into the skin, they can cause devastating, longterm effects. Opt for nontoxic, organic alternatives instead. 7. Toxins in Laundry detergent If your laundry detergent has a strong, nice fragrance, chances are it is packed with cancercausing toxins. Some of these chemicals can be absorbed through your skin. 8. Toxic cleaning products Keep out of reach of children, is not an uncommon phrase on the label of cleaning products. While we all know that they can be harmful or fatal when swallowed, Dr. Brent Hunter said that we dont need to drink them to experience the damaging sideeffects. These chemicals can also end up in our body through inhalation or contact with the skin. 9. Pesticides Pesticides are everywhere. They are in our home, the environment, and the food we eat. Opting for natural pest control and organic, homegrown foods is your best chance to avoid these toxins from entering your home. 10. Soda Sodas are loaded with phosphoric acid which weakens your childs bones and teeth. Furthermore, they contain high amounts of high fructose corn syrup that causes obesity and diabetes.

"Food mixology When eaten together, these foods can boost health   Isabelle Z. Tags nutrients , food pairings , turmeric NaturalNews If you are making a conscious effort to eat nutritious food, you are already stacking the odds in your favor when it comes to your health and wellbeing. However, eating all the organic fruits and vegetables in the world is not going to do much for you if your body is not prepared to absorb the nutrients they contain.To be clear, eating a diet that is rich in organic produce, whole grains, and a reasonable amount of healthy fats is always preferable to a diet full of fried food, sugar and processed foods. However, if you want to maximize the benefits of your smart eating choices, you should try some of these food pairings to enhance nutrient absorption and give your health a boost. Milk and honey Your grandmother might have offered you a glass of warm milk with honey when you struggled to fall asleep as a child, and this triedandtrue combination has stood the test of time for good reason it is a very effective pairing for your health. An amino acid found in milk known as tryptophan is used by the brain to make melatonin and serotonin, while the carbohydrates in honey can help with the uptake of tryptophan. Turmeric and black pepper The active ingredient in turmeric, curcumin, has antiinflammatory properties, but it tends to be poorly absorbed by the body. Interestingly, the piperine found in black pepper can help boost its absorption significantly, which is why many supplements contain both ingredients. Try cooking a dish that contains generous amounts of turmeric , like curry, and add a sprinkling of black pepper. A tiny pinch of pepper can enhance your absorption of curcumin by more than 2,000 percent Green tea and lemon If you are drinking green tea for its extraordinary antioxidant content, you might want to start adding some organic lemon juice to your cup. Thats because Purdue University researchers have discovered that mixing green tea with lemon juice can significantly boost the amount of antioxidants that are available for your body to absorb. The catechins in green tea can help protect your body against cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimers disease. Olive oil and tomatoes These two Mediterranean diet staples go hand in hand, and its easy to see why. Tomatoes contain antioxidants that can protect your body from disease, and adding a small amount of healthy fat to carotenoidrich foods like tomatoes can increase its absorption. Try making a simple salad of chopped tomatoes drizzled in extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar to reap the benefits. The lycopene in tomatoes is also better absorbed when they are heated first, so take this one step further and make a tomato sauce or pizza sauce by cooking tomatoes and adding olive oil and www.herbs.news  targetblankwww.herbs.newsfresh herbs like oregano. Beans and cauliflower People who follow plantbased diets often rely on beans to get iron, but this type of iron is not as easily absorbed by the human body as iron that comes from meat sources. You can increase your bodys absorption of the iron from beans by consuming a food that is rich in vitamin C at the same time, and cauliflower fits the bill quite nicely. Pair cauliflower with green beans or garbanzos to give your body an iron boost. You can also try other iron and vitamin C pairings , like strawberries with oatmeal.While all of these foods are quite healthy on their own, if you are looking to increase your intake of certain nutrients, make sure you are opting for food pairings and preparation methods that will boost absorption so you can reap the most benefits.

"Jimmy Johns owner spent 350k to trophy hunt extremely endangered female Black Rhino Tuesday, November 01, 2016 by Ethan A. Huff, staff writer Tags Jimmy Johns , endangered species , trophy hunting NaturalNews The owner of the American fast food chain Jimmy Johns is under fire after photos emerged of him smiling and giving a thumbs up beside numerous endangered species that hes hunted and killed throughout Africa over the years, for seemingly no other purpose than simply to invoke death for pleasure.Reports indicate that Jimmy John Liautaud has been spending hundreds of thousands of dollars per hunting trip to gain access to these precious species, including one particular trophy hunt in which he spent a whopping 350,000 just to kill an extremely endangered female Black Rhino. Graphic photos of Liautaud with this rhino and other animals are available here , but be warned these images are horrifyingly upsetting.Liautauds trophy hunts are apparently a routine pastime of his, just as they are for the many other bored millionaires out there with too much time and money on their hands who seem to get a kick out of taking out the rarest animals on our planet  beautiful creatures like leopards, rhinos, lions, and even elephants, which have the largest brains of any land animals. Its the type of thing that, if more people knew about it, theyd likely stop eating at Jimmy Johns altogether.Mr. Jimmy Johns poaching fetish has been making the media rounds, and many are now calling on a national boycott of the sandwich chain, which has already been exposed for underpaying its employees and treating them like slave workers. The Wall Street Journal WSJ reported that social media users had attempted to launch a boycott of Jimmy Johns using the #boycottjimmyjohns hashtag on Twitter, though the company didnt seem all that phased.Still, the issue hasnt gone away, and many in the public remain outraged over what they say is reckless and reprehensible behavior. Not only is Liautaud killing these rare and exotic animals in cold blood, but hes doing so in such an utterly cruel way that even the most avid hunters would be hardpressed not to cringe or perhaps shed a few tears.Usually the animals are lured from a national park on to private property, Lara Starr, investigative writer and cofounder of The Earth Child writes, noting that this is not the method Liautaud uses to kill his prey. Trophy hunters will leave out bait, play the sounds of other animals to lure them in, or a few other tactics to find their animal victims.Canned hunting is even worse, she adds. It is the shooting fish in a barrel version of trophy hunting . The animals are often hand raised so they are tame and dont run away. They leave food out for them one day, then some coward creeps up and shoots them with a high powered bow or rifle. Sometimes they dont even have to creep. Sometimes they just shoot them from the back of a truck, then go back to drinking their gin  tonic like it was just a bit of harmless fun. Trophy hunting costs do NOT help repopulate endangered animal species One of the excuses often used as justification for expensive trophy hunting escapades is that all that cash ends up getting donated to conservation programs that help repopulate the prairies, plains, and jungles with endangered species. But this isnt actually true, as only about two percent of the proceeds from these hunts ends up being used for conservation purposes.Nontrophy hunting tourism, on the other hand, is responsible for the bulk of conservation donations  up to 15 times than what trophy hunting contributes  according to Heather Callaghan, editor of Natural Blaze . Likewise, the claim that animals killed on trophy hunts are used to provide food for locals is also bunk, as most of the carcasses end up getting left behind for scavengers. Sources",junksci
"Dakota Access Pipeline violence grows as militarized police use extreme force, tear gas on praying protesters Tuesday, November 01, 2016 by J. D. Heyes Tags Dakota Access Pipeline , protestors , police violence NaturalNews Tensions are ratcheting up in a region of North Dakota where construction of a pipeline that will take oil to a refinery facility in Illinois is being built, as protestors objecting to the project are clashing with increasingly militarized police . The Bismark Tribune reported that police and protestors clashed as authorities moved in to break up a camp on private property belonging to the pipeline developers.Protestors had initially formed a line of no surrender, the paper said, but it became a line of retreat in the face of a militarized police presence that overwhelmed hundreds of Dakota Access Pipeline protestors, pushing them back from the front line of resistance to their main camp.For about five hours on Thursday, beginning around noon, police officers pressed the protesters back about a halfmile on N.D. Highway 1806, which was away from a new camp they had built earlier in the week that sat directly atop the pipeline easement. Rubber bullets, bean bags, smoke grenades and tasers Unrest continued into the evening hours, however, as police said that two fires were started on a nearby bridge, and protestors began lobbing Molotov cocktails at officers. In addition, police reported two incidents where shots were fired.The Tribune reported that one woman allegedly fired a handgun in the direction of police as she was being arrested, while an armed man who was reportedly run off the road by protesters, and was perhaps not connected to the protest, had to be treated for a gunshot wound to the hand.As police moved in, some protestors were urging calm and prayer, but others threw rocks and water bottles at approaching officers. Eventually the crowd retreated under a barrage of pepper spray, rubber and bean bag bullets, smoke grenades and tasers.By late afternoon, flames and thick plumes of smoke belched out of the cab of one of three Dakota Access Pipeline earth movers, while protestors walked back to their main camp on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers land.In all, police arrested 141 people, the local sheriffs department said, charging suspects with engaging in a riot, maintaining a public nuisance, and conspiracy to endanger by fire and explosion.A day before the violence, as reported by AMI Newswire , opponents of the pipeline barricaded a highway and pitched their camp on private land. These actions were led by members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.The previous weekend some 127 people had been arrested.Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault II issued a statement last week in which he blamed the rising militarization of police for the increased tensions.The militarization of local law enforcement and enlistment of multiple law enforcement agencies from neighboring states is needlessly escalating violence and unlawful arrests against peaceful protesters at Standing Rock, Archambault said, as quoted by AMI Newswire . We do not condone reports of illegal actions, but believe the majority of peaceful protesters are reacting to strongarm tactics and abuses by law enforcement. Destruction of burial grounds, water are chief concerns Law enforcement officers countered by saying that, for the vast majority of the protest thus far, they have shown remarkable patience and restraint, and that they only moved after protestors became more aggressive.Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier ticked off a list of alleged violations by protestors, including buzzing a police helicopter with a drone and firing arrows in the direction of officers. He also said that journalists had been harassed and security personnel assaulted.For months protesters have described us as an aggressive police force, Kirchmeier said in a prepared statement, AMI Newswire reported. We have done nothing but demonstrate patience and restraint.Protestors are angry about the pipeline stretching across ancient burial grounds, NewsTarget reported , as well as the potential for pipeline leaks that would pollute local water sources .

A common cold is caused by a virus, so there is no point in taking antibiotics which only kill bacteria. While there is a host of overthecounter remedies available to soothe the symptoms of a common cold, nature offers far better and safer solutions.We all know the prevention drill. Load up on immune boosting foods rich in vitamin C , exercise regularly and wash your hands often. But what else is there you can do to avoid a runny nose, sore throat or a cough Seven Health editors reveal their sicknesspreventing secrets. Gargle salt water If you feel the first signs of a scratchy throat, Jeannie Kim, executive deputy editor, recommends a saltwater gargle. She is convinced that it has stopped countless of her colds. To soothe a sore throat and kill the sickmaking germs, combine half a teaspoon salt with one cup of water and gargle. Repeat several times a day until scratchiness disappears. Create some heat According to Clare McHugh, editorinchief, a hot bath or shower is the thing you need. She explains that viruses that cause a common cold dont like the heat and are discouraged to multiply if you keep your body warm. And why not add immune boosting and cold fighting essential oils to your bathtub to enhance the healing effectFurthermore, you could try the good old hot water bottle to help loosen phlegm and deep congestions in the chest. Swallow raw garlic If you dont mind to sweat it out and have a garlic breath, Lisa Lombardi, executive editor, recommends eating or swallowing raw garlic. While the next day her symptoms usually get worse, she feels better in 3 days.If you cannot stomach garlics taste and spiciness, then you might want to go with the traditional garlic cure which consists of garlic, lemon, and honey. Crush one clove of garlic and add it to a cup of warm water with one teaspoon of honey and the juice of one lemon. Give it a good stir and repeat this remedy two to three times a day for the duration of your symptoms. Take Echinacea Michael Gollust, the research editor, swears by echinacea lozenges. He says that while they dont stop a cold in its tracks, they definitely reduce the severity of the symptoms. The BBC, however, reports on a comprehensive review that scanned the literature and included only the very best studies, showing that people who use echinacea may also have 10 to 20 percent less chance to catch a common cold. Stay hydrated Most Health experts agree that hydration is essential for a speedy recovery. Anthea Levi, the editorial assistant, adds that if you are struggling with blocked sinuses, adding lemon juice and cayenne pepper to your glass of water is all you need to breathe freely again. Go to bed early They often say sleep is one the best natural doctors. Tomoko Takeda Canel, the acting beauty director, couldnt agree more. When she gets sick, she cancels all her plans, has a light meal and then prioritizes an early bedtime to get better.Next time you get a cold, keep these tips and tricks in mind, and you wont need overthecounter drugs that can do more harm than good.

"FDA to withdraw 2 generic ADHD drugs after determining they have no therapeutic effects Tuesday, November 01, 2016 by Vicki Batts Tags FDA , ADHD drugs , market withdrawal NaturalNews ADHD medications have been subject to public scrutiny for quite some time. Two years ago, the FDA said it had discovered problems with a generic version of a popular ADHD drug known as Concerta. The generic, produced by the pharmaceutical company Mallinckrodt, just wasnt up to snuff. And now, the FDA seems to finally be making moves to pull this inferior product off the shelves.Generic drugs are approved by the FDA through their abbreviated new drug application ANDA process. In the ANDA process, the federal agency is primarily focused on data that shows the generic drug is a bioequivalent for the reference listed drug, or what many people refer to as the brand name drug.The term bioequivalent means that there is no substantial differences in bioavailability between a generic drug and the brand name product. Specifically, it suggests that the extent and rate of absorption of two drug equivalents over the same period of time, at the same dose and under the same conditions, should exhibit similar results. As the FDA explains on their website, The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a patients bloodstream in the same amount of time as the pioneer drug.Unsurprisingly, discrepancies in actual equivalence are often discovered after a generic has been approved.Mallinckrodts Concerta generic is not the only brand name knockoff under fire. Kremers Urban Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of the Lannett Company, also manufactures a generic form of the medication that the FDAs Center for Drug Evaluation and Research CDER has deemed insufficient.As reported by the Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society CDER tracked the issues from December 2013 through June 2014, ran a reanalysis of bioequivalence data and determined that the Mallinckrodt product may deliver methylphenidate into the body at a slower rate than Concerta during the time period of 7 to 12 hours postdosing. Following the CDERs findings, Mallinckrodt filed a lawsuit, which was thrown out by a Maryland federal judge. The pharmaceutical company has since declined to voluntarily withdraw their product from the marketplace. And according to the FDA, the drug manufacturer has yet to submit any new data or information that confirms the bioequivalence of their product to Concerta.Similarly, the CDER concluded in June of 2014 that the data on the Kremers product is insufficient to determine whether or not their generic product is therapeutically equivalent to Concerta. In November that year, the FDA announced that their product was not sufficiently equivalent to the name brand.Both manufacturers may submit a request for a hearing to the FDA within the next month so they can attempt to show why approval for their drugs shouldnt be withdrawn.Of course, the FDAs concerns about the apparent lack of efficacy seen in these generic drugs is rather ironic, given the magnitude of other concerns surrounding these drugs. In 2006, a CBS News report revealed that 25 people died and 54 more suffered serious cardiovascular problems following the use of ADHD medication, in a period of just four years.That may not seem like a lot, but is important to recall that the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System FAERS, which is used to track such events, is a voluntary system. Only drug manufacturers are required to report adverse events  if they know about them. Doctors, patients and family members are under no such obligation. PSQH reports that drug safety experts estimate that only about 10 percent of all adverse events will even be reported  who is to say how many people have been harmed by ADHD medications and other drugs and dont know it or havent reported itThe FAERS website itself states that because of its own limitations, FAERS data cannot be used to calculate the incidence of an adverse event or medication error in the U.S. population. And yet, in spite of this very statement, the FDA itself used this information to form a safety reportOver the years, several ADHD medications, like Adderall XR, have been linked to sudden death , cardiovascular problems and psychosis. According to Consumer Reports , the longterm safety of these drugs has not been evaluated or studied sufficiently, and there is evidence to suggest that the benefit of such drugs wears off after about two years. Many kids take ADHD medication for quite a bit longer than that.In spite of all of this, the FDA has yet to pull these drugs from the shelves, and is instead concerned with drugs that arent strong enough. Medications that dont work obviously dont belong in the marketplace. However, drugs that are killing children dont belong there either. Sources",junksci
"How To Remove Uric Acid Crystallization in Joints http//blogs.naturalnews.com/removeuricacidcrystallizationjoints/ By Twain Yobra Posted Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 0354pm EDT Joint pain prevents us from exercising or doing simple tasks like walking. Unfortunately, it only gets worse as we age. This happens because the fluid synovial fluid in the joints reduces as we age. Reduction of this fluid increases friction on the joints and leads to arthritis. But research also shows that uric acid can cause arthritis. Buildup of uric acid in the joints can damage joint tissues and cause pain. The buildup happens when the kidneys dont excrete enough uric acid. It can also be triggered by the body converting purines to uric acid fast. Longterm buildup of uric acid can cause inflammation and reduce your mobility. Switch to an Alkaline Diet Theres been a neverending argument about whether alkaline diets reduce acidity in the body or not. In fact, some experts have discredited them as useless. But what does research say Well, this study found that alkaline diet enhances excretion of uric acid through urine. On the other hand, researchers found that acidic foods reduce excretion of uric acid. Another study affirms that alkaline diets can help reduce uric acid in the body. And they can prevent uric acid crystallization in joints. Note that more research needs to be conducted on effect of diet on uric acid crystal. Eat these alkaline foods You simply need to reduce intake of acidic foods and eat more alkaline foods. Alkaline foods are mostly vegetables and legumes. Red pepper",junksci

"Keywords Alzhemiers disease , anxiety , dementia , depression , food , health , IBD , IBS , immune system , mental health , nutrition , weight loss Fermented Foods 5 Reasons to Consume this food Group Every Day Im sure you have heard about fermented foods and are wondering if this is just a fad. Here are some reasons why fermented foods should not be just a fad but a food group to keep in your diet daily. What are Fermented Foods Bacteria and yeast are used as part of the fermentation process that gives these foods a nutritional boost. The bacteria convert sugars and starches into lactic acid through a process called lactofermentation. The yeast undergoes a process called ethanol fermentation. These yeasts and bacteria that undergo the fermentation process boosts the nutritional content of the food. What it does to the food Provides beneficial bacteria that promote gut health Provides beneficial enzymes Increases the amount of B vitamins, biotin, and folate. Increases the bioavailability of minerals. Provides short chain fatty acids which helps to improve your immune function Provides you with GABA, your calming neurotransmitter How can eating fermented foods help me Optimize your Gut Health Why this may not seem like a big deal, it is. Your immune system is in your gut and much of your serotonin is made in your gut. Your gut may be in bad shape from NSAIDS, antibiotics, unknown food allergies, the standard American diet and more. Ideally you want more good bacteria populating your gut as opposed to bad bacteria. Fermented foods can help shift the balance since most people who consume the Standard American crap food diet have a disrupted microbiome. So, you can take all the supplements in the world, but if your gut is in bad shape, are you even absorbing and benefiting from these supplements or are you just wasting your money A healthy gut can help to balance and support your endocrine system, immune system, digestive system, and nervous system. So, as you can see, a healthy gut is critical to your wellbeing. Support your Immune System The more beneficial bacteria you have, the stronger your immune system is to fight off colds, flu, allergies and more. Almost 80 of your immune system is found in your gut, thus, it stands to reason that to maintain a strong immune system, one needs to support their gut health. Asthma and autoimmune conditions, among numerous other health issues, are all linked to having fewer good bacteria in your gut. The less diverse your microbiota is, the greater association with many chronic health issues. Adding in probiotic rich fermented foods can also shorten the duration of a cold or upper respiratory infection. Aid in weight loss Studies show that those with certain healthy bacteria in their gut can maintain a healthy weight while those with more negative strains have a greater incidence of gaining weight/difficulty losing weight. Obese people have different gut bacteria than lean individuals. In a 2011 study, it was found that kimchee had a significant impact on weight and body fat of those who are overweight and obese in the study. In a 2010 study, obese people were assigned to drink fermented milk for 12 weeks. Those that drank the fermented milk had significant fat loss as compared to the control group. Digestive/Bowel Issue Improvement Those with IBS or IBD may have reduced symptoms of diarrhea and constipation when fermented foods are added into the daily diet. Dr. David Williams states that to eliminate digestive issues, you need to improve the balance in the gut microbiome and one of the most effective ways of doing so is by adding in fermented foods. Kefir in studies, has shown to improve symptoms of IBS and IBD. Research has shown that anywhere from 50 to 75 of those who make this change Adding in fermented foods will notice a significant difference in their IBS symptoms. Improved mental health, mood control and behavior. The gut is considered your second brain. A healthy gut therefore can mean a healthy brain. Several probiotic strains have been shown to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety in short term studies. For this reason, to get more variety of probiotic strains, it is best to not stick with the same fermented food to eat over and over. Mix it up for instance, have kefir one day, kombucha the next, fermented vegetables the next day and so forth. Many of you know that GABA is your calming neurotransmitter. But did you know that fermented foods can supply you with GABA too Oral administration of fermented rice bran and other traditional fermented foods have been shown to increase GABA content significantly Whereas GABA in the oral form may have limited benefits due to absorption issues. Another study looking at 700 college students found that those who ate a variety of fermented foods has less negative emotions than before such as anxiety, fear, moodiness, worry, envy, frustration, and loneliness. It is possible that the fermented foods not only healed leaky gut but also provided some needed GABA. Even in psychiatry they are starting to recognize the benefits of fermented foods for mood disorders. Reduce the risk of brain diseases such as Alzheimers. Some scientists have recently begun to consider the possibility that Alzheimers Disease is in fact an autoimmune disease. And as many of you may know, having one autoimmune condition puts you at risk for more autoimmune conditions down the road. For any autoimmune disease, the immune system must be supported. So, it would make sense that gut health needs to be addressed for AD. If you want to support your brain than I suggest that you add in fermented foods. Along with the benefits above, fermented foods can also benefit those with Autism and help prevent HPylori. You dont need a whole lot of fermented foods daily. Start with small amounts until you know how your body will react and slowly build your way up to say 3 tablespoons of fermented vegetables or a cup of kefir per day. What to add in Look for the product to say raw and fermented. These foods should be in the refrigerator section of the store. Sauerkraut or other fermented vegetables  eat these cold, dont heat them up. Bubbies pickles is a great way to get introduced to fermented foods. Kimchee  this is a Korean version of fermented cabbage, carrots, onions and garlic. Kefir usually made from cows milk but is also made from goat milk or coconut milk. It has more of a drinkable texture than yogurt. I buy goat milk kefir and find that it is relatively thick and mix in some of my paleo granola and have this for breakfast. If you suspect any issues with milk it is best to opt for the coconut kefir or the goat milk kefir. If you have asthma or chronic sinus congestion, avoid the kefir until issues resolve. Opt for the other fermented choices instead. Tempeh Indonesian type of cake with a nutty taste and chewy texture. A good vegan source of protein too. Kombucha  a fizzy fermented tea. Most stores carry a variety of flavors now. Dont go overboard on the kombucha however. Some people who drink kombucha in excess amounts i.e. several bottles per day report symptoms of gas and bloating. Miso a fermented soybean paste which can be used in soups and sauces. A miso broth soup is a great way to start a meal and very easy to make. Notice I did not sat yogurt. While some yogurts may contain some probiotics, many others are sugary processed foods in disguise. Yogurt is also not going to pack as powerful of a punch as the abovementioned foods.

"What we all should be doing first thing in the morning A simple, cheap and effective way to jump start your metabolism, weight loss and improve your health What if I told you that by doing this every day, making it part of your morning routine just like brushing your teeth, would help you to lose weight, flush out toxins, hydrate your body and skin, improve brain function, give you more energy and decrease your appetite, would you do it Drinking water upon rising in the morning can have huge health benefits Some people call it water therapy and has its origination in Ayurvedic medicine. It is purported to help with numerous diseases such as cancer, asthma, high blood pressure, arthritis, diabetes and migraines. To reap the benefits, drink the water upon waking ideally 45 minutes before you eat and make it part of your morning routine. Most us are walking around in a dehydrated state. So, start your day off the right way Ideally filtered water that is void of chemicals and fluoride is best. I personally like the Berkey filter system as this is affordable for many instead of a whole house system. Most water pitchers are ineffective for removing most of the chemicals in our water but there are a couple good ones out there such as the Clearly Filtered pitcher. But even if you dont have a water filter system, it does not mean you should not drink up. For most people 16 oz. of water in the morning is the right amount. Others say to drink double this amount. This may be a lot of water to consume for most people first thing in the morning. My suggestion would be to start out with 8 oz. and slowly work your way up to the higher amount and see how you feel. Moderation is key as too little or too much water is never a good thing. The 8 glasses filled with 8 oz. of water is a myth and no science behind this reasoning. Another simple rule is to divide your body weight in half and drink this amount in ounces. But if you are a large person, this may feel like you are spending your day drinking water Instead focus on getting that glass of water first thing in the day and then add in water, herbal teas, fruits and vegetables during the day. If your urine is very pale yellow throughout the day, then you are hydrated. If it is a bright yellow to orange, drink up Riboflavin, a B vitamin can make your urine a bright yellow. Benefits to drinking water first thing in the morning It can jump start your metabolism It can increase your metabolism by 24 for the first 90 minutes after consuming that glass of water. Another study showed that it can increase your metabolic rate by 30 for the next 40 minutes after the water is consumed. Hydration This is more important that you think. When dehydrated, we may experience brain fog, lack of energy and metal clarity. Hydrating in the morning can increase the flow of oxygen which is energizing. Hydrating will also help the skin to look younger. Flushes out toxins Support your kidneys by helping them to flush out toxins and give your body the water it needs first thing in the a.m. Speed up the detox process by adding a tablespoon of lemon juice to your morning water. This is best done prior to brushing your teeth in the morning as the film on your teeth will protect the enamel from the acidity in the lemon juice. Support brain health Your brain tissue is 75 water. Not having enough water can make you feel tired, drained and can cause mood swings.

"Keywords medical equipment , Stethoscope facts , stethoscopes history When we hear the word Doctor, the first image comes in our mind is a person in a white coat with a stethoscope hanging around his neck. The stethoscope has become a very common name amongst people thanks to its display in various T.V shows, movies and frequent use of it by doctors. But still, there are many fun facts which other people might not know about stethoscope. So here they are  200 years old history  Yes Stethoscopes are one of the oldest inventions which are still being used across the world by millions of doctors. Rene Laennec in 1819 had invented the stethoscope. It was a wooden instrument and looked quite different from what we see it as now. I see your chest  Stethoscope is a Greek word which roughly translates into I see the chest, stethos means chest and scope mean examination. An Interesting story behind its Invention  When Stethoscope was not invented, doctors would put their ears around the chest of patients and gently tap the chest with fingers. This technique would make female patients little uncomfortable. Rene Laennec was a very shy person. Once he was examining an overweight woman. He found it difficult to hear her hear sounds. To hear heartbeats of that lady, he rolled a quire paper into a tube and placed it on her chest. This inspired him to make the device which we all are familiar with and called stethoscope. Google Doodle For Rene Laennec  On February 17th, 2016, Rene Laennec would have celebrated his 235th birthday. To commemorate this day, Google doodle marked his 235th birthday. Used To Identify If A Person Is Dead Or Not Nowadays stethoscope is used to hear heart sounds and to determine symbols of other diseases. But initially, stethoscope was designed to find out if the person in the hospital is dead or alive. It Might Be Replaced Very Soon As mentioned, stethoscopes were invented almost 200 years ago and being in use for such a long time shows that how useful and efficient stethoscopes are. However, as the technology is getting advanced every passing day, stethoscopes might be replaced very soon by pocketsized ultrasonic devices which can perform multiple measurements on patients.

"Keywords cranberries , cranberry , cranberry juice , kidney disease , urinary tract infections , UTI , UTIs Cranberry juice and tablets have been recommended as a way to either prevent recurring urinary tract infection UTI, or treat the symptoms. But a new study finds theres no difference between people treated with cranberries or placebos. A lack of evidence for cranberry juice or capsules as being an effective preventative measure or treatment has been a recurring argument in the scientific literature for years now. Cranberry Juice  An Unrealistic Recommendation for UTIs A urinary tract infection occurs when bacteria gets into your urine and travels up to your bladder. According to the Urinary Care Foundation , UTIs cause more than 8.1 million visits to health care providers each year. About 10 in 25 women and 3 in 25 men will have symptoms of at least one UTI during their lifetime. For years now, cranberry juice has been recommended to aid in preventing or treating UTIs. However, theres no solid evidence that any amount is having a positive effect. Additionally, based on the results of a recent study led by infectious disease specialist Manisha JuthaniMehta from the Yale School of Medicine, even if you switch to highly concentrated capsules, you still dont see a noticeable positive effect. In response to this recent study, Lindsay E. Nicolle, an expert on UTIs from the University of Manitoba advises the following The continuing promotion of cranberry use to prevent recurrent UTI in the popular press or online advice seems inconsistent with the reality of repeated negative studies or positive studies compromised by methodological shortcomings. Nicolle adds, Clinicians should not be promoting cranberry use by suggesting that there is proven, or even possible benefit. Any continued promotion of the use of cranberry products seems to go beyond available scientific evidence and rational reasoning. It is time to move on from cranberries. Myth versus Facts Theres a couple of reasons why the myth that cranberry juice is beneficial in preventing and treating UTIs has persisted for so long. First, the active ingredient in cranberries  Atype proanthocyanidins PACs  has been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to the wall of the bladder. So, a vast majority of people have reasoned that if bacteria are causing UTIs, something that blocks bacteria from accumulating in the bladder could be a potential preventive or treatment measure. But, according to Timothy Boone, M.D., Ph.D., vice dean of the Texas AM Health Science Center College of Medicine Houston campus and chairperson of the department of urology for Houston Methodist Hospital, theres one problem . Cranberry juice, especially the juice concentrates you find at the grocery store, will not treat a UTI or bladder infection, It can offer more hydration and possibly wash bacteria from your body more effectively, but the active ingredient in cranberry is longgone by the time it reaches your bladder. Dr. Boone adds, It takes an extremely large concentration of cranberry to prevent bacterial adhesion. This amount of concentration is not found in the juices we drink. Theres a possibility it was stronger back in our grandparents day, but definitely not in modern times. For example, Ocean Sprays cranberry juice cocktail is only 27 percent juice. Something so watered down could not be so ineffective. The second reason the myth continues is that its a tempting myth to believe. If you experience recurring UTIs and want to prevent them  or you want to feel empowered while youre waiting for the antibiotics to take effect  drinking cranberry juice or taking capsules is a fairly easy and simple way to feel like youre helping resolve your problem. Unfortunately, though, youre paying a lot of money for something thats only really doing the same job as a glass of water. And cranberry juice is full of sugar anyway. Golden Rules for Kidney Health You can do a number of things to help keep your kidneys functioning properly at every stage of life. Heres a list of ways to reduce the risk of kidney disease  including urinary tract infections. Drink plenty of liquids, especially water . Drinking water helps dilute your urine and ensures that youll urinate more frequently  allowing bacteria to be flushed from your urinary tract before an infection can begin. Stay active and keep fit . Keeping fit helps to reduce your blood pressure. Staying active and keeping fit also reduces the risk of chronic kidney disease. Eat healthy and keep your weight in check . This can help prevent diabetes, heart disease, and other debilitating conditions associated with chronic kidney disease. Reduce your salt intake . The recommended sodium intake is 56 grams of salt per day  around a teaspoon. Try limiting the amount of processed and restaurant food. And dont add salt to food. Its easier to control your salt intake if you prepare the food yourself with fresh ingredients. Dont take overthecounter pills on a regular basis . Common nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs  like ibuprofen  are known to cause kidney damage and disease if taken regularly. This type of medication probably doesnt pose considerable danger if your kidneys are reasonably healthy and you use them for emergencies only. However, if you are dealing with chronic pain  like back pain or arthritis  work with your doctor to find natural ways to control your pain without putting your kidneys at risk. Wipe from front to back . Doing so after urinating and after a bowel movement helps prevent bacteria in the anal region from spreading to the vagina and urethra. Change your birth control method . Diaphragms, or unlubricated or spermicidetreated condoms, can all contribute to bacterial growth. Avoid potentially irritating feminine products . Using deodorant sprays or other feminine products, such as douches and powders, in the genital area can irritate the urethra. Empty your bladder soon after intercourse . Also, drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria. Regularly control of your blood sugar level . About half of people who have diabetes develop kidney damage, so it is important for people with diabetes to have regular tests to check their kidney functions. This recent randomized clinical trial study titled, Effect of Cranberry Capsules on Bacteriuria Plus Pyuria Among Older Women in Nursing Homes, is published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

"Clinton operative Dirty Donna Brazile is the kind of political filth we need to eradicate from Washington DC She let Hillary Clinton CHEAT at the debates Tuesday, November 01, 2016 Tags Donna Brazile , cheating democrats , racketeering NaturalNews Dirty Donna Brazile. Political filth on display. The stench of dirty democrat tactics has now reached a new, nauseating milestone in America with the revelation that Dirty Donna Brazile, a DNC operative working for Clinton, smuggled debate questions out of CNN and handed them over to the Clinton camp before the debates ever took place so that Hillary Clinton could CHEAT.Yes, Hillary Clinton CHEATED in the debates. As Ive said all along, they were 100 rigged by CNN, the Clinton News Network, which now functions as the propaganda front of the criminal Clinton cartel seeking to steal power by crushing the very concept of open, fair and free elections in America.CNN commentator Donna Brazile, who is now the chair of the Democratic National Committee, was caught again passing debate questions from the network to the Clinton campaign during the Democratic primary, reports Breitbart.com .Dirty Donna Brazile was caught so blatantly that even CNN had to fire her to create the appearance that CNN is still engaged in something resembling ethical journalism. Funneling town hall and debate questions to Hillary Clinton days before the events... The Daily Caller adds even more stunning revelations to the depths of cheating carried out by Dirty Donna Brazile on behalf of the corrupt, criminalminded Clintons Donna Brazile, the interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, began providing town hall and debate questions to the Clinton campaign earlier than previously known, emails released by WikiLeaks on Monday show.The email threads also show that Brazile, a former CNN contributor, revealed to the Clinton campaign the name of the person who provided her with a question that was asked of Clinton at a March 13 town hall cohosted by CNN and TV One. Brazile also shared a question from a debate hosted by CNN a week earlier.A March 12 email exchange shows Brazile stating that she received a town hall question from Roland Martin, a TV One host who comoderated a March 13 town hall with CNNs Jake Tapper.A March 5 email shows that she shared a question with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and communications director Jennifer Palmieri that was to be asked in a March 6 debate hosted by CNN in Flint, Mich. ARREST Brazile, Mills, Podesta, Schultz, Abedin and Clinton What we are all witnessing here with these revelations about cheating, corruption, obstruction of justice, bribery and vote fraud is nothing less than the inner workings of a criminal cartel composed of a modern day political mafia .All these political scumbags need to go to jail. They are all guilty of serious crimes against the United States and against democracy itself. They respect no law. They follow no rules. They cheat, lie, deceive, steal and intimidate their way to power, election after election. They live as legally immune parasites feeding off the blood, sweat and tears of the American middle class who are barely staying afloat while Washington elitists like Brazile, Abedin and Clinton dine on luxury meals like a disturbing scene out of the Hunger Games .But its not President Snow we have to worry about in the real world... its the haunting possibility of a President Clinton. Why We the People must NEVER allow Hillary Clinton to seize the White House We the People must never allow Hillary Clinton to seize the White House. We must halt this sociopathic liar and cheater at the ballot box on November 8th. And once thats accomplished, we must petition President Trump to relentlessly pursue criminal indictments of the HUNDREDS of seditious traitors inside the Clinton regime who have blatantly violated numerous federal laws to commit massive fraud and attempted theft of power across America.There are literally hundreds of these democrat criminals who need to be locked up for life. They are a danger to democracy and a danger to a free society. They are sociopaths, liars, cheats and even murderers. They are fraudsters and political con artists who prey upon the weakminded i.e. democrats who are still so stupid and clueless that theyre voting for Hillary . If we dont stop them now, they threaten to turn America into a Fourth Reich , complete with the mass murder of political dissidents and the silencing of all critics of the Clinton regime.These democrats like Dirty Donna Brazile want to run America like Haiti , complete with all the corruption, bribery, scandals and economic collapse that Third World countries routinely suffer.But filthy scumbags like Brazile are about to find out something rather shocking We the People wont tolerate your lies and corruption any longer We the People are going to arrest you, indict you, prosecute you and see you and your coconspirators behind bars where you belong. The Trump movement is awakening tens of millions of Americans to the astonishing criminality of the democrats in Washington Theres an unstoppable movement rising up in America now that simply will not tolerate filthy democrats stealing our democracy and conning their way into power. If they steal the election, we will take to the streets and declare a Clinton presidency illegitimate and illegal . We will stand behind the military men and women in uniform as the U.S. armed forces depose you and remove you from office , to announce new elections without the festering, cancerous stench of the DNC and the Clintons hanging over this nation like a putrid cloud of filth.We the People have had enough of you demons, you creatures from Hell, you walking bags of antihuman reptilian snakes who pretend to be leaders in Washington. Your days of tyranny and totalitarian domination are rapidly coming to an end. And you will soon face the informed justice of an enraged population that refuses to be enslaved by your incessant corruption and wretched government rackets.From Breitbart.com  Racketeering Former prosecutor Andrew McCarthy has recently observed that Hillary Clintons abuse of the State Department looks an awful lot like a racketeering enterprise, which could trigger the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1971, more widely known as RICO. McCarthy explainedUnder RICO, an enterprise can be any association of people, informal or formal, illegitimate or legitimate  it could be a Mafia family, an ostensibly charitable foundation, or a department of government. It is a racketeering enterprise if its affairs are conducted through a pattern of racketeering activity. A pattern means merely two or more violations of federal or state law these violations constitute racketeering activity if they are included among the extensive list of felonies laid out in the statute. Its time to defeat Clinton , followed by arresting all the Clinton operatives and initiating hundreds of federal prosecution cases against these Third World fraudsters. Thats how we take back America, restore democracy and regain public trust in law and order. NOTE TO THE FEDS Arrest the democrat criminals or lose any semblance of legal authority in America REMEMBER If federal authorities do not arrest and prosecute the Clintons and all their coconspirators, they essentially forfeit any real claim to legitimate legal authority. At that point, the citizens will realize they no longer have any logical obligation to pay federal taxes, obey federal laws, abide by federal regulations or consent to be governed by anybody in Washington at all.After all, a nation run by a system that refuses to hold its leaders accountable for their criminal conduct is a nation that can no longer claim to operate under the rule of law. At that point, justice becomes a sad, tragic joke against the citizens, and the nation soon finds itself on the verge of a mass citizens revolt. If the FBI wont seek criminal indictments against Hillary Clinton and her criminal cohorts, sooner or later the military or the citizens will do it for them .

"This smart, harmless pesticide patent could take down Monsanto and change the world Wednesday, November 02, 2016 by J. D. Heyes Tags mushrooms , Monsanto , pesticides NaturalNews Is bioagriculture giant Monsanto, king of genetically modified foods and seeds, about to suffer an irreversible decline while the planet Earth gets a huge chemical reprieveWell, it may be a bit too early to declare the St. Louisbased corporation dead in the water, but that day may soon be upon us, thanks to a nifty new pesticide patent that would make BioAg chemicals unnecessary.As reported by the website Anonymous , one man who has dedicated his life to the study of mushrooms may have just stumbled upon the one invention that will dramatically change the way we protect food crops from voracious pests.Paul Stamets has unearthed medical cure after cure, and he says the key to saving the planet can be found in the mushroom.Stamets, one of the worlds leading mycologists  if not the top researcher of fungi  filed a patent in 2001 that has since been all but ignored. Why Because most of his research has been viewed as hostile to conventional industries, including the pesticide industry. Anonymous notes that some executives of the pesticide industry have remarked that the patent he filed was the most disruptive they had ever seen. Kills pests naturally and with zero impact on the environment And indeed, a read of the patent reveals a remarkable claim.The present invention relates to the use of fungal mycelium as a biopesticide. More particularly, the invention relates to the control and destruction of insects, including carpenter ants, fire ants, termites, flies, beetles, cockroaches and other pests, using fungal mycelia as both attractant and infectious agent, the patent says.In other words, fungus that can be present on crops will both attract destructive pests and then infect and kill them after they have eaten it. In his patent, Stamets claims that more than one fungus can be used in combination, can be dried or freezedried, then packaged and reactivated for use as an effective bioinsecticide.No more chemicals. No more spraying. No more need for Monsantos chemicalfirst approach to growing our food.In his patent Stamets noted that the widespread use of chemical pesticides is a primary cause of a number of secondary environmental problems that occur besides the death of targeted pests. They include soil poisoning, the toxifying of underlying water tables and aquifers, as well as the pollution of surface water due to runoff.In addition, they lead to increases in cancer, allergies, neurological diseases, immune disorders Even the deaths of some agricultural workers and consumers have been linked to the use of chemical pesticides.Increasingly regulated and even banned in some countries, chemical pesticides like Monsantos Roundup, with the cancercausing primary ingredient glyphosate , have become so dangerous that many communities are scrambling for natural solutions to pest problems. Who knew mushrooms could be so lethal to pests This guy did Compounding these problems, many pest type or vermin insects have developed a broad spectrum of resistance to chemical pesticides, resulting in few commercially available pesticides that are effective without thorough and repeated applications, the patent says. In addition to being largely ineffective and difficult and costly to apply, chemical pesticides present the further disadvantage of detrimental effects on nontarget species, resulting in secondary pest outbreaks.But his invention, he wrote, offers the agriculture industry an environmentally benign alternative to insect control by working to attract insects that latent preconidial mycelium that is fresh, dried or freezedried, that later infects and kills the host.Infected insects will then carry the fungal hyphae back to the central colony, then disperse the fungal pathogen even further.In essence, he wrote, fungal mycelium is both a bait/attractant as well as a food insecticide, and all without harming one thing in the environment.Its a harmless pesticide that works without genetically modifying our food, poisoning our earth and filling humans with toxins. Using just mushrooms.Now  who will step up and market it You can bet it wont be Monsanto. Sources",junksci
"10 Reasons to drink lemon water on an empty stomach Wednesday, November 02, 2016 by Amy Goodrich Tags lemon water , detox , digestive health NaturalNews Fruitinfused water is extremely trendy right now. Celebrities such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Aniston, and Beyonce swear by lemon water first thing in the morning. There are even entire diets based on this fruit. According to some health advocates, drinking lemon water on an empty stomach takes you one step closer to optimal health.But does swapping your morning coffee for this fashionably healthy lifestyle choice offer any significant benefit Or is this just another health fad Lets take a closer look at ten incredible reasons why you should start your day with a glass of lemon water. 1. Nutrient powerhouse While low in calories, lemons are loaded with healthpromoting essential nutrients, including vitamin C, Bcomplex vitamins, calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, and fiber. 2. Boosts immune system Vitamin C plays a major role in our immune system, and lemons are loaded with it. A strong and healthy immune system will help you keep bacterial and viral infections at bay. 3. Digestion aid The citric acid in lemon interacts with enzymes and acids involved in digestion. It stimulates digestion and the secretion of gastric juice. Furthermore, lemon juice loosens toxins in the digestive tract and may help relieve symptoms of indigestion such as bloating, burping, and heartburn. 4. Detoxifies your body Every day, we are subjected to a wide variety of chemicals and toxins present in the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat. While our body has its own cleansing systems, it is a good idea to put less stress on your already overworked body and give these cleansing mechanisms a boost. Lemon juice stimulates the liver by enhancing its enzyme function, thus helping your body to flush out more waste materials and toxins . 5. Boosts heart and brain health Thanks to its high level of potassium, lemon juice aids in the proper functioning of the nervous system. Furthermore, it has been shown to lower blood pressure which is a major risk factor for a heart attack. 6. Promotes glowing skin Lemons are packed with antioxidants. These little free radical fighting substances help to decrease blemishes and wrinkles for a rejuvenated, radiant skin. When applied to the skin, lemons can also reduce the appearance of scar tissue and age spots. 7. Weight loss aid While lemon juice might not be a weight loss miracle on its own, its high levels of pectin fibers curb the appetite and will help you to eat less at main meals. 8. Fights inflammation Lemon water possesses strong antiinflammatory properties to soothe a sore throat or inflamed tonsils. Additionally, it removes uric acid from the joints, which is one of the main contributors to chronic pain and inflammation. 9. Boosts energy levels Lemons energize the body and fight feelings of depression and anxiety. So instead of having a coffee in the morning why not try a glass of lemon juice instead 10. Hydrates your body After a night of hard work, your body is dehydrated and in desperate need of water. Lemon juice provides your body with the muchneeded water and electrolytes potassium, calcium, and magnesium to rehydrate body tissue and flush out more toxins and waste materials.While lemon water seems to be the perfect drink to prevent or cure a myriad of our daily aches and pains, not all that glitters is gold. Lemon juice can be hard on teeth enamel. Therefore, its important to dilute it with water and rinse your mouth thoroughly with filtered water after drinking lemon juice.

"Email I lost track of my boy. Hes 4foot9, has brown hair, and is wearing a shirt with a lizard on it. These robot street performers have not been any help at all. 1. The weather was nice, so I took my son to the boardwalk to walk around and watch the street performers. We were in line to get pretzels when he ran off to chase after a pigeon, and I lost him in the crowd. I looked around the area and couldnt find him anywhere. So I ran up to one of those robot streetperformer guys that I know my son loves to watch and asked him if he had seen a small boy with a lizard shirt on. The guy turned to me and just started robotically dancing to Funkytown. No matter how much I implored him to stop dancing to Funkytown and tell me if hed seen my son, he refused to break character for even a goddamn second. This was extremely upsetting to me, but I didnt have time to dwell on it. I ran off in search of my son. 2. The next robot street performer I asked about my son was doing the thing where they pretend to be in off mode and wouldnt even look me in the eye as I begged him to help me find my little boy. But I was really starting to worry about my son, so I played along and threw a dollar in his tip bucket hoping that would make him turn on. But that didnt make him turn on. So I threw 5 in his bucket, and that didnt make him turn on either. Finally, I put a 20 in the bucket, and he whirred to life, blowing on his weird, whirling whistle thing. But he still wouldnt tell me if he had seen my son. He just kept blowing on that stupid fucking whistle of his. Thats all he did. Whistle and whistle and whistle. 3. At this point it had been 10 minutes or so since I lost track of my son, so I was officially in panic mode. I went up to yet another one of the boardwalks many robot street performers and asked him if he had seen my son. I even took out a picture of him to show the guy. He looked at the picture and studied it for a moment, and Im elated because, unlike the other ones, he actually seemed like he might help me. But then he took the picture of my son, put it in his mouth, and pretended to robotically print it out of his mouth like a ticket or something. So I grabbed the picture and started to walk away when the son of a bitch took me by the hand and offered me a metallic rose. This piece of shit was incorporating me into his whole goddamn act. And by the way, the crowd was loving it. They were eating it up. So I threw his stupid metallic rose on the ground and asked him again if hed seen my son. And he just started doing a robotic version of the beatingheart thing that mimes do. By then I was just crying because I was so worried about my son, and the motherfucker offered me a metallic handkerchief. A metallic fucking handkerchief. I swear to God. 4. When I went up to this robot street performer, he was smoking a cigarette and looking at his phone, clearly on a break. Finally, I thought. This man will help me find my son. But when I asked him if he had seen my boy, he actually went back into character and started smoking his cigarette all robotically. What a nightmare. 5. I really couldve used some comfort and assistance when I approached this robot street performer and asked him if he had seen my son. Instead, I got a dance battle between him, one of those tree guys, and a couple of statue men. All of them refused to acknowledge me, including the statue men who honestly shouldnt have even been dancing because their whole thing is supposed to be that theyre statues. But they did dance. And they were really good. The whole group was really good at dancing. And they wouldnt stop for a second to help a distraught mother find her child. Disgusting. 6. As soon as I asked this robot performer if he had seen my son anywhere, he pointed his robot finger at a little boy in the front row. I told him that was not my son and described him to the guy. The guy then pointed at the boy again. Again, I told him this was not my child. He then started robot dancing around the boy, pointing to him over and over and over again. The boy was loving the attention, but I was infuriated. Fed up with the robot street performers, I turned to the little boy and asked him if he had seen a little boy about his age running around here on his own. The little boy looked up at me, considering the question. Then one of these robot streetperformer fucking shitwads showed up with a boombox blasting Funkytown, and suddenly everyone was dancing to Funkytown, including this little boy. Thats when I gave up hope of finding out if any of the robot street performers had seen my son. Daniel, if youre reading this, Im by the bike rental. Please come find me.",satire
"Email Whether or not youre a basketball fan, youre going to love this story about a bold new humanitarian initiative from the NBA. In order to help alleviate the refugee crisis in Europe, the league is housing Syrian refugees on whichever half of the court isnt being played on during the game. Now thats making a difference. Way to go, NBA Since the Syrian civil war began in 2011, millions of Syrians have been displaced. But thanks to the generosity of the NBA, some of them will now find a new home right around the threepoint line on the half of the court that isnt being played on at that time. While players occupy one half of the court, Syrian refugees will have a safe and welcoming space on the other half to reassemble their lives until the ball changes possession and they are shuttled to the opposite end. Wow. What a beautiful gesture from the NBA With 29 courts across the country and 82 games in the 20162017 season, the league is set to provide housing that periodically oscillates from one half of the court to the other for several thousand Syrian refugees. This is huge. In contrast to Europes notoriously overcrowded refugee camps, the NBAs half courts are big enough to comfortably house at least five families around the perimeter and one or two in the paint. The refugees also have access to any snack vendors who happen to be milling about the crowd near whichever half of the court theyre on at the time. Of course, its a new program, and its not perfect. There have been several incidents in which refugees have collided with players after failing to get to the other half of the court in time, and last night an 8yearold Syrian girl had to be treated for minor injuries after LeBron James dunked on her during a fast break. Still, according to NBA commissioner Adam Silver, the program is a huge step up from the refugee camps abroad. The Syrian refugee crisis is only getting worse. Meanwhile, weve got this half of the court that isnt being played on just collecting dust waiting to be put to good use, said Silver, adding that he felt the league had a moral responsibility to harbor the refugees. If we can help these people by sheltering them on one side of the court until theres a change in possession and then sheltering them on the other half as soon as theres a change in possession and then sheltering them on the other half until theres a change in possession, then we have an obligation to do that. Its refreshing to see a major organization like the NBA reaching out to a group of people who so desperately need our help right now. Faith in humanity restored",satire
"Email In an age where information can be spread to millions of people within seconds, its often difficult to separate fact from fiction. That was certainly the case a few months ago when a controversial photo of President Obama began to circulate online, with many insisting that the image was the real, unedited deal. But today that picture was officially debunked The photo of Obama with a speech balloon saying Islam is my main thing has been proven to be doctored. Wow. This is a good reminder to take everything you see on the internet with a grain of salt Take a look at the photo in question above. In it, you can clearly see Obama proudly declaring his unshakeable Islamic faith. At first glance, the photo looks like pretty clear evidence that Obama may be Muslim and confirms the suspicions of his most farright critics, who insist the president has been dishonest with the public about his true religious beliefs. But when the image went viral on Twitter, one user pointed out a possible sign of doctoring Many users agreed that the photo appeared to have been manipulated in some way and asked for an expert to weigh in. A graphic designer named Brendan McCann, whose Twitter bio says hes been in the industry for over a decade, quickly answered the call. But it was Snopes that officially put the matter to rest. After scouring the internet far and wide, they were able to dig up the original version of the photograph, taken during one of the presidents official White House photo ops, and theres no speech balloon upholding the teachings of the Quran anywhere in sight. Take a look at the two images side by side to see how the effect was achieved Well, there you have it. It looks like whoever made this image took some of the space from above the presidents head and used it to overlay the speech balloon on top. Its a powerful effect, but its definitely not real. Remember When it comes to the internet, always question your sources ",satire

"Apple is very cruel to taunt me about driving into a pool. I was already deeply embarrassed, and these new iPhone emojis are just salt in the wound. 1. My Car Falling Into The Pool The swimming pool near my house closes after the summer, so I decided to have one last splash in late September. It was a little cold to go swimming, but I didnt want to miss out on the fun of the pool. Despite the chilly weather, I had a great experience, at least until it was time to head to my car and drive home. Leaving the parking space, I accidentally went backwards and drove my Honda right through a chainlink fence and into the pool. I cant excuse this dumb mistake, but in my defense I was still soaking wet and shivering, and that distracted me from driving. When Apple released this emoji of my car going into the pool, I was mostly curious why they had singled my situation out for an update, but I have to admit I kind of deserved it. 2. Me In My Flooding Car I have always been a loyal customer of Apples technology products, which makes this second emoji feel like a betrayal. The first emoji of my car falling into the pool was perhaps deserved, because I was extremely clumsy and foolish, but a second emoji at my expense was completely uncalledfor. Worst of all, this emoji has now been embraced by teens to represent bad sex, and they tweet messages like my Tinder date went well but EMOJI FML. I am uncomfortable having my face seen by millions of people in this context. 3. The Lifeguard Calling Me A Dunce I am furious with this emoji because it is inaccurate as well as cruel. Unlike Apple, the lifeguard was nothing but polite as he helped me crawl out of my underwater cars window, and at no point did he call me a dunce. The lifeguard did ask, What the hell happened and I could tell he thought I was dumb, but he did not say the word dunce or any other insult. Not even once. If Apple wants to taunt me with their emojis, they can at least depict things as they actually occurred. 4. The Words Wet Idiot Beneath Me As I Swim Out Of The Pool Doesnt Apple know I already feel bad enough about swimming across a pool in my street clothes All the other swimmers had already evacuated the pool and were watching me with judgmental eyes as I flailed through the water in jeans and a polo Tshirt. My sneakers got completely soaked and still smell mildewy weeks after drying out. This humiliation is only mitigated by the fact that the wetidiot emoji is now extremely popular among iPhone users in China, and millions of Chinese people use it in text messages to represent amazing sex. But still, I wish Apple had elected not to release any of these. 5. Me On The Bicycle I Must Ride Now That My Car Is Ruined Under normal circumstances, I would be thrilled and honored to have Apple turn my bicycle into an emoji. However, given the timing, it seems like Apple is poking fun at the fact that now this bicycle is my only mode of transportation. Perhaps losing a car to a swimming pool isnt a big deal to a rich company like Apple, but to normal folks like me, a Honda is a major investment and I cannot afford to replace it at this time. What stings worst of all is that I find this emoji very handy, and I frequently text it to people to tell them Im on my way. Unfortunately, despite Apples cruel mission to shame me, I find my iPhone too useful to stop using.",satire
"Email With Election Day fast approaching, citizens everywhere are bracing themselves for an uncertain future. Fortunately, no matter what happens, theres at least one truth that voters from both sides can hang their hats on Political scientists have confirmed that the outcome of the presidential election will in no way affect ketchup. Whew What a tremendous relief Trump or Clinton, whoever takes the office in November, ketchup will still be red, salty, and sweet, according to leading experts. Despite a range of conflicting policies listed on the candidates websites, they are in full agreement about ketchup, a substance neither candidate plans to change in any way. Americans can be certain that a vote cast on November 8 is a vote that in no way alters the familiar appearance, flavor, or viscosity of ketchup. Ketchup fans rejoice Whether 2017 marks the beginning of higher taxes for highincome households per Clintons plan or tax cuts across all income brackets per Trumps, ketchup will remain exactly the same condiment its always been. Regardless of how the next four years change U.S. immigration policy, and no matter whether they see the passage of the DREAM Act or the construction of a border wall, ketchup will abide by the same recipe and will be available in the same variety of packaging. If you had any doubts about the future of ketchup, it looks like you can breathe easy. No doubt, the outcome of one of the most divisive elections in history will bring about certain changes, but there will be none for ketchup. If you love ketchup the way it is, then its already time to celebrate.",satire

Aliens I never heard of nothing like that before, but I can practically see those legs kicking, so nice and so big The cab begins to swerve as the cabbie becomes more excited about how big the aliens legs were and is no longer paying any attention to the road. Im telling the truth The legs were big Wait, I just remembered The legs were small Yes, those big alien legs the cabbie shrieks as he completely loses control of the vehicle, which goes careering up a nearby volcano. His last words as the taxi plummets over the verge and into molten lava are, I believe you Someone believed that you were abducted by aliens, but at what cost At the cost of dying in a volcano. Start Over Here we are Sisters apartment says the cabbie. Great. How much do I owe you Leave without paying. This ones on the house says the cabbie.

Send your sister nine emails about the fact that you are outside and have seen aliens. Text your sister the alien emoji, the abduction emoji, and the outside apartment emoji. Your sister answers the door immediately. She invites you to sit down on the couch and hands you a microphone with the local news channels logo cube on it and asks you to tell her what happened. I was abducted by aliens, and I am going to tell you all about it. Stand back, my sibling. I am going to convince you that I was abducted by aliens. Aliens, eh your sister asks. Abducted by Yes, my sister, they stole me from the atmosphere, and now Im back. Precisely. Now listen up, my sibling. Here comes the tale. Go ahead then, says your sister. Tell me a story about how aliens stole you from the atmosphere. It began like any other night It began right away with aliens It began right after the aliens had left me in the forest and disappeared You begin your story The alien light dissipated. I was alone in the forest at night. I decided to hail a cab, so I stuck out my arm in the universal sign for taxi. Immediately, a cab burst from the forest. Where you headed the cab driver asked. I got in and told him to go to my sisters house. The cabbie got out of the cab. It was then I remember the cabbie got out of his cab. Then he got back in the cab. And thats all I remember. So, says your sister. If I have your story right, you hailed a cab in the forest, and at some point the driver got out of the vehicle, and thats all you remember. Exactly. Theres more to the story. Let me start over. The next thing I knew, he was back in the cab. Where you headed he asked me again. I told him to go to my sisters house. He got out of the cab again. I believe you about the driver getting out of the car, but I dont think you saw any aliens, says your sister. Im sorry, but thats just how I feel. Your sister doesnt believe that you were abducted by aliens. You have failed. Start Over The cabbie floored it, and pretty soon we were driving through the city on the way to my sisters house, which is where you live. We arrived, and I thanked the cabbie for his service. When we arrived, I got out of the cab. The cabbie and I pointed at each other and waved goodbye in silence for three minutes. And thats the end of my story. Well, it certainly sounds like you took a taxi from the forest to my apartment, but Im sorry to say Im not convinced that you saw any aliens, says your sister. Is that really the whole story Yes, thats it. There was more. Then I dont believe you saw any aliens. Ouch. You really bungled the story about how you were abducted by aliens. You are a miserable bard of the supernatural, and your sister didnt believe you at all. You have failed. Start Over Your sister settles in as you begin your alien testimony It began like any other night. I thought it was Guy Fawkes Night, so I was in the forest setting off fireworks by myself. I would light the firework, run back to safety, look up, and  Boom Good riddance, Sir Fawkes It was so much fun, I decided to light another firework. I wasnt having fun, but I decided to light another firework. I lit the firework, stepped back, and looked up. I expected to see a sparkling skyrocket. What I saw was A sparkling skyrocket, just as I had expected. A strange light in the sky. Yes, it was a skyrocket. My expectation was on the money. I prepared to launch another firework into the sky. I loaded it up, sprinted back to safety, and looked to the sky again, this time expecting to see the gorgeous blue and purple firework known as the Butchers Delight And the Butchers Delight it was. And thats when it happened. I was right again. In the clear sky above me, I saw the firework called the Butchers Delight. I set up the last firework, drew a match, and lit the fuse. It was a quick fuse, so the firework had already launched by the time I turned around and looked up, thinking I would see the unmistakeable multicolored burst of the Salute to James Buchanan firework. But is that what I saw, looking to the skies Yes, it was. It was not, for that was when it happened. Yes, my sibling. The Salute to James Buchanan firework exploded as planned. I applauded at the fireworks finale, congratulating myself on another successful night of fireworks even as I realized that I had bungled the Guy Fawkes date again. Then I went home. Then I came right to you. Thank you, says your sister. That was a very nice story about how you set off fireworks in the woods by yourself. And did you see any aliens while you were at it Yes. No. Well, I dont believe you. You only told me about fireworks. I was expecting to hear more about aliens. You have not convinced your sister that you saw aliens. Wait, I didnt tell it right. Start Over Okay, says your sister. Its too bad nothing happened with aliens. You have not convinced her that you were abducted by aliens. Wait, I didnt tell it right. Start Over A strange light appeared in the sky. I ran, but the strange light followed me. I couldnt escape it. There was a sudden burst of futuristic light. Science enveloped me. The light only got more futuristic. Then all of a sudden, I was standing on the UFO deck. When the light faded, I noticed that I was on a spaceship. This part of the ship was clean and triangular. I noticed that the spaceship had some sort of artificial gravity. I could tell immediately that the spaceship was in space. Okay, I think I understand that you were on a spaceship, says your sister. Get to the aliens, though. How about some aliens in the story When you were on the spaceship, were there any aliens that you saw Yes. I dont know, but my boss from my first job was there. My boss from my first job was there, and he was happy to see me. My boss said that I was dreaming, and I said Yes, that seems right. My boss said that I was dreaming, and I said, No, thats wrong, but it later turned out that he was right. Hmm, says your sister. It sounds to me like instead of encountering aliens, you had a dream about seeing your boss in space. Could that be right Yeah, thats definitely right. Wait, I told the story wrong. Let me start over. You were trying to get your sister to believe that you had seen aliens, but all you managed to convince her of was that you had a dream about seeing your boss in space. You failed Start Over There were aliens. A crowd of them. Huge, mighty creatures with skin like leather, hollow black eyes, and fearsome ivory fangs. The aliens were shouting at me, but I couldnt understand what they were saying. JENCH CREV AMAMU the aliens shouted, but I could not understand. From among the aliens, a bigger alien stepped forth. I immediately realized this was their mayor of the aliens, as the alien was wearing a ceremonial mayoral jacket. The mayor took out a device. The mayor reached out and put the device over my eyes. Suddenly, I could hear everything differently. The mayor then seemed to speak to me in English. Welcome to my UFO, said the mayor. You are now wearing language glasses. They allow you to understand anything that we say in our language, but be careful It doesnt work the other way around. If you want to learn how to talk like us, youll need to visit the Language Room and earn a diploma from the language guide. I told the mayor that I understood. I told the mayor that I didnt understand. I asked the mayor to explain who the aliens were and what their purpose was. I dont know what youre saying, but Im going to assume you asked who we are and what our purpose is. To do that, I will need to tell you how the world works. In the universe, there are three kinds of things. First, there is us. We are called people. You can tell were people by inspecting our beautiful ivory fangs and big, thick legs. Its obvious. Second, there is God. God is special, secret, and far away, and there is only one of him. And we need to find him so that we can hold hands forever. We dont know where God is, but we are looking for him. Last, there is rocks. Rocks is everything else. Planets are rocks. Spaceships are rocks. Since you are not a person, you are probably also a rockunless of course you are God. But thats very unlikely and illegal. I asked the mayor how to find out if I am a rock or if I am God. I still cant understand you, but heres the deal. Im going to retreat to the observation deck and look at the majesty of space for a while. Go to the Language Room, learn our language, then come find me and well see if we can find a use for you. The mayor left, and I was alone with the crowd of aliens. In the spaceships deck, the crowd of aliens was talking excitedly about God and about the kinds of dances they would do together when they found him at last. I left the deck area and went south into the hallway. In the Language Room, a man was standing on a small, circular stage. Above him hung a giant banner that read LANGUAGE TUTORIAL FOR ENGLISH SPEAKERS. He began the tutorial. Welcome to this free alienlanguage tutorial for English speakers said the man. If you are viewing this in hologram form, it means our captors have determined I am no longer necessary, and that they have mercifully killed me and freed me from my didactic prison. Right on I waved my hand through him to confirm that he was a hologram. I continued watching the presentation. He was not a hologram. Ha Not yet I wish he said. Please sit down, and lets get this presentation over with I sat back down and kept watching the presentation. Lets begin with the most basic grammatical element of the language the word CREV, the man began. He gestured in the air beside him, where the word CREV appeared in red light. CREV is a verb that roughly translates as to be about to point at something. If you want to communicate effectively with the aliens, its an extremely important word to know. CREV, I managed to say. CREB, I blurted stupidly. For example, to announce that I am ready to point at something, I would begin with the word AMAMU, which means me, then I would say, CREV, then I would say what I am pointing at. Like this AMAMU CREV MERYL STREEP. I looked where the man was pointing. I knew then that the man was pointing at Meryl Streep. Hello said Meryl Streep. I am definitely a hologram. AMAMU CREV MERYL STREEP, I said as I pointed at the Meryl Streep hologram. Very good. The next word were going to learn is important, but be aware that it is very politically charged. I am of course talking about the controversial word CREVV, and you must be very careful with it. Its a slur that means bad alien and is extremely insulting to use in any situation but language tutorials. CREVV, I said. I nodded solemnly. I asked the teacher for an example of the bad word in context. Here is an example of CREVV used in English context Oh God. The aliens are killing me. Why did I say CREVV Why didnt someone teach me not to say CREVV I shouldnt have said CREVV. I said, Okay. I said nothing. CREVV, I said. No sooner had the word left my lips than a fearsome ivory fang had pierced my vulnerable stomach and sent everything inside me all over the place. I was dead. You wrap your story about the aliens Ah. Soyou died your sister asks. Yeah. Wait, I didnt tell the story right. Let me start over. Hmmm. Idoubt it, says your sister. You told a story about how you got abducted by aliens and died, but your sister doesnt seem convinced. No one believed you You failed. Wait, I didnt tell the story right. Start Over At this point, youre almost conversant in the language. You just have a couple more words to get through. I am now teaching you the word JENCH. It means God. I said, JENCH. Finally, The word BRIDE is the equivalent of the English word um. When you say the word BRIDE, it means that you have forgotten how to speak, and you are trying to remember. I said, BRIDE. This concludes this first and only module of alien language for English beginners. Thank you for learning with me. Get out there, start speaking the language, and remember If Im not already dead, please find someone who will kill me With that, the teacher handed me a diploma with some inscrutable symbols on it and ushered me out of the Language Room. I left the Language Room and went back out to the ship hallway. I went east. I was in the ship corridor to the south of the first room. I went north.",satire

Is it ghosts and ghouls Or zombie apocalypse Or maybe your party is the fourth one of the night for your friends, and they dont want to spend money on multiple costumes. In that case, maybe a theme isnt the way to go. Just ask around, and youll be good to go 2. Fire up some spooky music Nothing sets the mood like some classic Monster Mash.

"Email Lets make sure to keep this a conversation about my photography skills, not a debate on whether or not weve been visited by aliens. 1. So really all Im looking for, feedbackwise, is if Im grasping the fundamentals of photography on this one. Can we ignore that theres clearly a UFO of some sort in the sky I didnt know it was there, and it wasnt supposed to be in the picture. I already know the spaceship is there its not constructive for you to tell me again. Do all the lines in the photo draw your eye to the middle Is there clear depth with the mountains in the distance Any advice would be great, and again, please ignore the apparent spaceship that, again, was not supposed to be in this photo. 2. In this image, I was trying to frame it correctly for twopoint perspective. I think you can pretty much tell that the barn has two vanishing points, and in my opinion, this is pretty good for a newbie. Id definitely like some tips for the future, though, to make an image like this more interesting to look at other than the fact that theres what appears to be an intergalactic vessel in the sky above it. 3. I dont know where the lights in this photo came from, so whether or not they are earthly is completely irrelevant. Personally, I think my camera was just malfunctioning, since I certainly dont remember them being present while I was taking this and night photography can be strange with such long exposures, so things can get weird. Okay, now that weve discussed the elephant in the room, lets talk about symmetry in this image since thats what I was going for. Any thoughts 4. If one more person tells me that Ive taken the most important photo in human history and doesnt have any input on if there is too much headroom above the mountains or if I used a long enough lens, I am going to scream. 5. Okay, I admit that the UFO is what really drew me into composing this image. That being said, lets talk about how it fits into the photograph, not the fact that I actually captured it. Is it a good picture Possibly. Did I use the rule of thirds successfully I sure hope so.

"7 Incredible Animal Mating Rituals Posted today Email You know the birds and the bees. What about the rest Here are seven mating rituals that showcase nature in all its complexity and beauty. Orangutans Orangutans are among a special group of animals with mating rituals based around the lunar cycle, meaning that whenever a full moon is in the sky, male orangutans will climb the tallest tree and try to have sex with the moon, only settling for a female orangutan once they grow tired of stretching their penises outward so they might touch the moon with it. Armadillos In the Armadillos song, the male armadillos penis makes an annoying highpitched whirring sound until a female armadillo is so annoyed by it that she silences it by having sex with him. Alligators During mating season, male alligators stand upright and walk around on their hind legs and place their arms on their hips and sometimes even ride bikes until a female alligator gets horny from watching them. Beavers The male beaver and female beaver each recite a fun fact about beavers, taking a step closer to one another as they do so. At some point, they get so close that theyre actually mating. Elephants Before having sex, the female elephant will coat her male partner in sticky, boiling hot Pepsi that only comes out of her trunk when shes in the mood. Iguanas When it is time for iguanas to mate, the male iguana climbs on top of a female fox and the female iguana climbs on top of a male fox. The two iguanas ride their foxes straight at each other at full speed, and when the foxes collide with each other, the iguanas are flung forward and collide in midair. As they fly through the air, the male iguana impregnates the female iguana, who sprays eggs in all directions as she hurtles haphazardly toward the sky. When the mating ritual is complete, both iguanas hit the ground and die. Bonobos The male bonobo spends a full year trying to work up the courage to ask for a kiss. If he is rejected or the kiss isnt that good, he will crawl up a tree and scream at God for giving him such good lips for kissing but no one to share them with.",satire
"Email If you want to see the full depths of human greed, look no further than the city of Chicago. This week, the residents of this selfish city are marching through the streets rooting for their hometown baseball team, the Chicago Cubs, to win the World Series. Yep, you heard that right. The citizens of Chicago want their baseball team to win the World Series even though their city already has a bunch of movie theaters and a zoo. Some people just want more and more and more. The endless selfishness on display here is just sickening. Apparently having dozens of movie theaters and a whole zoo to enjoy isnt enough for the pleasure gluttons of Chicago. They need a big honking World Series victory, too. Well give you a minute to try to wrap your head around the sheer unbridled avarice of these people. All you have to do is Google Movie Theaters Chicago, and youll be flooded with the names and addresses of cinemas all over the city playing both mainstream blockbusters and art house gems, which the people of Chicago can go to whenever they want. And when they arent in the mood for a movie, these spoiled brats can go see exotic creatures from all over the world at the Lincoln Park Zoo. But apparently thats not enough to satisfy these unhinged hedonists. No, they need a gigantic parade for the Chicago Cubs cutting right through the middle of their city. They need fountains of champagne and a picture of Anthony Rizzo celebrating on the front page of every major newspaper in the country. Hey, Chicago Maybe if the Cubs win the World Series someone will make a movie about it, and you can go watch it in whichever one of the goddamn dozens of fucking movie theaters in your charmed little city is closest to your house. And then when the movie about your world champion baseball team is over, you can go talk about it while you look at the majestic lowland gorillas that live at your fully functioning goddamn zoo. If you arent sickened by what you see in the mirror, Chicago, its because greed has warped your minds. Some people are just never content, no matter how many blessings life serves to them on a silver platter. Apparently the people in Chicago will not be satisfied unless their brains are gushing dopamine in all directions at all times. They have so many movie theaters. They have a zoo. And yet they wont be happy until the fucking president of the United States is personally congratulating them for having the best baseball team in the world. Where do they get the gall to desire a World Series victory amid their cornucopia of movie theaters and their zoo Its disgusting. Nothing is ever enough for Chicago. Fucking ingrates.",satire

"Email Since Donald Trump entered the election over a year ago, he has singlehandedly destroyed the GOP, leaving both the House and the Senate in utter disarray. But although many political strategists believe permanent damage has been done, conservatives shouldnt lose hope yet, because Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has just emerged fully nude from an ayahuasca tent with visions of a new Republican Party. A fresh GOP platform requires fresh leadership, and when Speaker Ryan journeyed to South America last week to embark on an immersive psychedelic vision quest of political rebirth, he just proved hes the only one for the job. After traveling to Peru and entering a makeshift tent with nothing but a towel, 200 mg of DMT, and a bucket to vomit in, Paul Ryan RWis. spent the last 12 hours lying nude on the jungle floor, enduring bursts of vivid consciousness in which he watched the secrets of a unified, more moderate GOP unfold before his very eyes. While under the influence of the powerful psychedelic, ancient spiritual guides appeared before the congressman, instructed him to remove his clothes, and held him down as lifelike projections of Republican leaders twisted and contorted around him until the perfect cabinet had revealed itself amid infinite realities in which tax cuts and fiscal budgets exploded into cacophonous symphonies, all to create a Republican Party that mobilizes key voter constituencies. Check out these tweets he posted just a few moments after emerging nude from his tent in the Amazon rain forest Whoa. Democrats have been pretty confident this past year, but if Paul Ryans visions of the Republican party are right, they better watch out Say what you want about Paul Ryan, but hes a man who refuses to give up. On the one hand, is it possible that the speakers grand ayahuasca visions of a new Republican Party are just a temporary fix Sure. But on the other hand, if he plays his cards right, his proposals could have an even larger impact than they did during the thousands of years he lived while trapped inside his own mind.

"Email Last night the Chicago Cubs eked out a thrilling game 7 victory in the World Series against the Cleveland Indians and ended a championship drought that had lasted for 108 years. This is a historic moment to be sure, but there will be no smiling and cheering in Chicago Fans of the Cubs are still too sad over the death of Princess Diana to do any celebrating. I honestly never thought Id see the Cubs bring home the trophy, but everyone here is still too swept up with grief over Lady Di to really enjoy themselves right now, said Cubbies superfan Raymon Lindley, who was among the thousands of fans who gathered outside Wrigley Field following last nights edgeofyourseat game to light candles in memory of the late Princess Of Wales. It would be macabre to celebrate the win in light of what happened to Princess Diana on that fateful August night in 1997. Theo Epstein, the cursebreaking president of baseball operations for the Cubs, has shipped the World Series trophy overseas to Britain, where it is to be laid on the grave of the Peoples Princess. While the people of Chicago are undoubtedly proud of their Cubs, no parade has been planned, as the general feeling of the city is that it would be too gratuitous at this time. I just called my 91yearold grandfather, who waited his whole life to see the Cubs win the World Series, said longtime seasonticket holder Karen Hunter. We spent the entire call crying about Princess Diana together. She was so young. I would give a thousand Cubs World Series wins if Lady Di could be alive for one more day, Hunter added. History has been made, and the Cubs finally have their muchsoughtafter championship, but fans clearly still have a long way to go before theyre comfortable celebrating the historic achievement. Aside from the occasional outburst of Candle In The Wind by groups of bereft fans, Wrigleyville will remain a quiet and mournful place until the Cubs faithful are ready to party with their victorious hometown heroes. And its anyones guess as to when that will be.",satire

Fortunately, one of the biggest producers of bottled water is taking some real action to go green Poland Spring is fighting the accumulation of plastic waste with a new campaign that highlights how terrible their bottled water tastes. Now here is a company that gets it. We just want to get the word out that our crystalclear water tastes truly awful, said Janet Connor, senior VP of marketing for Poland Spring. Every year, 38 billion plastic water bottles are thrown out. In order to minimize the impact we have on the environment, we wanted to remind people that drinking our fresh spring water is an unpleasant ordeal from the first sip to the last. Given the option, it would be a better idea to drink hot wolf piss. As part of the campaign, Poland Spring is marshaling their full resources behind the effort, including print and billboard placements that advertise their water as a miserable experience for your mouth. To support these efforts, social campaigns using the hashtag #MyPolandSpringTastesLike will encourage users to share the first time they tried the companys bottled water, and to pull no punches when it comes to describing the excruciating flavor. Poland Spring has even updated its website to reflect their new focus Wow What a huge win for the environment Its nice to see that the folks at Poland Spring are willing to describe their product as Satans vomit if it means making this planet a better place.

Phrase your request carefully Its absolutely imperative that when you ask the man who currently has his hand on your knee for a raise, you are respectful and conscious. Nail down every word in your request beforehand, so that when the time comes, the man with his hand on your knee is inspired, but not threatened. 2. Anticipate your talking points Ask yourself Is your employer dataconscious Is your parent company in a good financial position to give out raises right now Are five sweaty fingers simply resting on your knee, or are they moving around, toying playfully with the fabric on your pants As youre sitting across from the man controlling those fingers, make sure youre constantly asking yourself these types of questions, because if you do, youre guaranteed to step up your negotiation skills tenfold 3. Assume a stance that is confident but also gently pushes his hand off your knee Whether youre crossing your legs to subtly shake his hand off your knee or swiveling your chair to guide his palm onto the armrest of your chair, try to use your body to signal confidence, rather than looking fidgety. After all, visual cues are just as important as verbal ones. So when you sit down in his office and notice the hand on your leg or rubbing your upper arm, look like the valuable employee you truly know you are 4. Make sure to ask for an exact salary before the mans fingers start moving up your leg It might seem daunting at first to directly ask for money, but if you dont come with an exact number in mind, the man with his hand on your knee will end up confused, with little direction information about how much of a bump to give you. Calculate an appropriate new salary so you can bargain, but when you do, avoid mentioning the salaries of any other coworkers whose legs he has also touched, because this is about you, not them 5. Dont mention the hand A real negotiator stays on target and doesnt let daytoday work conversations creep into business.

"Email Yoda is a sick, elderly reptile who lives alone at a motel in a swamp. Hes an absolute mess, and hes incapable of looking after himself. Do you think you have what it takes to be his livein caretaker 1. Before we get started, you need to understand that this is not a glamorous job. Yoda is miserable to be around, he needs constant supervision, and his hygiene is appalling. Caring for him is an aroundtheclock gig, and it requires an extraordinary level of patience and compassion. Youre going to have to put up with a lot of bullshit. Thats okay. Im confident I can handle whatever challenges the job throws my way. Wow, that sounds pretty difficult. I suppose Id just have to try my best and hope I do a good job. Honestly, I dont really have any experience with anything like this. I already know that I would do a terrible job. 2. One of the most important aspects of the job is tending to Yodas skincare needs. His skin is dry, flaky, and covered in sores, and it needs to be rubbed down several times a day with a special prescription lotion. Unfortunately, Yoda hates being touched, and he wont let you put the lotion on without a fight. Sometimes hell spray you with his stink gland or try to bite you. Other times hell scurry underneath the couch and try to dig a hole in the floor to hide in, frantically scratching at the carpet until his hooves are bloody and raw. With this in mind, how would you go about getting him to cooperate with you for his skin treatments Using simple terms he can understand, Id explain to him why the skin treatments are necessary, and Id work with him to figure out what, exactly, he doesnt enjoy about them and then use that information to tailor the process for him so that its as painless and comfortable as possible. I would trap him underneath a laundry basket until he burns off all his combative energy. Then, once hes tuckered out, I would pin him to the floor with my knee and apply the lotion to his skin as quickly as possible before he gets a second wind. Id spread a thin layer of the lotion around the inside of a garbage bag. Then, Id roll a tennis ball past Yoda to create a distraction, and while his attention is diverted, I would run over and stuff him inside the garbage bag. Id shake him up and down inside the bag until his body was covered in lotion, and then I would dump him out on a mat of paper towels to clean off any excess lotion. I would really rather not touch his gross skin, so Id probably just leave the lotion out on the counter for him. 3. Yoda always makes a huge fuss about eating his fruits and vegetables, and if he had his way, he would live entirely off of Slim Jims. How would you ensure that hes eating a healthy, nutritious diet and not just Slim Jims I would make him healthy vegetarian Slim Jims out of ground mushrooms, spices, lentils, and other wholesome ingredientshe wouldnt be able to tell the difference I would dip all of his Slim Jims in nail polish remover to make them taste horrible, leaving him no choice but to eat the vegetables if he doesnt want to go hungry. I would tell him that his nemesis Count Dooku is coming to spay him, and the only way for him to get strong enough to fight back is if he fills himself up on powerful vitamins and minerals, like the ones found in fruits and vegetables. I would mash the fruits and vegetables into a paste and force the paste down his throat with my fingers. 4. Yoda spends hours each morning tending to a patch of weeds out back that he refers to as his crops. Its pretty harmlesshe mostly just sprays the hose and drags a rake around a bitbut if you dont keep an eye on him, hell sneak away and try to find the Chosen One. Thats what he calls the trasheating swamp pelican that lives in the pond behind the house. Its unclear why he thinks this pelican is so special, but hes already given it his lightsaber and all of his money in an effort to help it defeat the dark side. This is all nonsense, of course, and its important to make sure Yoda doesnt give any more of his valuables to this bird. What measures would you take to keep Yoda away from the Chosen One I would tether him to the house with a length of rope thats long enough for him to freely tend to his crops but too short for him to wander off to places he shouldnt be. I would dress Yoda in a vest covered in flashing lights and bells, which would scare the pelican away should it ever try to approach. Shock collar. I would shoot the pelican with a gun and then make Yoda eat its disgusting meat so that he realizes that the bird isnt special. 5. Theres nothing in the world that Yoda enjoys more than watching pornography. However, doing so gets him extremely riled up, and his doctor has warned that his heart is no longer strong enough to handle excitement like this. Nonetheless, Yoda will still try to watch porn any chance he gets, and the only way to curb this habit is to reprimand him when he does. How would you reprimand Yoda for watching porn I would revoke his TV and computer privileges for the rest of the day and have him use his time to do something constructive instead. I would put an oven mitt over his head and ducttape it in place so hed be physically incapable of looking at pornor anything else, for that matter. I would leave the oven mitt over his head for an entire day. I would strip off all his clothes and parade him around town so that he could see how it feels to have strangers stare at him when hes naked. I would charge people 5 to take pictures with naked Yoda, and I would spend all the money on something he hates. I would put him in the oven and pretend like I was going to cremate him, and I would only take him out if he promised to never look at porn again. 6. One thing to be aware of is that Yoda is very afraid of airplanes. If he hears a commercial jet flying overhead, hell freak out and try to use the Force to make it crash. Granted, hes probably not strong enough anymore to actually cause any harm, but just be aware that thats a thing he might do. Got it. Ill make sure he doesnt try to down any airplanes. If Yoda wants to make an airplane crash, who am I to stop him 7. Yoda has no family or friends, but he does have a catfish named ObiWan that he keeps in a cigar box next to his bed. He talks quietly to the catfish for several hours each night, but what he doesnt realize is that the catfish is dead. Yodas doctor is concerned that hes formed an unhealthy attachment to the catfish, and he has strongly suggested taking the catfish away from him before he becomes any more emotionally invested in it. How would you go about taking Yodas catfish away from him while also minimizing the emotional devastation that will result from losing his treasured companion I would get Yoda a fishbowl and his very own pet goldfish. Once he has a real, live fish to take care of, I trust hell begin losing interest in ObiWan, and I will then gradually start weaning the dead fish out of his life. While Yoda is sleeping, I would secretly put a small speaker inside of ObiWans belly and wirelessly connect it to a microphone that I could use to make the dead catfish talk. Then, the following day when Yoda is having his alone time with ObiWan, I would have the catfish say, Yoda, if you truly care about me, please flush me down the toilet so I can go live with my family in the sewer. Hopefully he would feel comfortable parting with his companion if he thought it was what the dead catfish wanted. I would tell Yoda that Count Dooku is coming to make ObiWan into a delicious po boy sandwich, and the only way for him to thwart his nemesis is to run outside and toss ObiWan into the swamp pond so he can swim away to safety. I would throw ObiWan in the trash and then lock Yoda in a cupboard until he stops crying.

"I know all of these meats. 1.This slab of bacon has felt the warmth of my hands and the beauty of my gaze. 2. I can remember the moment as if it happened only an hour ago. I was young, having just been asked to leave the seminary after I repeatedly refused to chip in for WiFi, and walking through downtown Kansas City when I came across this sirloin steak. Never before had I seen something so special. I took the meat up into my hands and eyed it for a solid three minutes before I set it back down on a manhole cover and continued on my way. A chance meeting, sure. But an unforgettable one. 3. Ive seen and held raw meat, as well This pork chop, while raw, is still deserving of human touch, and I provided that comfort for it. Anyone would have done the same. 4. When you win a oneday, twonights cruise to Stamford, CT on a radio call in sweepstakes, you think you have it made. But I was a bit nervous when I took this succulent rack of St. Louis ribs onboard with me. It was my very first cruise, and I didnt know what to expect. But lets just say I was extremely happy that I won two tickets for this maiden voyage. 5. Im currently holding this tenderloin in my hands, but sadly, I have not opened my eyes to gaze upon it yet. The time will come, though, when I see it. And it will be incredible. 6. Heres another cut of meat that has sensed my touch and stare. This one I was holding and touching in a helicopter a few years back. It was the helicopter of my rival, and he was trying to show me how much better his life was than mine. All I had was the meat, a far cry from a fully functional helicopter. So even though he asked me not to bring meat onto his helicopter, I insisted. It made me feel less small.

"10 Steps To Rolling The Perfect Joint Posted today Looking to enjoy a little bit of relaxation Youll probably want to practice the lost art of joint rolling. With just 10 easy steps, anyone can roll the perfect joint but enjoy responsibly Step 1 Fill the tub. Step 2 Get the weedthe dark fruit, the bush that grows in the shadow of the valley of the shadow of weed, the jesters hiccup, the liquid daydream fresh from the icecube tray, the wisdom tooth of the vegetables ogre, Israeli nightshade, the Arizona iced tea of drugs, the dad baffler, the sweet teen poison, the sickly crop of the wind farm, the flower the devil dares not pickout of your fridge. Set it aside. Step 3 A filter keeps fire from squirming into your throat and laying its eggs in your brainstem. Build the filter by pouring a mixture of egg whites and ground hen bones into a filter mold, and leave it at your parents house over a long weekend to set. Step 4 Get your rolling paper by stripping a few inches of skin off the Paper Wretch with a hot carrot peeler. It may take a few tries to get a good swath Step 5 To break up the weed, place it on an active fault line in a bowl full of gravel. Step 6 Once a major tectonic event has ground your weed, pound it into a paste using a book about a curious incident. Step 7 Wrap your index finger in paper and feed the weed paste into your port. A chilly sensation means your body has accepted the paste and will pass it on. A prickling sensation means your body has rejected the paste and will hopefully pee it out someday. Step 8 Seal the joint by licking your paperedup finger like a naughty little thing. Youre filthy, arent you Step 9 Remove finger, twist paper, and voil The perfect joint for any mouth. Step 10 Dunk the joint in the tub so you arent tempted to smoke it and become insane. Start over at step one Dont get discouraged if you dont get it right on the first try.

"Email Over the past year, a few highprofile court cases involving rape have spurred an intense national discussion on the topic. Whether it was Brock Turner, a Stanford swimmer who was sentenced to six months in a county jail for his rape of an unconscious woman, or Owen Labrie, a student at an elite prep school who raped a 14yearold classmate but was arraigned on lesser charges, our justice system has tried to convict rapists with varying degrees of success. As a father, I look at these cases, and I cant help but worry for my children. In times like these, we must take a stand, and we must teach our sons that being brought to trial and then convicted of rape is simply, utterly wrong. Our children, and more specifically, our boys, need to know that they should never, under any circumstances, be put in a situation where they could potentially lose a case accusing them of sexual assault. My son knows that, and every parent should make an effort to teach their boys the same. Whether they made the vile, unforgivable mistake of having a bad lawyer, calling an unreliable witness, or openly admitting to their crime to an undecided jury, Americas youth must understand that being convicted of rape should never, ever happen. Going to court for sexual assault is one thing, but being declared guilty is quite another, and as responsible parents, we need to do everything in our power to ensure that no child crosses that line, no questions asked. Bottom line, we need to do a better job at showing our sons that there is no worse mistake a young man can make than being declared guilty of rape, not now, not ever. I dont care who you areif you have a son, you need to teach him that being convicted of rape, even just one time, is unforgivable. The truth is, the moment your boy loses a rape trial is the moment that lives are ruined, and theres absolutely no taking that back. As a father of a young man myself, I would not be able to live with myself if he someday went to jail just because of something as easily preventable as a sexual assault conviction. When I look into my 8yearold Callums eyes, the last thing I want to think about is my little guy becoming the type of man who cant somehow weasel his way out of a highprofile court case, in front of all his friends, family, and the public at large. Bottom line, we need to do a better job at showing our sons that there is no worse mistake a young man can make than being declared guilty of rape, not now, not ever. Because if we want this generation of boys to grow into men that we truly take pride in, we have to start teaching them that any young man who gets punished for rape brings shame not only to himself but also to his gender, and this country as a whole. So please, dont wait. Please talk to your son today about his responsibility to never be convicted of rape, and to speak up if he ever sees someone else in danger of being convicted of rape. Our future depends on it.",satire
"Email The president has to be kicking himself over this one. As his term in office comes to a close, it seems as if Barack Obama may have missed out on a pretty spectacular opportunity. Earlier today, the president was told that he had been allowed to sleep in the White House this whole time, after he spent nearly two full terms living in a hotel by Reagan National Airport. Sorry, Mr. President, but its true. You really blew your chance on this one. Having booked an extended stay at the airport Hilton upon his inauguration back in 2009, Barack and his family have resided in an atriumview room with two double beds and complimentary wifi for the past eight years. But earlier this week when a senior advisor asked the president why he had chosen to live by the airport instead of the White House, you could tell that Obama hadnt realized the choice was his to make until that very moment. Yes, Obamas accomplished a lot over the years, but hes got to be wondering how much more progress he might have made living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. He would have had a lot more time to work on signature policies like the Affordable Care Act if he hadnt wasted so much of his mornings commuting from the airport to the Oval Office on the D.C. Metro. Theres no doubt the countless Hilton Rewards Points Obama has accrued is a nice perk, but that doesnt soften the blow of leaving the neoclassic mansion built exclusively to house the commander in chief and his family empty for two full terms. This is something Obama is going to regret for a long time to come. Nobody ever explicitly told me that I could live there until now, said a clearly disappointed Obama, as he waited patiently for a set of fresh towels. While Sasha and Malia love being on the same floor as the pool here, I now wish we had stayed at the lavish, 20,000squarefoot private residence in the White House for the past eight years. One time in 2011, I slept underneath my desk after a late night, and I was worried someone was going to find me there in the morning and yell at me. Now Im being told we apparently have a personal chef and dozens of butlers. This sucks. Sorry, Barry, but this ones kind of on you.

"6 Things That Happen In Every Jane Austen Story Ever Posted today Email Jane, we love ya, but maybe mix it up a little 1. Someone named Bullfinch comes back from vacation If, in the middle of a tense dinner party between members of rival agrarian families, a man suddenly bursts through the wall wearing a Hawaiian shirt and carrying luggage, and someone in the back of the room shouts, Hot damn Bullfinch is back from vacation then you can be sure that youre reading a Jane Austen novel. 2. One chapter briefly digresses from the main storyline to describe a clever, bonnetwearing mule Literary scholars attribute Austens obsession with bonnetwearing mules to the fact that whenever a publisher would pay Austen for her work, such an animal would immediately knock her down and eat all her money. Savvy readers know just to skip these chapters 3. Yorkshire County lifts up and moves itself a few inches further into the North Sea to try and crush skinnydippers Some say that, had Austen written another two novels, all the land of Yorkshire wouldve finally flattened the naked swimmers itd always lusted to suffocate. 4. Characters spend the entirety of a picnic trying to remember the word picnic SISTER 1 I do believe the proper nomenclature is dirt supper.SISTER 2 Nonsense Mother insists it is called a scoundrels meal.SISTER 3 Now, now, let us not be uncomely. I happen to know, as a matter of fact, that it is called a porknock. Every. Damn. Book 5. Abraham Lincoln always shows up at the main characters home and asks to use the toilet Did they even have toilets back then Whether its Northanger Abbey or Mansfield Park , Sense And Sensibility or Persuasion , theres always that part where Honest Abe is standing at the front door, holding his top hat over his crotch region and politely asking if he can make disgrace in the family commode. 6. The local butcher tries to insert himself into any love triangle that will have him This Austen staple was first seen in Pride And Prejudice , where Brigsby the Butcher sheepishly presents Fitzwilliam Darcy, Elizabeth Bennet, and Anne de Bourgh with a sack full of raw ribeye and quietly begs them to break his heart too. If youve read any other Austen novel, you know the scorned butcher is as essential to her writing as the setting of Victorian England.",satire

"Email Well, this isnt good. Most people think of Costco as the place that sells bulk quantities of pretty much everything. But the warehouse superstore is now making headlines for a very different reason, and it could serve to tarnish their brand The Blue Angels accidentally flew into the Costco in Augusta, GA and are currently stuck flying around inside the discount retailer. Worst of all, it doesnt seem like Costco has any idea how to get the airplane stunt squadron to leave. The Blue Angels were performing at a routine air show in Augusta, GA earlier today when they veered too close to the Costco and zipped through the automatic doors as they slid open for a customer. Before Costco employees could react, the diamond formation of five F/A18 Hornets had entered the store and began performing deathdefying aerial feats right over the shelves of bulk cereals and jumbosize ketchups. Customers are trying to ignore the roaring jets overhead, but its hard to concentrate on your shopping list when sonic booms keep knocking over pallets of Kirklandbrand dog food. Its usually a welcome treat to see the Blue Angels conduct synchronized barrel rolls, but inside Costco, the elite pilots are proving to be a serious nuisance. So far all attempts to evict the Blue Angels have proved unsuccessful. At first, Costco staff just propped the front door open with a bucket, assuming the Blue Angels would find their way back out eventually. After an hour, when choreographed smoke trails continued to plague the store, the manager grabbed a lacrosse stick from a sporting goods display and tried to shoo the planes toward the exit. Unfortunately, that only caused the Blue Angels to accelerate to 700 mph and perform several looptheloops in the freezer aisle, where the pilots hit a truly exhilarating 8 Gs. Your heart just has to break for this poor manager. With the store set to close in only a few hours, Costco better think up a solution fast, or Blue Angels will be locked in overnight. If that happens, then tomorrows customers will be aggravated by more of the same worldclass aeronautic showmanship. What an absolute hassle.",satire

Two years ago, John Fitzpatrick got the most devastating phone call of his life when he learned that his brother Robert had died of a heart attack in his sleep. John instantly thought of Roberts 18yearold daughter, Sophie, who was just starting to forge her path in life. Thats when this amazing uncle decided to step up in a seriously inspiring way With Robert no longer there for her, John took it upon himself to discourage his nieces art career. Okay, is someone cutting onions in here Because were getting just a little bit teary. Ever since his brothers passing, John has made it a point to call his niece every single Sunday evening to remind Sophie just how much her father loved her, how proud hed be if he could see her now, and how unstable a career in the arts can be compared to more traditional ninetofive employment. Sophies true passion in life has always been drawing and painting, but thanks to her selfless uncles constant reminders that almost nobody actually ends up working their dream job, shes now just two years away from getting her BA in marketing I want Sophie to know that she can always depend on me, John explained, gazing tearfully at an old photograph of Robert holding his baby girl. But she cannot depend on freelance income, especially in a field as oversaturated and undervalued as the arts. Shes way too smart for that. John has never faltered in his commitment to making sure his niece understands just how unrealistic it is to earn a living as an artist. Last summer, when Sophie landed an internship at a Brooklyn art gallery, John spent countless hours reminding her that New York is expensive, dangerous, and very far away from Ohio, before ultimately finding her a job doing administrative work for his friend instead. And when Sophie briefly considered getting a double major in studio art, her uncle pulled out all the stops, even going so far as to gain control of her late fathers finances so that he could temporarily withhold the semesters tuition check until she changed her mind Incredible Is there an Uncle of the Year award Because this guy definitely just won it. While nobody can ever take the place of Sophies father, it is seriously heartwarming to see John step up to the plate like this. Sophie is so lucky to have an uncle she can always turn to for love, guidance, and stacks of brochures for MBA programs handed to her at every family holiday. Heres to you, John",satire

"Email In an election season full of anger and divisiveness, its easy to lose sight of just how important and meaningful our democratic process is. Thankfully, as millions have cast their ballots today, theres been no shortage of heartwarming stories involving Americans exercising their right to vote. One of those stories centers around lifelong Mississippi resident Helen Karnes, who, although not quite old enough to have been born before women won the right to vote, is still pretty goddam old. Wow. What a special woman While Karnes cant claim that she was alive during a time when women were still politically disenfranchised, it just takes one look at her to tell that shes fucking old. No, she might not have the inspiring, thematically satisfying story of a 100yearold, but you get the sense that shes definitely lived through some shit. She was certainly around in WWII times, and she mightve even been there for the Depression, too. Who knows This is no spring chicken were talking about here. Though, admittedly, Karnes story would be a bit cooler if shed been alive before 1920, you still have to applaud her for being old on this historic Election Day. Also, her mom and her aunts were definitely alive before womens suffrage, so you know shes probably got some good secondhand stories that she heard from them. Maybe one of them was even an important figure in the womens rights movement or something. Statistically speaking, thats probably not the case, but you never know Its unclear if Karnes voted today for Americas first female presidential nominee, or if she even voted at all. But what matters is that shes brittle, stoopedover, and ancient. There are probably lots of dusty ol bats out there who are older than Karnes and who have more of a substantial foothold in U.S. womens history, but this lady is still more or less a living skeleton.

With hours to go before polls close, voter watchdog groups across the country are reporting that many laser tag establishments are staying open today. This is seriously alarming news. In what appears to be a concerted effort to prevent Americans from casting their ballots on time, dozens of laser tag locations are keeping normal business hours on Election Day, inviting one and all to enjoy nonstop laser tag action with all the coolest terrain and equipment. If true, this could represent voter suppression on an unprecedented, scarcely conceivable scale. Its appalling to see laser tag placessome of them located within blocks of polling stations in swing statesdeploying everything from signs to roadside billboards to social media posts in an attempt to stop Americans from exercising their civic duty.

Some of these laser tag facilities are continuing to operate roller rinks, 18hole mini golf courses, and gokart tracks in a shameless ploy to lure voters as far as possible from the booths, said Holst.

Democracy FTW You might not know their names, but these hardworking men and women are out there in the trenches from Maine to California, slathering thick, black oil on the ground so every American can skid down the road, windmilling their arms wildly to try and stay upright, and careen straight through the doors of a voting booth. Republican or Democrat, these patriotic volunteers want every American to have access to a frictionless slick of oil that leads right to a polling place. Yes These incredible volunteers are absolutely killing it Rather than letting our election be decided by a select few, people from across the nation are volunteering their time to make sidewalks welllubricated and slippery for as many voters as possible. As of this morning, footpaths have been oiled in all 50 states, giving people who would not otherwise have the time or desire to vote the opportunity to lose their balance and slide forward at alarming speeds with their arms flailing and legs kicking, until they crash facefirst into a registered polling location.

They vehemently oppose the others candidate of choice and couldnt differ more on the direction our country should be heading in. Yet, as this heatedly divisive election cycle comes to a head, these two demonstrated just how powerful a united American people can be when we put our differences aside and work together Sarah, a Trump supporter, and Colleen, a Clinton supporter, held each others hair back while vomiting out of intense election anxiety. In a campaign season as contentious as this one, you really have to stop and appreciate moments like this. Though Sarah and Colleen come from opposite ends of the political spectrum, you wouldnt know it when looking into the stall at their polling station in Cranford, NJ, where they both lowered their heads into the same trash can and took turns holding each others hair back as they retched over the psychological toll this long, strenuous elections taken on them. No arguing, no fingerpointing, no namecalling just dual streams of stressinduced upchuck crescendoing in a duet of dryheaving. The sight of two people, who have been bombarded for months with messages that the other candidate will completely ruin the country as they know it, patting one another on the back and encouraging each other to get it all out, is all too welcome in an otherwise toxic and polarizing campaign season. Need more proof that its possible for Trump and Clinton supporters to overcome their shared animosity during this historical moment of anxiety Colleen even offered Sarah an Altoid once theyd both stopped throwing up and cleaned the barf from their shirts. Further, Sarah graciously let Colleen borrow her eyeliner, which had been smudged due to the tears summoned by a panic attack she experienced while in line to vote. After checking in to make sure the other was feeling all right one last time, each went their separate ways, having found rare common ground with their political opposites in the form of sickening anxiety stoked by the intense fear politics and extremist partisan rhetoric deployed in the 2016 election. Yup, the spirit of Abraham Lincoln is alive, knitting a torn nation back together. Look at the media and youll see interactions between Trump and Clinton supporters portrayed as vitriolic and irreconcilably at odds.

"Email With millions of eyes watching CNN for election results tonight, the network really couldnt afford any highprofile screwups. But unfortunately, thats exactly what they got when John King tapped his touchscreen electoral map too hard and plunged himself straight into a digital hellscape from which there seems to be no escape. Ouch. Thats some major egg on CNNs face The night appeared to be going smoothly in the networks Washington studio, until King tried to zoom in on a breakdown map of crucial Ohio swing districts. When the map seemed to freeze up, a frustrated King tapped the Magic Wall with enough force that his whole arm plunged through the suddenly fluid surface of the screen. Before Wolf Blitzer or Anderson Cooper could step in, he had been fully engulfed in a vast virtual expanse of colorful, swirling data. With millions of Americans tuning in to watch the results of this historic election, CNN has been forced to press on even as they try to free John King from the computerized map. A noticeably emotional Wolf Blitzer mouthed the words Im sorry to his imprisoned colleague before tapping the board to call up a gender breakdown of likely Oregon voters, the bar graph of which animated right into John Kings spine, launching nearly all the way to the midAtlantic states. If CNN producers thought that they had stabilized the situation by urging King to take refuge in the bottom corner of the screen, it did not take long for them to realize how wrong they were. When Connecticut was called for Hillary Clinton, the trapped John King was also turned entirely blue and let loose a horrible scream as if he were being burned alive. This level of panic was matched moments later when King tried to fend off a ravenous piece of malware with just his loafer, only for the shoe to shatter into pixels that the code devoured. Yikes. CNN will be wondering for a while how this all went so wrong, and on their biggest night, too. With plenty of states left to declare tonight, theres still time for King to be rescued from the computerized nightmare. But with uploading a JPEG of a ladder for him to climb up and trying to shepherd him onto a thumb drive having already failed to return King to the studio, CNN may be running out of options. No matter how this shakes out, its clear CNN has a MAJOR technology fail on their hands. Then again, this is just what happens when anchors play with tech toys without reading the instructions. Well, better luck in 2020, guys.",satire

"Email Well, Donald Trump certainly has cause for celebration today. Despite having a multibilliondollar net worth, an international real estate company, and a primetime television show, Donald Trumps ambitions were still set higher. The one trophy hed spent his entire life trying to claim for his mantle of accomplishments had always evaded himuntil today. By winning the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump is finally able to kick the nations most powerful black family out of their house. One can only imagine the immense joy Donalds wife and children feel for him today. Trump has been preparing for this moment ever since the Trump Organization first started buying buildings throughout New York City and raising rent for AfricanAmericans until he could toss them out for no longer being able to afford it. Now, after decades of practice and determination, the presidentelect will see his magnum opus arrive in the form of booting the incredibly influential and powerful Obama family out of the home theyve lived in for the past eight years. Ejecting black people from their residences has been a lifelong passion for Donald. From practicing discriminatory housing policies that prevented black people from moving into Trump buildings to tagging black peoples rental applications with a separate sheet of paper marked C for colored, Donald has never lost focus on his goal. But that was all just warmup for Trump, who clearly wanted to challenge himself by attempting to evict a wealthy black family of international renown. And when he sends President Obama, Michelle, Malia, Sasha, and all their boxedup belongings packing from their house in January, Trump will have done just that. What a truly stunning feat. With the biggest item on his bucket list now firmly checked off, Trump would be more than justified in resting on his laurels to soak in the consummation of all his dreams. Its hard to imagine an even more powerful and famous black family Donald could evict, but knowing Trump, he will continue to push himself. Whatever his plans are now, the world will be watching in anxious anticipation.",satire
"Thirtytwoyearold Samantha Collins She may not look like your typical hero, but her incredible story is one you absolutely need to read right now. Against all odds, this courageous young woman woke up and went to work today. Amazing We should all strive to be as fearless as Samantha. When her alarm sounded this morning at 6 a.m., Samantha dug deep and did something unbelievable Summoning all the willpower she had, she somehow found the strength inside herself to pull back her sheets and put two feet on the floor as if this were any other day Samantha then headed straight into the shower, where she miraculously managed to shampoo her hair, turn off the water, and even get dressed for work before resolutely grabbing a granola bar as she headed out the door. Her remarkable heroism didnt stop there. Defying all her basic instincts, Samantha was soon sitting on a bus while it drove in the direction of her office Faced with a situation where other women might have given up, Samantha bravely stood up, pressed the button to request her stop, and even had the conviction to get off the bus when it came to a halt This womans courage and determination should be an inspiration to us all. As if this story werent already inspiring enough, Samantha then went to all three of her morning meetings, battling through intermittent waves of nausea and behaving as if nothing at all had changed since last night. Incredible The world could use a few more heroes like Samantha who refuse to let anything stop them from going through the motions, returning home, and getting ready to do it all again every day for at least the next four years. Keep fighting the good fight, Samantha",satire
"Email If this story doesnt put a smile on your face, literally nothing will. Kimberly Kovax, an 11yearold girl from Allentown, PA has been interested in politics and government from a very young age, and she followed the historic campaign of Hillary Clinton closely. But, when Hillary lost on Tuesday, that meant something incredible for Kimberly She still gets to dream of being the first female president. Wow This must be a truly special moment for Kimberly. The moment Hillary Clinton made her concession speech Wednesday morning, Kimberlys opportunity to become the first woman elected to the Oval Office opened right back up. Though it may not be for 40, 50, maybe even 60 years, this key milestone in feminism is all Kimberlys to aspire toward. Some may say that another woman will be elected the first female president in the three decades before Kimberlys even eligible to run, but if the 2016 election is any indication, it looks like she is still very much in the running to break the gender barrier in the Oval Office. Who knows Kimberly could even be the first female president to relegalize abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned at some point in the next four years It must feel truly incredible for girls in America to see that this huge accomplishment is still on the table, theirs for the eventual taking. The fact that Americas ugliest, most intolerant tendencies prevailed over Clinton means millions of girls can still envisage themselves as the one to make that landmark feminist achievement, and it doesnt get more powerful than that. Yup, were uplifted as hell right nowyou go, Kimberly When the time comes, you can certainly count on our vote.",satire

What the heck happened Well, theres a lot we dont know yet about this election, but Ill tell you this Maybe you shouldnt have made fun of my exclamation point. Yeah, remember the exclamation point The big n red mark plopped next to my serifedup name like a trout on the counter We put that logo out, and you people laughed. Oh, how you laughed. Hey, looks like ol Wonder Bread Jebs trying to squeeze some enthusiasm out of his limp little campaign You think I didnt hear you You think I didnt see what you wrote Of course I did. The taunts, the memes, the novelty Twitter handles, typed with a sneer. I saw all of it, and it hurt me. It hurt Jeb. You turned me and my exclamation mark into a big dippy joke, and look what it got you. Dread. Defeat. Humiliation. Feel that despair in your gut today, and now imagine if you had JEB in your life right now, splashed across every TV and touchscreen. Hey, theres some punctuation thatd put pep in your step But nope, the guy who sticks his neck out to make electoral politics just a keystroke more exciting gets ribbed, roasted, raked over the coals, and hung out to dry. Look, I wasnt a perfect candidate. I know that. But that doesnt mean you had to steer this country straight into a xenophobic hellhole. That exclamation point was plain fun. It stood out from the pack. It even looked nice on a Tshirt or a coozy. You made a huge mistake the moment you collectively decided to rip my exclamation point to shreds. I was up all night coming up with it, you know. That  was a John Ellis Bush original. Id already tried out a question mark too uncertain, an ellipsis too ambiguous, even two exclamation points too forceful, so when I hit on the idea of an exclamation point I really thought I had something special. I was so excited to share my excitement with you. Turns out I might as well have slapped my thick, pink matte dick into my hand and waggled it all over Facebook Live like a dang date palm frond, for all the love you gave me. Look, I wasnt a perfect candidate. I know that. But that doesnt mean you had to steer this country straight into a xenophobic hellhole.

Its time to iron those pantsuits and put on those heels, because the day has finally come when its totally fine to sob openly in your office, and theres nothing men can do to stop you For far too long, women have been marginalized, written off, and told that there are certain things they can never achieve.

But just when this teen was ready to stop hiding who he really is, something incredible happened Donald Trump and Mike Pence were elected into the White House, and Taylor just got another four years to plan his viral comingout video Um, luckiest teen ever Up until now, Taylor figured hed just prop his iPhone up to record the moment he came out to his parents, but after watching the presidential election results come in last night, Taylor knew that he needed to scrap that plan immediately. This lucky teen now has until at least 2020 before he can safely come out of the closet, and thats more than enough time to come up with the sort of nextlevel viral video idea that could seriously break the internet Instead of releasing some halfbaked, hastily edited video on his YouTube channel this spring, Taylor will now get to spend at least the next four years of a Trump/Pence administration dreaming up the most heartwarming and totally shareable comingout video imaginable. And depending on how the next election goes, this kid just might get the chance to keep brainstorming camera angles and staging options in his head until hes well into his mid20s or older. So awesome With cameras only getting better and better, its possible that four years from now well even get to witness Taylor finally arrive at some sort of peace with himself in stunning, crystalclear 8K resolution.

"Email One year ago, I was arrested for both statutory rape and possessing child pornography, and I deeply regret my disgusting crimes. Since that fateful day, Ive been serving a 16year jail sentence, using every second of that time to reflect on, and repent for, what I have done. Ive truly learned a lot about myself as a person, and if our presidentelect, Donald Trump, were to recognize my transformation and to pardon me, I would be honored to serve as his Secretary of Agriculture. In the event Donald J. Trump pardons and then appoints me to his future Cabinet, I, Jared Fogle, current federal inmate and former Subway spokesperson, could think of no greater privilege than to serve our commander in chief, and our country, as the head of our Department of Agriculture. It is the Secretary of Agricultures sworn duty to provide assistance to our nations farmers, as well as to protect farmland and enforce food safety, and if I am let out of jail, I believe I am ready for the task. To have Donald Trump both forgive my childsex crimes and recognize how useful my deep knowledge of lettuce, tomatoes, onions, peppers, hot Italian peppers, olives, and other sub toppings could be to his administration would make my heart swell with pride. To serve our farmers at the federal level would be greater than any Subway sandwich I ever ate, greater than any Subway commercial I ever made, and greater than any large pair of pants I ever wore. As someone who has sold hundreds of millions of Subway sandwiches to the American people since the year 2000, I know the burden of working for the public, and I would not let our new president, nor the American people, down. It would be an immense privilege to serve for a full four years, and pending Donald Trump negating my seven federal counts of production of child pornography, I would start that process immediately. I lost over 245 pounds and ate thousands of Subway sandwiches before I was arrested for paying for sex with a minor, and I do hope that Presidentelect Trump considers that fact when making his decision whether or not to pardon and appoint me secretary of agriculture. To serve our farmers at the federal level would be greater than any Subway sandwich I ever ate, greater than any Subway commercial I ever made, and greater than any large pair of pants I ever wore. So, hopefully, the next time I address you, it will be not from my prison cell in Englewood Federal Correctional Institution but from the National Mall, in Washington, D.C. Believe me, the next four years would be incredible not just for me, but for you, should our presidentelect look deep into his heart and give the department the spokesperson it deserves",satire

When the CEO of Firestone Tires heard Alexas story, he surprised her by showing up at the hospital with dozens of exclusive photos of the companys entire 2017 tire lineup. What an amazing gesture The rest of us will have to wait until next July to see these tires, but thanks to the incredible generosity of Firestone CEO Gary Garfield, Alexa got a special advance peek on Tuesday. According to Alexas parents, Garfield entered the ward totally unannounced carrying a large briefcase containing what he called a glimpse of the future of American tires. Garfield then had the hospital room cleared to make sure that the photos of Firestones tire offerings were for Alexas eyes only. Staying for a full hour despite his busy schedule, he was able to give Alexa detailed descriptions of the tread life, fuel efficiency, and allweather performance for the full range of tires set to be released under the Firestone brand next year. Alexa has been incredibly brave and strong. Im so glad I could share these tire design specs with her, said Garfield.

"Email With protests erupting across the country this week and emotions running high, American companies are trying to make sense of how to react to a Trump presidential election win. But one major company has clearly made up its mind and just came down squarely in the antiTrump camp in a big way Donald Trump will be added to Disneys Hall Of Presidents, but his animatronic figure will be able to feel pain. Wow. Disney just showed that it does not pull punches when it comes to what the company believes in. Check out the press release they put out this morning Disney prides itself on promoting inclusivity, empathy, and nonviolence, which are values that Mr. Trumps presidency threatens. Thats why when we eventually add him to our Hall Of Presidents exhibit in Disney Worlds Magic Kingdom, his mechanical replica will bear the capacity to suffer horribly, and without limit. Being a company that caters to diverse families, we felt it was a moral responsibility to have Mr. Trumps robotic counterpart be receptive to extreme thirst and burning sensations, while also being wired with the knowledge that it can never receive the sweet mercy of death. This is the best way for us to uphold the Hall Of Presidents tradition while also voicing our vigorous objection to the Trump administration. Given that Disneys software makes the animatronic believe its bones are shattering each time it moves or speaks, this company clearly wants people to know its not onboard the Trump train. Park visitors who feel similarly opposed to Trumps presidency can rest assured that his Hall Of Presidents double will be designed to experience anxiety, so its always aware that more pain is coming. Although the machine will understand what joy is, its programming will never allow it to feel that. And Disneys not letting Trump off the hook there. The replicas for Abraham Lincoln and George Washington will even be reprogrammed to slap, scratch, and pry the fingernails off the animatronic Trump, which will respond to such painful stimuli by gasping, crying, screaming, vomiting, or a mix of all of these. If that doesnt send a powerful statement about where Disney stands politically, we dont know what does. Its safe to say we wont see the Trumps vacationing there anytime soon. Dont share Disneys disdain for a Trump presidency You may be better off heading to Space Mountain instead of the Hall Of Presidents, because Disney has officially drawn the battle line right there.

Zoo administrators are always experimenting with ways to make their animals caged experiences as accommodating to their needs as possible, with varying degrees of success. But thanks to an innovative and humane new initiative, one of our most beloved institutions is setting a new standard for animal rights. The San Diego Zoo has taped telescopes to all of their animals heads so that they can look at the planets. What a tremendous step forward For decades, the San Diego Zoo led the way in terms of tourist attractions, but this latest move proves that they are even more committed to treating their animals with dignity. With a telescope affixed to each animals head, these incredible creatures can now gaze at the planets just by looking up. Visitors can take great comfort knowing that the ostriches, chinchillas, and all other animals are no longer limited to just looking at trees, dirt, or clouds, as they had been for so many heartbreaking years. According to president and CEO Douglas Myers, the project directly addresses a basic right of all animals. When you consider the challenges we face when improving animal captivity, strapping a telescope snugly to each animals head is a nobrainer, said Myers. These are beautiful creatures that deserve to look at the planets. Indeed, most zoo animals have never had the ability to take in the wonders of our galaxy, but in San Diego its now a key part of every animals care plan. At any moment, an otter can swivel his head and take a look at Saturn. A zebra can glance up from grazing to observe a sea of constellations seemingly close enough to lick. And when the park welcomed a new fox last month, tourists were able to watch as zoologists strapped a tiny telescope to his head, equipped with a polarized filter to protect his sensitive eyes. Wow Well, if you needed another reason to finally visit the San Diego Zoo, youve officially got it. Hopefully, this will encourage zoos everywhere to continue to explore new ways to address the welfare of their animals. Thankfully, they now have an excellent place to start.",satire
"Email Automation in the workplace can bring new levels of efficiency and employee happiness, but it can also mean that human workers lose their jobs in favor of robotic replacements. No matter your stance on cuttingedge technology in the office, there is no doubt that its a swiftly approaching reality. According to a new study released by Stanford University, Americans can expect over 50 percent of all workplace discrimination to be fully automated by 2040. The future is coming, and its coming fast. Thanks to recent advancements in computer intelligence and predictive analytics, it may not be long before you see an automated machine in your office demoting female employees for becoming pregnant. Whether humiliating subordinates with unwanted sexual comments or automatically filtering out rsums from people with Middle Eastern last names, trends in technological development suggest that an increasingly computerized workforce will soon be enforcing inequality in office environments with far greater proficiency and costeffectiveness than human labor. People think that automated workplace discrimination is still far off in the future, when truthfully its right around the corner, said Stanford computer scientist Dr. Oliver Thorpe, who spearheaded the new study. Were already at the point with facial recognition software where it can identify which genders and races should be passed up for leadership roles with far greater accuracy than humans, and technologies like this are only getting better and cheaper by the day. With intelligent algorithms becoming rapidly more sophisticated and capable, virtually every industry can soon expect to begin replacing humans with machines that can oppress minorities, senior citizens, and other subjugated people groups with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy. Within 10 years, marketavailable computers will have the ability to grossly neglect the needs of disabled workers and make them feel like burdens. Within 15 years, roving automatons will travel about openplan offices smacking female subordinates buttocks with their carbonfiber paddle attachments, adeptly wielding their power in such a way as to avoid consequences. Some believe that machines will never be able to fully replicate the complexity and intuitiveness of human onthejob prejudice, but employers will likely be willing to sacrifice that human touch for the sake of their bottom line. Thorpe notes that maintaining a fuckedup culture of occupational disparity is expensive, and as soon as companies realize that they can enlist semiautonomous robots to mistreat their employees at a fraction of the cost, theyll be lining up to install them in offices nationwide. Only time will tell whether or not the human workers who have so dutifully carried out discriminatory business practices for decades get laid off or reassigned, but one thing is for sure The American office is about to look way different.",satire

We understood that these images were a bit crass and promised to remove them if Trump were to win the election, as a sign of respect for the office of the United States presidency. True to our word, we tried to take these pictures down as soon as Trump was elected, but unfortunately we havent been able to figure out how to delete this article from our website.

We apologize that we werent able to remove this disrespectful picture of our presidentelect completely, but we did what we could and stretched it out all wide. You can barely tell its Donald Trump. 2. Regardless of whatever political views you hold, it is disrespectful to show a picture of the commanderinchief along with a caption like So this is what that pile of straw on his head is for. Were talking with our programmers now to figure out a way to delete these images from the web. Hopefully they will develop a method for doing so in the near future. In the meantime, we have preserved the dignity of Presidentelect Trump by stretching his face out and making his eyes huge. Nobody will be able to recognize that the man in this image is our new president. 3. Of course, it would still be fine to disagree with President Trump if you dont support his policies. A healthy democracy allows dissent and debate. However, implying that the president wears a toupee when there is no evidence that he does is a crass breach of proper decorum. The presidency is the most hallowed office in our nation, and it is worthy of reverence and decorum at all times. Ideally, this image of Donald Trumps toupee flying off in the wind would no longer be on our website. Since this is currently impossible, weve used the magic of Photoshop to make his head very tall and thin. His identity is obscured. This bald man could be anybody. 4. No matter who is president, you address them as Sir, not Donald the Hutt. We would quickly remove this if the American people choose Trump on November 8. This degrading Photoshop of President Trumps face on Jabba the Hutts body is immature and degrading, and wed remove it if we could. Since we currently dont know how, weve at least given him a tie to wear to imbue him with the poise and decorum the presidency confers on all who hold that hallowed office. 5. Comparing President Trump to Adolf Hitler would remain a valid political commentary, but making him bald in addition is completely uncalled for. If Donald Trump is elected, we promise to restore his normal hair to this image. Now that the American electorate has chosen Donald Trump to lead our nation, this image depicting him as a bald Adolf Hitler has become an unsubtle and tactless political statement that does not meet our exacting editorial standards. Weve given Presidentelect Trump his hair back in an effort to restore his dignity. 6. For now, let us enjoy this humorous Photoshop and its accompanying caption, I am going to build a wig, and Mexico is going to pay for it. During a Trump presidency, it would no longer have a place in the national discourse. All right, thats all of them. Weve stretched out Presidentelect Donald Trumps face all wide so that nobody will know that he is the bald man in this picture. Hopefully, well find a way to remove these pictures from our website, but until then, this will have to do.",satire
"Email It looks like Presidentelect Donald Trump is wasting no time making his mark on Washington. Hes already gotten to work appointing his new Cabinet members and laying the groundwork for his new administration. And if it wasnt already clear that things are going to be done Trumps way for the next four years, Donald Trump just whispered Hope you like to make ham, motherfucker to a White House executive chef. Wow It looks like Washington is going to be a very different place under President Trump Those who witnessed the encounter say that, during a recent visit to the White House, Trump caught sight of a highranking member of the White House kitchen, waved him over, and said, Come here, let me talk to you a minute, in a voice that was somehow both cordial and threatening. When the chef got close to Trump, the presidentelect shook his hand, pulled him close, and began whispering that once he got sworn in, the chef would be doing nothing but cooking him ham 24/7. Members of the White House staff overheard the phrases Ham is your life now, idiot and I dont care what else you can cook. I only want ham as Trump whispered to the chef, whose eyes grew wide with silent fear as he listened to what our nations newest president was telling him. They also say that Trump briefly smiled to wave to photographers before turning back to the chef with a dark and menacing expression on his face to continue whispering about ham. Now thats the sign of a president who isnt afraid to shake things up While many Americans are deeply troubled by the bigoted rhetoric of Trumps presidential campaign, those who voted for him as a protest against the political establishment have got to be pretty happy about a story like this one No other president would grab a White House chef by the hand and whisper, You live in Ham World now, motherfucker And it seems as if Presidentelect Trump has a concrete plan in place, as well Trump didnt just tell the White House chef that he wanted ham in general he had specific types of ham that he wanted, including baked ham, smoked ham all the time, and ham with frosting. Trump was also overheard telling the White House chef, Youre also going to be making something called a Pork Jackhammer, which I just invented during the limo ride over here. Its incredibly dangerous to make, and I want to eat it every day. It definitely looks like this is going to be a new era in Washington You just know its not going to be business as usual in D.C. anymore when Donald Trump isnt afraid to look a White House chef right in the eye and say, When I ask for Chinese food, that just means soy sauce on ham. When I ask for sushi, thats raw ham. President Trump will be eating barges of ham for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The moment I take the oath of office is the moment that your world becomes a porkfueled hellscape. People who voted for Trump wanted a maverick, and it looks like they got one After about two minutes of whispering hamrelated threats, Trump stepped away from the chef and began smiling and waving at the surrounding press as if nothing had happened, but his message was clear When Donald Trump becomes president, hes going to play by his own rules, and hes only going to eat ham If President Trump has his way, life in the White House might become completely unrecognizable",satire
"Email Donald Trumps inauguration may be months from now, but it looks like his Oval Office transition is already well under way. In addition to naming Reince Priebus his chief of staff and meeting with advisors on policy issues, Trump had to schedule in some time this week to go around to houses in the White Houses neighborhood and inform residents that hes moving in down the street. Looks like Trump is not wasting any time preparing for his big move to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.Hello, my name is Donald Trump, and as a new resident in this community, I am required to inform you that I have a history of sexually assaulting women, said the presidentelect while standing on one of his new neighbors doorsteps. In the past, I have grabbed women inappropriately, made multiple unwanted advances toward women, and harassed women with vulgar and inflammatory language. For this reason, I have to go door to door telling residents of my new presence in the neighborhood. Sorry to bother you, and have a nice day. After spending most of Tuesday exploring potential cabinet picks, Trump was later spotted going around the White Houses neighborhood and knocking on doors, continuing to alert his new neighbors to his history of sexual assault. Standing awkwardly on front porches and avoiding eye contact, Trump promised local residents that he wouldnt cause any trouble for them or their families and planned to mostly keep to himself for the next four years as president of the United States. He then finished the day by meeting with several economic advisors. Itll be interesting to see what a Trump presidency might look like as he spends the next few days crafting policy goals and reassuring his new neighbors that his motorcade will take alternate routes to ensure that he is never within a hundred yards of a school. If he keeps making the rounds at this pace, it wont be long before all of the residents of Pennsylvania Avenue have been made aware of his record of sexual assault. President Obama still has a few more months left in the White House, but pretty soon Trump will be moving in. So far, the presidentelect seems determined to make that transition as smooth as possible for him, his fellow Republicans, and the local residents whom he has been individually informing of his status as a sexual predator.",satire

"Email Get ready for the most cringeworthy story youre going to read all day. Panasonic might be one of the largest electronics manufacturers in the world, but after today, they may find themselves struggling to stay afloat. The companys president has been forced to resign in disgrace after 60,000 Panasonic TVs abruptly ascended to heaven without warning. Well give you a minute to finish shaking your head. The scandal broke early last night when 60,000 of the companys popular DX802model flatscreen TVs from all over the world silently lifted off of the ground and, despite their owners yelling at them to stop and trying to drag them back down to Earth, floated away from the mortal realm and into the kingdom of heaven to reside with the immortal seraphim for all eternity. Yikes. Needless to say, Panasonic customers are not happy Only a few minutes after the televisions began their skyward journey to the kingdom of God, Panasonic found themselves completely inundated with tweets like this Wow. Panasonic definitely wishes it could rewind the clock on this one Chances are, when youre trying to stay competitive as one of the worlds foremost electronics companies, the last thing you want is for tens of thousands of your televisions to drift skyward into paradise. Weve got to give credit where credit is due At least Panasonic had the decency to admit that they let their customers down. The company has issued a public apology, and in a drastic move, the president of the company, Kazuhiro Tsuga, chose to resign in the wake of this scandal. Speaking at a press conference this morning, Tsuga issued the following statement After much consideration, I have chosen to step down as the president of Panasonic Corp. If I could, I would travel to Heaven and retrieve each and every one of these televisions. I would kill any angel who tried to stop me from carrying these TVs out of paradise and returning them to our loyal Panasonic customers on Earth. Even if I saw God sitting on one of our missing DX802 flatscreens, I would shove the Lord off of the TV so that I could retrieve it for our customers. Unfortunately, I do not have the power to travel to Heaven, and so I am left with no choice but to resign my position. Tsugas resignation is a nice gesture, but it doesnt bring back a swarm of televisions from heaven. Panasonics reputation has been severely tarnished by the rapturing of their televisions. Whoever steps up to become Panasonics new president is going to have to do everything they can to prevent any of their products from ascending to heaven ever again.",satire

"Email Oh, how the mighty have fallen. Its always an embarrassing moment when a highpowered executive suffers a scandal that forces him or her to resign, but it looks like yet another head honcho is about to step into that humiliating spotlight After nearly a decade on the job, the CEO of beans has officially stepped down following reports that there cannot be a CEO of beans. Yikes. Talk about a fall from grace. Patrick Buckley was an ambitious leader as the CEO of beans, often telling people that he was in charge of every single bean that came out of the dirt, and even going so far as to print up business cards with CEO of beans listed right on the front. With beans being such a common staple of diets worldwide, a man in Mr. Buckleys position may have seemed poised to become one of the most powerful people in the food industry. But in the blink of an eye, everything the executive had been working for came crashing down before him, as reports began to circulate late last week that while bean manufacturers may have CEOs, its impossible for beans in general to have a CEO of their own. After a wonderful career at the helm of beans, it has become apparent that there is no such thing as my job, the scandalized CEO wrote in a brief statement to the press. In light of this news that my position, and my former role as director of garbanzo, do not exist, it seems prudent that I step down immediately. I am proud of the work I have done for beans during my tenure, and I look forward to continuing to prepare and eat beans in the future. As of this morning, the board of directors of beans has accepted Mr. Buckleys resignation, and then the members promptly stepped down themselves amidst reports that beans cannot have a board of directors, either. Making matters worse, the entire corporate structure of beans now finds itself crumbling from the top all the way down, as an onslaught of new allegations indicate that beans, as a relatively loose category of foods, has never been and cannot be a staffable organization. Wow. Its hard to imagine how Mr. Buckley will ever bounce back from such a disgrace, but hopefully he learns an important lesson from all this.

Well, it seems like some wires got crossed somewhere, but okay Way to take action, Angela In the days since Trumps victory, shes cleaned out the deodorant inventories of multiple Omahaarea grocery stores, apparently under the impression that deodorant will soon become much more difficult to acquire than it is now.

For whatever reason, Angela is also taking to Facebook to encourage her peers to follow suit in stashing away lots of deodorant as soon as possible Wow. Its unclear how she came to the wellmeaning but mistaken conclusion that it was necessary to hoard hundreds of dollars worth of deodorant in preparation for Trumps first term, but its hard not to be impressed by how much deodorant Angela has amassed in the past few days Even if shes a little off base here, Angela is showing the importance of not being complacent in the face of tyranny, and we think thats awesome.

"I had a garage sale today, and a number of people came and bought stuff. Most of them left. Here are the ones who are still sticking around. 1. The Guy Who Bought My Lamp I expected the guy who bought my lamp to leave after he bought my lamp. But he did not leave. He sat down on my lawn and started reading the newspaper. I went up to him and asked him if he needed help with anything, and he said, Nope. Been saving my appetite all day. I didnt really know what that meant, but someone had a question about my foosball table at that moment so I didnt have time to get clarification on that. 2. The Couple Who Didnt Buy Anything But Spent A Lot Of Time Browsing My Box Of National Geographic sAnd Then Got In Their Car And Took A Nap These people seemed really into my National Geographic s, so I was pretty surprised when they decided not to buy them. I was also surprised when, instead of leaving, they just got in their car and started napping. Theyre still asleep, and theres a little Postit on their window that says, Wake us up when its ready. 3. The Old Woman Who Bought My Vacuum When the old lady who bought my vacuum offered to pay for my vacuum by vacuuming my house, I thought it was a little odd but also kind of nice. My place is a little dusty these days, and definitely could use a good vacuuming. So I said yes. I wish that she had left after she finished vacuuming my house. She is now in the kitchen and has been vacuuming the same corner for the last 20 minutes. Plus, she keeps chiming in on how to make the pasta sauce. I have to admit she did a pretty good job cleaning my house, though. I dont know how to ask her to leave without sounding rude. 4. The Lady Who Bought A Plate, A Fork, And A Knife I assumed this woman bought these items for her own home, but its been three hours and she is just standing by the front door sneaking peeks at the kitchen through the window. This is becoming stressful. 5. The Kid Who Bought My Toaster Even Though I Told Him It Was Broken And Then Handed Me A List Of His Allergies When this kid asked me how much I wanted for the toaster, I was upfront about the fact that it was broken. But that didnt matter to him. He bought the thing for 50 cents and then handed me a list of allergies he had. Now he is sitting out on the lawn along with the guy who bought my lamp, and I think theyre working on a crossword puzzle together. I really dont think I have enough ingredients to make food for all these people. Also, there are a lot of allergies on this list. 6. The Older Gentleman Who Brought A Raw Steak To My Garage Sale And Then Bought A Coatrack I dont know why the old man who bought the coatrack brought a raw steak to my garage sale. After he purchased the coatrack, he placed the raw steak in a dish to marinate, then put it in my garage fridge. I asked him what he was doing, and he said, Gotta marinate this bad boy for dos horas, compadre. Buon appetito. He is still here, and his steak is still marinating.

"Email The cruelty of factory farms is a daily nightmare for billions of animals, but that might soon start to change thanks to a forwardthinking initiative by one of the biggest names in the meat industry. In a humane act of compassion for their livestock, the Oscar Mayer Company now requires its pork suppliers to give their pigs one thrilling sexual experience before sending them to slaughter. Its pretty difficult to overstate what a huge leap forward this is for animal rights. The details of the new policy are extremely promising Once a pig reaches sexual maturity, factory workers must lather it in a warming lubricant and place it in an outdoor pen, where it will encounter dozens of sows in heat and boars specially bred to produce voluptuously potent pheromone levels. The pigs will then be encouraged to partake in any variety of sowonboar, sowonsow, boaronboar, or autoerotic swineplay they prefer. Only after theyve bellowed long, guttural squeals of satisfaction will these pigs be killed, processed, and separated into their desirable parts for human consumption. Conscious consumers can rest assured Oscar Mayer pork will have been treated to full prostate and teat stimulation via doubleprodded toys, clamps, and strategically placed ice cubes before being sent to the slaughterhouse. Farmers will even have to install sprinklers emitting warm hog urine for any pig who might be into that. Wow. It seems like Oscar Mayer is truly dedicated to setting a new bar for ethical animal treatment. To put this in perspective, not even freerange operations keep pig behavior specialists onsite to spot hogs nearing ejaculation and pull them away in order to temporarily evade orgasm, thereby extending the hogs arousal and making their eventual climaxes that much more explosive. For a household meat brand like Oscar Mayer to endorse this kind of practice is a really, really big deal. Before slaughter, we intend to treat our pigs to nothing less than the absolute highest order of hoofshattering orgasms, said Oscar Mayer President Mark Magnesen in a press release. Our commitment to the wellbeing of animals means ensuring that no pig reaches an abbatoir without first experiencing a flesh romp so sensational it causes their numbing limbs to buckle under fullbodied tailtosnout pleasure. Just yes. Even PETA has to admit that this is a great new direction for pork producers. Taste tests held by the company revealed that customers unanimously preferred meat from sexually gratified pigs over meat from pigs raised under typical factoryfarm stresses. Interested in trying some yourself, or just want to support the cause Look for the special label theyve created to specify that their products came from a pig they made squeal in wanton rapture. Well, it looks like Oscar Mayer is finally getting on the right side of animal rights history. This is exactly the thoughtful kind of action consumers want to see food companies enact. They could have easily just asked suppliers to masturbate a few pigs to completion and called it change, but the level of care theyre pouring into these bacchanalian thrills shows that theyre truly making animal welfare a priority. Any progress for farm animals is welcome progress, and hopefully this is a sign of even better living conditions to come. One blowout circus of carnal delights is the least they can do for these pigs.",satire

"Email It only takes one misstep to ruin an applepicking trip for everyone. Why not brush up on these applepicking rules so you dont end up in the Punishment Orchard 1. Dont climb the trees Apple trees are for picking, not climbing Fail to heed this rule and you might just find yourself stuck in the cruel autumn shadow of the Punishment Orchard. Swinging from a tree branch in the regular orchard wont seem worth it once youre lashed to a hayride and dumped in the middle of this sprawling, 100acre wasteland where the fog never lifts and the apples are all way too hot to pick. 2. Twist, dont pull Heads up Pulling an apple can inadvertently knock down other fruit and risks damaging the tree. Better to carefully twist the apple upwards than be consigned to the Punishment Orchards sea of wet, beige trees with no end in sight. Keep this rule in mind and you will never get trapped in the pitchblack sap oozing out of all the trees, nor will you be driven mad by the winds that constantly whisper a summary of Dale Earnhardts death. 3. Dont waste fruit The stench of bleach and pennies will be the surefire sign that your decision to just toss imperfect apples onto the ground of the normal orchard has landed you in the wicked, seething grove of the Punishment Orchard. A chorus of middleaged men shrouded by crude scarecrow masks will taunt you with their vexing rhyme We are the men who have picked before / Your hands are bags, your days no more. Looking down, condemned travelers will realize the infectious verse has replaced their hands with reusable grocery bags and they can no longer remember important birthdays. 4. Dont eat the apples until youve paid Youll want to pay upfront if you dont want to wake up in the wicker prison at the base of the Tree of Despair, a beige monstrosity whose sprawling tendrils lie directly under the approach path of the regional airport. You must sit in your atonement basket while the depraved, orphaned children of the Punishment Orchard throw scalding apples at your head as part of one of their simpleminded religious rituals. 5. Dont pick outside the designated areas Follow the clearly posted signs in sunny and cheerful normal orchard and you should be fine Wanderers will have their names recorded on the Punishment Orchards Ledger of Bad Deeds, a shameful blight that nearly cost William Rehnquist his appointment to the Supreme Court in 1971. Then they will be given incorrect directions which will only send them deeper into the bowels of the Punishment Orchard, where the Cider Warden bathes himself in bleach and spare change. Even years after a stay in the Punishment Orchard, the smell of either of these items will send you into a vivid Vietnam flashback, regardless of whether or not you fought in Vietnam. 6. No running Its natural to let the excitement of apple picking get the best of you. Just dont be surprised if you draw the ire of the Punishment Picker. Setting aside his chisel and cigar, he will take an afternoon off from making sculptures of Mussolini having a great time in order to make a sculpture of you getting stung by a bee.

Paul is a retired firefighter, Ayesha is a law student. Paul has lived in the same suburb of Columbus for his entire life, Ayesha immigrated to Ohio from Pakistan when she was a teen. Paul is a devout Christian, Ayesha is Muslim. But if you dig a little deeper, youll find that they share a common bond Both Paul and Ayesha have Trump painted on their garages Beautiful Take a look at the sidebyside pictures above to see just how similar these two really are. When Donald Trump announced his campaign last summer, Paul knew he wanted to show his support by painting a large sign of the candidates name on his garage door. But Paul probably never would have guessed that one year later, just a few towns over from him, Ayeshas own garage would be painted with literally the exact same word Paul and Ayesha may be from totally different walks of life, but when it comes to the name currently painted on their garages, these two have more in common than they ever could have imagined. At the end of the day, it doesnt matter whether their skin is white or brown. It doesnt matter whether they worship God or Allah. And it doesnt matter whether the word Trump has been carefully lettered or hastily scrawled across the garage in brusque spray paint. All that matters is the commonality they share in having the word Trump painted on their homes for the entire neighborhood to see. Amazing It just goes to show, you should never judge a book by its cover. At a time when our country feels so divided, stories like this one give us hope for humanity. On the surface, Paul and Ayesha couldnt be more different, but the messages painted or spraypainted across their garages are one in the same.

Tears of Blood, Nuclear Bombardment Chile Extract, and Death on the Toilet have become standard fare in the hotsauce industry. An innocent trip to purchase a simple bottle of ketchup now subliminally exposes shoppers, and our impressionable children, to dozens of gruesome descriptions of burning flesh, brutal deaths, and massive ass damage. As soon as the hotsauce industry agreed it was okay to allow names like Cremation in a Bottle Pepper Sauce and Ass Grave Cajun Sauce to appear on store shelves, any shred of decency went out the window. An arms race began to see who could come up with the most violent and gory sauce name, society be damned. And it needs to stop before our children internalize these sorts of brutal names as the norm for hotsauce labels. Hot sauce has always been hot, but the names used to imply the hotness without going into the graphic detail you see today. I took my son James to my favorite Mexican restaurant this past weekend, and he didnt even blink when he saw a bottle with Volcanic Crucification written out in flames. If he isnt bothered by this, whos to say if he would even think twice if he one day saw a hot sauce called Ghost Pepper Throat Thresher I pray that we correct course in this country before anyone decides to make that hot sauce. It wasnt always like this. Hot sauce has always been hot, but the names used to imply the hotness without going into the graphic detail you see today. Names like Franks Red Hot let you know you were in for some serious heat, but left something to the imagination. But there is no longer a moral standard for hotsauce names. Now, all it takes to begin leading a child down a bad path is for them to glance at a sauce bottle in a friends refrigerator door. Whether its Screaming Suicide Moruga Scorpion Sauce or Habanero Holocaust Sauce, the lengths to which todays sauces are going to outdo one another with disturbingly violent names has gotten out of control. And if youre a parent, you know that we must do something to stop this, before its too late for our children.",satire
"Email Jane Goodall has dedicated her life to studying primates, and the insights she has gained into our evolutionary ancestors are truly powerful. Prepare to have your breath taken away by Dr. Goodalls words. 1. Chimps will betray their own to get their hands on Italian food As with all chimps, the ones I studied in Gombe were absolutely obsessed with Italian food and would go to extraordinary lengths to get their hands on some. One day, the troops alpha male, whom I called Goliath, managed to acquire a plate of linguine. Humphrey, a younger male, saw Goliaths linguine and became incredibly jealous. He offered to give Goliath his most prized possessiona vacant hornet nest that he enjoyed having sex within exchange for the linguine, but Goliath declined, as he already had a hornet nest of his own. Desperate to eat the linguine, Humphrey threw some pebbles to divert Goliaths attention, then snuck up behind him and ripped his head off, allowing him to take the Italian food from his superior. It was a gruesome yet utterly fascinating scene. 2. When chimpanzee communities encounter a Japanese researcher, they will try to put them in jail My colleague, Dr. Kiyoshi Yamamoto, discovered this when chimps dragged him from his tent in the middle of the night down to the local prison. The apes would then approach the towns sheriff with their hands out, expecting a food reward. It was truly shocking to learn that chimpanzees are capable of such things. Nature is not always pretty. 3. Most chimps can vocalize the phrase oh no They like to yell it while they defecate. 4. Chimps dont like it when you blow up one of their family members with a grenade One of my young researchers, Sofia Manfredi, discovered this after rolling an active grenade into a ditch where several male siblings were sharing a lunch of termites and soup. The grenade exploded the youngest one into a red mist of viscera and bone, and, curiously, the other brothers seemed to become rather disheartened. 5. Chimps revere hippos When they become aware of a hippo in the vicinity, chimps stop whatever theyre doing and take turns honoring the beast. They bring offerings of plump salamanders, crushed soda cans, and other treasures theyve found in the dirt, and they join together in an angelic chorus of growls to soothe the hippo. New mothers will rub their infants against the hippos groin to bless them with his virility. The troops elders will break off their incisors with a rock and fashion a crude crown of teeth for the hippo to wear. If the hippo becomes aggressive towards them, they do not resist in fact, it is an honor for them to be crushed by the hippo, and they will often place their heads on the ground next to his hooves in hopes that he might accidentally stomp their skulls flat. 6. If a chimp dunks its head into a bucket of horchata for an hour, it will die Whenever chimps discover a large pail of horchata in the forest, the eldest female of the group will approach it and slowly lower her head into the liquid, remaining there for an hour or more until another chimp yanks her out of it. It was fascinating to observe the way their social structure altered afterwards, with the next eldest female unfailingly rising up to lead the groups children in licking the sweet rice milk from their deceased matriarchs body.",satire
