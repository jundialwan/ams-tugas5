"EU Refugees wait to disembark from a ship on October 24, 2016, in Palermo, Italy. Photo by AFP More than 5,200 refugees have died across the world since the beginning of 2016, says the International Organization for Migration IOM. The organization, which is based in Geneva, said on Friday that of a total of 5,238 deaths, 3,930 people died trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea by boat, indicating a 170person increase compared to 2015. On Wednesday, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR made a different account with more than 3,800 deaths in the Mediterranean since January, also noting that it was a new record compared to 2015. Over 280 asylum seekers trying to reach the European Union died off the Libyan shores recently, according to the IOM. The EU said on Thursday it had begun training the Libyan coast guard how to curb the influx of asylum seekers. Today we are starting the training of the Libyan coast guard in Operation Sophia which is a very important step, said the EU foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini, as she arrived for a meeting with NATO defense ministers in Brussels. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the Western military alliance had just launched its own Operation Sea Guardian in the Mediterranean to help support Operation Sophia. The EU launched Operation Sophia last year after hundreds of asylum seekers died when their rickety boats sank off southern Italy. The central Mediterranean route has seen more asylum seekers risk their lives in recent months after the EU reached an accord with Turkey in March to halt an influx of refugees crossing the Aegean to reach Europe. Stoltenberg further said within two weeks ships and aircraft would be provided by NATO allies to help back up Operation Sophia. Loading ...",state
"Iran to resume gas exports to Turkey soon Fri Oct 28, 2016 1210PM Energy Iran says it will resume exports of natural gas to Turkey by Monday after an explosion in the Turkish territory halted the supplies on Thursday night. Iran says its exports of natural gas to Turkey that have been halted reportedly as a result of an explosion inside the Turkish territory will resume within the next few days. Sadeq Akbarpour, the head of Gas Exports Measurement Facilities at IranTurkey Border, told the domestic media that the required coordination is being carried out with the Turkish Botas company to resume Irans exports by next Monday. Akbarpour emphasized that Iran is ready to supply Turkey with its required gas whenever it voices its readiness. Majid Bojarzadeh, the spokesman of the National Iranian Gas Company NIGC, also told Irans Shana news agency that Ankara had informed Tehran of a problem in the pipeline that carried Iranian gas into Turkey on Thursday night. Furthermore, Majid Aqababaei, the director general for border affairs of Irans Interior Ministry, acknowledged, as reported by Shana, that an explosion near Irans border had caused the problem. Iran is Turkeys second supplier of gas after Russia, providing onefifth of the countrys consumption. The current volume of natural gas that Iran is piping to its northwestern neighbor is 30 million cubic meters per day mcm/d. Officials in Tehran had already emphasized that the Islamic Republic is ready to increase its gas exports to Turkey by 6 mcm/d. Iran has also for long been working on a plan to export its natural gas to Europe through Turkey. The plan  that was to be carried out though the Nabucco scheme  was eventually put on hold due to a series of technicalities. Nevertheless, officials in Tehran announced last month that the possibility that gas exports to Europe would return to the agenda exist if the requited agreements with Europeans countries over the plan are reached.

Photo by AFP The passing away of Thailands king has put the country into an uncertain state. The military junta, which has been in power after a coup, has announced one year of mourning. That will affect one of the largest industries in Thailand, namely tourism. Thailands economy was sluggish to begin with. Ever since the coup, retail business activity has experienced a slump, the agriculture industry has been hit with falling commodity prices, and exports, which accounts for 70 of Thailands GDP, has dropped five percentage points.

"Politics Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair says UK voters have to build the capability to mobilize and to organize against Brexit. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair says Britain should keep its options open on whether or not to leave the European Union until after Brexit talks with the bloc are completed. During an interview on Friday with BBC Radio 4s Today program, Blair described the EU referendum as a catastrophe and said UK voters should be given the option of a second EU referendum. Britain should not withdraw from the EU until it becomes clearer how Brexit would impact UKs economic, social and cultural future, Blair said. The bizarre thing about this referendum is that we took a decision but we still dont know the precise terms, he said. Theres got to be some way, either through parliament, or through an election, possibly through another referendum, that people express their view. The former premier, who was in office from 1997 until 2007, said it should be possible for the public to switch their verdict if it becomes clear the alternative negotiated by Prime Minister Theresa May is going to be worse. Blairs argument contrasts sharply with that of May, who has repeatedly said that Brexit means Brexit and that shell respect the referendum result. Blair had argued that Britain should stay in the EU before the referendum. Economic growth in the UK is expected to slow significantly next year, due to uncertainty over of the Brexit vote. Experts have warned that leaving the EU will severely hurt Londons position as a financial hub, unless the UK decides to keep its access to the single EU market by loosening its stance on immigration. If the UK loses its access to the EUs single market, the resulting increase in the costs of doing business and exporting to the EU would hurt Britains competitive position in Europe.

"Interviews A protester throws a glass bottle containing paint at a police armored personnel carrier during antiregime demos in the village of Sitra, south of Manama, February 14, 2016. Photo by Reuters The Fourth High Criminal Court of Bahrain has sentenced 15 political opponents to long jail terms and also revoked the citizenship of all of them. While several international rights groups have criticized the Al Khalifa regimes harsh crackdown on the Bahraini opposition, the Western powers turn a blind eye to the Arab states violations of human rights. Edward Corrigan, an international human rights lawyer, told Press TVs Top 5 program that the Western powers are trying to whitewash the crimes committed by the Arab dictatorships in the Persian Gulf region because such regimes are considered the Wests lap dogs. There is a double standard, Corrigan said, explaining that Western powers say, If you are a friend of ours and do what we want and give us oil and invest your money into European or American economy, we wont question your human rights violations. According to the analyst, There is hypocrisy, double standards and this is really a big political game. Our dictatorships and allies are OK but somebody else that we dont like for whatever reason, we magnify their crimes and even create false flags and do other things to try to discredit them. Elsewhere in his remarks, Corrigan said the definition of terrorism in Bahrain covers any kind of opposition, because the regime does not want to allow any sort of political movements there to try to reform the system, to redress this massive discrimination against the Shia population, and to have any sort of voice for democracy so, all of that is terrorism. He added, It is against the international law to remove peoples nationality from them and this is an extreme sort of punishment, very draconian, as theyre condemned by the international human rights organizations and other organizations. Manama has been cracking down on dissent since February 2011, when an uprising began against the regime. Scores of people have lost their lives and hundreds of others sustained injuries or got arrested as a result of Al Khalifah regimes harsh crackdown on antiregime activists. Loading ...",state
"Iraq Civilians leave their homes as Iraqi troops fight against Daesh militants in the village of Tob Zawa. Photo by AP Daesh terrorists have abducted tens of thousands of civilians from near Mosul to use them as human shields as government forces inch closer to the city proper in an operation to retake it, the UN says. UN human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said the terrorist group also killed at least 232 people on Wednesday, including 190 former Iraqi security forces and 40 civilians, who refused to obey its orders. Many of them who refused to comply were shot on the spot, Shamdasani said in Geneva, citing reports corroborated by the UN that were by no means comprehensive but indicative of violations. As the news emerged, Iraqs Hashd alShaabi volunteers said they were set to launch an offensive against Daesh west of Mosul imminently. Ahmad alAssadi, a spokesman for the popular forces, confirmed that the fighters had completed preparations to move in the direction of Tal Afar, a Daeshheld city 63 kilometers west of Mosul. He added that the fighters would move to capture Tal Afar from their positions in the Iraqi town of Qayyara, situated some 60 kilometers south of Mosul. A few days or hours separate us from the launch of operations there, Asadi said. Iraqi forces liberated three key areas from Daesh terrorists east of Mosul. Army officials said troops also seized a tank and artillery from the terrorists, and found a twokilometerlong tunnel full of ammunition. The army is edging closer to Mosul by liberating villages around the city. Nearly 80 Daeshheld towns and villages have been retaken by the army since the Iraqi forces began the battle to liberate Mosul last week. Loading ...",state
"Syria This file photo shows smoke rising from western Aleppo after militant shelling. At least 15 civilians are killed and some 100 others injured as foreignbacked militants shell western Aleppo after launching a massive offensive to break the Syrian governments siege over the city. A UKbased monitoring group sympathetic to the militants said hundreds of shells and rockets had fallen on various western neighborhoods of the city on Friday. Militant groups involved in the attack include Turkeybacked FSA and Jaish alFatah, an alliance of terrorist factions actively supported by Saudi Arabia and Turkey, they told news agencies. A senior militant said it was going to be a big battle with all the groups there participating. The attack appeared to have been mostly launched by militants from outside the city against government forces that hold its western districts, Reuters news agency reported. The socalled Syrian Observatory for Human Right said militants had set off several car bombs on the western edge of Aleppo after launching grad rockets at the citys Nairab airbase. Heavy militant bombardment, with more than 150 rockets and shells, struck districts on the southwest of the city, it said. The Syrian military said a militant attack in that area had been thwarted and the army had destroyed four car bombs. The massive assault by foreignbacked militants comes in the wake of a unilateral humanitarian pause declared by Syria and Russia in the city. On Thursday, the Russian Defense Ministry said aircraft had not carried out any sorties over Aleppo for the past nine days. There were no immediate indication on Friday whether the airstrikes had resumed. Militants used a USRussian ceasefire to break the siege in early August, opening up a new route into the city from the south, but government forces quickly closed it. The new civilian deaths came after at least six children were killed and over a dozen people injured after Takfiri terrorists launched rocket attacks on a school as well as a house in Aleppo.",state

Photo by AP Foreign ministers of Iran, Russia and Syria have started trilateral talks on a political solution to the Syria crisis besides a serious fight against the Takfiri terror groups operating in the Arab country. On Friday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and his Russian and Syrian counterparts, Sergei Lavrov and Walid Muallem, gathered in Moscow for a threeway meeting. Ahead of the meeting, Lavrov said the three nations are acting as a united front against terrorism, saying their talks are mainly focused on ways of seriously tackling terrorism, particularly in Syria. The three sides, Lavrov added, will exchange views on humanitarian operations as well as efforts to stop the flow of weapons and military equipment to the foreignbacked militants operating against the Damascus government. Prior to the threeway discussions, Zarif held a bilateral meeting with Lavrov to discuss regional issues and the further enhancement of bilateral TehranMoscow ties. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov R welcomes his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif during a meeting in Moscow on October 28, 2016. Photo by AFP Upon his arrival at Vnukovo International Airport in Moscow on Friday morning, Zarif said a political solution besides a serious fight against terrorism is the only way out of the crisis gripping Syria. Unfortunately, some countries have always pursued war and a military solution in Syria. This is while the solution to this crisis is of a political nature and also entails battles against Takfiri groups, said Zarif. He added, We have always emphasized the need for the establishment of an allout ceasefire, humanitarian operations and efforts to find a political solution to the Syrian issue. Following the trilateral talks, the three ministers attended a joint press conference. During the presser, Muallem slammed the USled coalition purportedly fighting Daesh, saying the alliance has never been fighting terrorism despite its claims. He said the Washingtonled campaign was in fact encouraging Daesh terrorists to move from Iraqs Mosul to Syrias Raqqah. Mosul and Raqqah have served as the main Daesh bases in the Middle East over the past years. Iraqi and Syrian armed forces are engaged in largescale military offensive to drive the terror group from the two cities. The Syrian foreign minister further said his country would continue cooperation with Iran and Russia in efforts to eradicate terrorism. Muallem described the atmosphere of the talks in Russia as positive and very comfortable. We in Syria have become convinced of the sincerity of the Russian and Iranian efforts in helping us rout terrorism, he added.

Commenting on the situation in Syria, the top Iranian diplomat said Syrias sovereignty and territorial integrity must be protected, adding that it is up to the Syrian nation to determine its own destiny and that the voice of the Syrians must be recognized. He further highlighted the need for a political settlement of the crisis, adding that Tehran backs the resumption of peace talks between the Syrian government and opposition. The Iranian minister called for a ceasefire in Syria, joint battles against terror groups as well as efforts to facilitate aid delivery to Syrian civilians in besieged areas. He said the global community must unite in the battle against terrorism, which poses a threat not only to Syria, but the entire world. Zarif added that supporting terrorism would serve the interest of no one, warning that the terror groups would eventually bite the hands that feed them. For his part, the Russian foreign minister also touched on the Mosul battle in Iraq, saying that Iraqi citys liberation from Daesh would have a significant impact on the balance of power in neighboring Syria. Lavrov said the political settlement in Syria should be achieved through dialogue according to the Security Council resolutions, welcoming Syrias readiness to resume the stalled talks with the opposition. Referring to the situation in Aleppo, Lavrov said terrorists blocked the exit routes opened as part of a Syrian humanitarian pause and prevented the civilians from leaving the eastern neighborhoods of Aleppo City. The senior Russian official also criticized the international organizations for failing to fulfill their duties towards the locals of eastern Aleppo. Lavrov emphasized that the fight against terrorism in Syria will continue, adding that future common steps in this regard during the Moscow talks. Loading ...",state

Clashes involving police have erupted in the Sudanese capital Khartoum as hundreds of people demonstrated in protest against the governments land policies. The peaceful protest turned violent after riot police fired tear gas canisters at the demonstrators in East Jreif district. Our land belongs to our ancestors and the government wants to give it to investors. We are protesting to save our land, a protester said, regretting that the government had shown no intention of compensating the land owners in case their property was seized. Some protesters pelted police officers and members of security forces with rocks. Others burned tires and tried to close off all the streets in East Jreif. Police had a heavy presence with reports saying that 15 trucks of riot policemen armed with batons were deployed in the area.

Photo by AFP Secret peace negotiations between Mozambiques opposition leader Afonso Dhlakama and EU mediators were annulled at the weekend after fighting erupted between the countrys army and former rebel fighters, local media say. The meeting aimed to contribute to talks that began in May to find a solution to the conflict between the government and Dhlakamas rebel group turned political party Renamo. We had agreed with President Filipe Nyusi that two mediators would come ... to meet me, the independent weekly Canal de Mocambique quoted Dhlakama as saying. Dhlakama said he had cancelled the meeting after the army increased its presence near the place of the meeting. There was a violent shootout. I even heard explosions from here, said Dhlakama, who has been in hiding in the central Gorongosa mountains since October 2015. So I called chief mediator Mario Raffaelli to tell him that armed forces had come to ambush me, he added. Dhlakama quoted the mediator as saying that he was convinced that the ruling Frelimo party wanted to capture me during the meeting. It is obvious they have a plan to kill me, he added. Raffaelli declined to comment on the matter but an EU diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed that two mediators had gone to Gorongosa for a meeting with the opposition leader. The diplomat said Dhlakama had told the mediators to turn back at the very last moment. The political situation in Mozambique has been tense for months with Dhlakama refusing to recognize the results of the 2014 elections, where the Frelimo party was declared the winner. The party has been in power since the southern African countrys independence from Portugal in 1975. Dhlakama also threatened to seize power by force in the northern half of the country. Renamo and the Frelimoled government had been engaged in a civil war for 16 years that was brought to an end in 1992. Renamos armed wing has conducted a string of fatal assaults in central Mozambique in recent years as it seeks to increase its share of power. On October 19, the warring sides resumed a new round of peace talks despite the killing of an opposition negotiator on October 9.

"Palestine The file photo shows a view of alAqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem alQuds. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization UNESCO has approved a motion that endorses the right of the Palestinians to the alAqsa Mosque compound and slams Israeli provocations around the holy site. UNESCOs 21member World Heritage Committee adopted the resolution in Wednesdays secret ballot at the agencys headquarters in Paris. Ten countries voted for, two against, eight abstained and one was absent in the voting. The resolution expresses UNESCOs deep concerns over Israeli construction works and archaeological excavations in the Old City of Jerusalem alQuds. Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, welcomed the passage of the motion and accused the Tel Aviv regime of resorting to a campaign of distorting facts in a bid to legitimize its occupation of East Jerusalem alQuds. Through an orchestrated campaign, Israel has been using archaeological claims and distortion of facts as a way to legitimize the annexation of occupied East Jerusalem, Erekat said. He further noted that the UNESCO resolution urges respecting the status quo of its religious sites, including the alAqsa Mosque compound that continues to be threatened by the systematic incitement and provocative actions of the Israeli government and extremist Jewish groups. Earlier this month, UNESCOs 58member Executive Board approved a similar resolution, prompting a furious reaction from Israel as the regime suspended its ties with the agency. Wednesdays vote further infuriated Israel, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announcing that the regimes ambassador to UNESCO, Carmel ShamaHacohen, had been recalled for consultations. We will decide what the next steps will be, Netanyahu said in a statement. Elias Sanbar, Palestines UNESCO envoy, fired back at those upset with the resolution and warned that Israelis were politicizing religion and this is very dangerous.

"Military British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon Photo by AFP British Defense Minister Michael Fallon says the UK is set to deploy hundreds of troops to the Baltic region in Europe to support its NATO allies in the face of a more assertive Russia. Fallon told a NATO ministerial meeting in Brussels on Wednesday that Britain would send 800 soldiers to Estonia to fulfill its pledge to deliver one of four battalions to NATOs Enhanced Forward Presence in Eastern Europe. Backed by a rising defense budget, this deployment of air, land and sea forces shows that we will continue to play a leading role in NATO, supporting the defense and security of our allies from the north to the south of the alliance, Fallon said. NATO had announced in July that it would deploy, on a rotational basis, four multinational battalions to Poland and the Baltic statesEstonia, Latvia and Lithuaniato deter what it referred to as any Russian incursion. During his address at the meeting, Fallon also said that four British Typhoon fighter jets would be dispatched to Romania under the NATO Southern Air Policing mission, which is supposed to protect the Baltic states airspace against possible attacks from Russia. This is about two things reassurance, and that needs to be done with some formidable presence, and deterrence, Fallon had said in an earlier interview. This is not simply a tripwire.This is a serious military presence. The move is likely to draw criticism from Moscow, which has been angered by NATOs military buildup on its Western borders. The USled military alliance cut its ties with Moscow in 2014 and has been reinforcing its presence near Russias borders ever since. The UK and Russia have strong disagreements over a number of issues, mainly the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine. The two countries military forces have been involved in a series of aerial and naval confrontations, with Britain sending its jets and warships on several occasions to intercept Russian bombers and naval fleets. The latest of those encounters occurred on Thursday, when the Russian aircraft career Admiral Kuznetsov and its sevenship task force were shadowed by two British warships on a course to sail through the North Sea and English Channel, on their way to Syria.

"Interviews James Clapper, Director of US National Intelligence Agency, speaks at the Council of Foreign Relations in New York City on October 25, 2016. AFP photo James Clapper, the US director of national intelligence, has warned that the establishment of a nofly zone in Syria could prompt Russia to shoot down US planes. This comes as Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for the 2016 US presidential election, has called for establishing a nofly zone in the Arab country. Russia has recently deployed mobile S400 and S300 missile batteries to western Syria, which are ready to shoot down cruise missiles and aircraft. Gordon Duff, a senior editor with the Veterans Today, told Press TV that James Clapper who spoke out against former secretary of states emphasis on a nofly zone over Syria is responsible, because the American officials obtain their intelligence on the Syrian conflict from the spy chief. The public position of the United States visvis Syria was established based on intelligence supplied exclusively by James Clapper, Duff noted, adding, He Clapper is the one that talks about the gas, hes the one who talks about the barrel bombs, and everything thats been disproven. He said, Every crazy scheme that the US comes up with to blame Syria for killing its own people or the Russians for slaughtering people in hospitals, it all comes from James Clapper, the director of the National Intelligence Agency, who fed that information to Secretary Clinton, who fed that information to President Barack Obama. Clinton said that she favored a nofly zone only if acceptable for both Russia and Damascus and after negotiations, which is a very different story than the one said by the spy chief for political purposes, Duff said. Duff added that the imposition of nofly zone obviously is going to help no one but alNusra Front and ISIS Daesh terrorists. Damascus and Moscow carry out airstrikes against terrorist groups who wreak havoc in the Arab country, but the US and its allies push for imposing a nofly zone on Syria to pursue their agenda in the warridden state.

Much more disturbing, and more difficult, is the rise in our own communities of anger and discontent, spilling over into violence and destructive protests, Gordhan said, adding, It is not just that our economic outlook is distressed, and there is the possibility of downgrades in credit ratings. Gordhans promise of spending cuts and fighting corruption has triggered a new political standoff in South Africa. He has been ordered to appear in court on November 2 to face charges of fraud in what many see as a direct clash between him and people loyal to President Jacob Zuma. The minister enjoys a good deal of public support over his record in office. Some senior members of Zumas African National Congress ANC have dismissed charges against Gordhan as politically motivated, calling on Zuma and the ANCs senior figures to resign to save the party from the current political turmoil.

"Yemen This still shows AbdulMalik alHouthi, the leader of Yemens Houthi Ansarullah movement, delivering a televised speech. file photo The leader of Yemens Houthi Ansarullah movement says Saudi Arabia commits crimes across the globe with the US green light. AbdulMalik alHouthi said on Wednesday that the Al Saud family has adopted a hypocritical approach in the Muslim world, the proof of which is Takfiri violence gripping the region. When Washington gives the Riyadh regime the green light, sedition sparks in all countries, with the Saudi offensive being in line with such a trend, he added. The Houthi leader also warned that Saudi Arabia is seeking to damage security in some Arab countries such as Egypt, Yemen, Syria and Iraq through petrodollars and deceptive propaganda works. Instead of countering the enemies of Islam, including the US and Israel, the kingdom has been engaged in spreading Takfiri ideology and arming terrorists, Houthi noted. Saudi has Yemenis blood on its hands On October 8, in one of the deadliest attacks Yemen, Saudi warplanes bombarded a funeral hall packed with mourners in Sanaa, killing over 140 people and injuring at least 525 others. Human Rights Watch, a New Yorkbased rights group, said that the Sanaa bombing constitutes an apparent war crime, while Amnesty International said the attack was a reminder of the need for the suspension of arms sales to Saudi Arabia. People inspect the aftermath of a Saudi airstrike in Sanaa, Yemen, October 8, 2016. Photo by AP Saudi Arabia committed crimes by the Sanaa attack, but it tried to acquit itself of the assault, Houthi said, adding that there was no clear sign suggesting an end to the Saudi offensive. He also stressed that Yemenis cannot rely on the United Nations as the world body has not adopted a position regarding the Saudi attack in Sanaa. Houthi further wished victory for the Palestinian nation and the resistance front in Lebanon and Syria as well as the Iraqi people in their antiterror operation in the city of Mosul. The Riyadh regime resumed its deadly airstrikes on Yemen on Sunday hours after a threeday truce in the conflictridden country expired. Yemen has seen almost daily military attacks by Saudi Arabia since late March 2015, with the UN putting the toll from the aggression at more than 10,000. The offensive was launched to crush the Houthi Ansarullah movement and its allies and reinstate the former Yemeni government.

"Hillary emails whitelisted for Obamas BlackBerry President could only receive messages from preapproved accounts Published 1 min ago Fox News President Obamas highsecurity BlackBerry used a special process known as whitelisting that only allowed it to take calls and messages from preapproved contacts, two former senior intelligence officials with knowledge of the setup told Fox News  pointing to the detail as further proof the White House knew Hillary Clintons private account was used for government business. As the administration now acknowledges, Obama and Clinton emailed each other while she was helming the State Department. If received on his BlackBerry, the whitelisting safeguard means Clinton and other contacts would have had to be approved as secure for data transmission  covering everything from emails to texts to phone calls. The Obama BlackBerry would have also been configured to accept the communications. Think of whitelisting like a bouncer in the VIP line at the party.

"By Tony Cartalucci Myanmars defacto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi of the National League for Democracy NDL political party, has paved her time since coming to power earlier this year with both irony and hypocrisy. She has not only illegally declared herself leader of the Southeast Asian state in contravention of its constitution, she has also embarked on an ironfisted purge of her political opponents identical to the one she fought against as she struggled to seize power to begin with. During elections earlier this year, Myanmars constitution prevented Suu Kyi from holding the nations highest office due to her inordinate amount of time overseas, her status of having been married to a foreign, and her childrens dual citizenship. Instead of adhering to the law, her party once in power, simply contrived an entirely new post for her, State Counsellor of Myanmar, which makes her the defacto leader of Myanmar. Canadas The Globe and Mail in an article titled, Stphane Dion says Aung San Suu Kyi is the de facto leader of Myanmar, would note that Canadas government recognized this legal sidestepping, stating Dion called Suu Kyi, now Myanmars foreign minister, the de facto national leader of her country because they have a strange rule that if you have married somebody whos not of the country, you cannot be the leader of the government and of the state. Suu Kyi, the internationally recognized democracy advocate, is barred from becoming president because her late husband was British, as are her two sons. The rule was crafted during Myanmars decades of military rule, which Suu Kyi fought against during years of house arrest before finally prevailing last fall. In essence, she is unelected, and illegally holding power. For a woman whos Western backers  particularly in the United States and United Kingdom  have held her up as a champion for democracy and the rule of law, she and her partys first act upon taking power was trampling both. The Inhumane Humanitarian Another myth built up around Nobel Peace Prize laureate Suu Kyi by the West has been her advocacy for human rights. Her advocacy for human rights, however, appears only to extend out to protect only as far as her immediate political allies are concerned. For groups beyond this selfserving political protection, and particularly regarding her political opponents, she and her NDL are just as eager to jail, crush, or kill political opponents as they claimed the ruling military government had been. In addition to escalating violence targeting the nations Rohingyas population, several activists online have been sent to jail for insulting the ruling government and Westernbacked media fronts and organizations. Myanmars Eleven Media Group EMG in its article, Facebook offender brought to court for insulting Suu Kyi, attempted to distance what Suu Kyi and her political supporters had once called draconian censorship as now, a simple matter of enforcing the law. It would state A Facebook user named Zaw Zaw aka Nga Pha was brought to the North Dagon Township court on October 24 to face prosecution for his defamatory posts about State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi. He has been charged under Section 66d of the Telecommunications Law. Hes being sued for defamatory writing and photos about the State Counsellor posted on Facebook, said plaintiff Nay Myo Kyaw, a 34yearold resident of North Okkalapa Township. Around 50 people showed up at the hearing wearing shirts affiliated with a group called the Network of Supporters of the Rule of Law. They shouted You deserved it for insulting a good person. The article also admits The Myawady Township Court sentenced Aung Win Hlaing aka A Nyar Thar, the first man to be prosecuted under the current government, for defamatory posts on Facebook about President Htin Kyaw, to nine months in jail after he was convicted under Section 66d of the Telecommunications Law. Aung Myint Tun aka Ko Pho Htaung, a member of the National League for Democracy, is still facing legal action under the same law for the wording of a resignation letter. Another man named Yar Pyay was arrested and is being prosecuted for creating a fake Facebook account under the name of Nay Myo Wai, the chairman of Peace and Diversity Party. Hla Phone was also arrested and is being prosecuted for defamatory posts on Facebook about the CommanderinChief. EMG  ironically awarded for its work in opposing the previous militaryled government by Reporters without Borders  would also admit that it itself had taken advantage of Myanmars laws to silence its own critics, claiming Eleven Media Group EMG also filed complaints about repeated defamatory posts on Facebook against the group. Though EMG lodged complaints against film director Mike Tee, who is the owner of a Facebook account named Than Tun Zaw, and another Facebook user named Myat Maw for offensive posts about the group and its staff, the legal process has yet to begin. EMG lodged the complaints on January 27 and March 31 this year. One would expect such a tidal wave of abuse  as defined by the West in regards to media, governance, and censorship around the world  to be met with sweeping condemnation from the Wests various human rights advocacy organizations including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and a no doubt embarrassed Reporters Without Borders  yet the silence is as deafening as it is telling. Taking Over Where Accused Dictators Left Off The Wests champions of democracy, rule of law, and human rights in Myanmar appears to have simply taken over right where Suu Kyi and her NDL party had claimed the militaryled government left off. And despite the overt nature of Suu Kyis breaches of Western standards of democracy and human rights, the US is on track to lift all sanctions from Myanmar as Suu Kyi and her government open the nation, its people, and its resources to exploitation by Western corporations. The overt nature of both the Wests and Suu Kyis hypocrisy illustrates that democracy, rule of law, and human rights are merely facades behind which the West and its proxies wield their power  hiding behind such principles rather than truly upholding them. And in reality, such behavior undermines these principles more than any overt abuse by an openly tyrannical regime ever could  because genuine advocates thus become associated with hypocrites like the Western governments supporting the current regime in Myanmar, their fauxnongovernmental organizations aiding and abetting the regime, and proxies like Suu Kyi and her NDL themselves. International audiences must keep this example of hypocrisy in mind as the West attempts to overturn other governments in Southeast Asia and beyond under similar pretexts and using similar rhetoric  supporting supposed prodemocracy and prohuman rights advocates who have every intention of trampling both upon seizing power.

"Prison Planet.com October 26, 2016 One of Norways nuclear reactors was discovered to be leaking radioactive iodine Monday morning, according to the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority NRPA. 1 In a statement released today, the NRPA said The radioactive leak was due to a technical failure during treatment of the fuel in the reactor hall. Emissions are low. Experts say contamination levels around the Institute for Energy Technology, in the southern town of Halden, were well within legal limits and posed no risk to the public. Said Per Strand, deputy directorgeneral at the NRPA, a government regulator Of course its an unfortunate situation but there is a low environmental risk. This is not the sort of leak we want. 2 The radioactive iodine was a byproduct of the uranium which powers the facility. Staff were evacuated from the institute, but later returned, donning protective gear, to assess the cause and extent of the leak, and halt it. A senior NRPA official said the incident would maybe be rated a 1 on the International Nuclear Event Scale, which rates nuclear incidents from 1 to 7. By comparison, the incidents at Fukishima and Chernobyl were ranked 7. 3 Source The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Regulatory officials were frustrated that they were not notified about the leak until today . Atle Valseth, a research director at the Institute for Energy Technology, agreed. He said I dont sit so close to those decisions but I think we should have informed the authority yesterday. We will have to go through why it wasnt reported  it wasnt good enough that we didnt report it yesterday. 2 Strand, the head of safety, preparedness and environment at the NRPA, expressed the regulators frustration. We need to gather more information  But we are not happy with the situation, that we were not warned immediately. We will investigate further. 3 The Swiss Radiation Safety Authority SRSA said i t has not detected any radiation emanating from the facility, which sits close to the Swiss border. Mark Foreman, a nuclear expert at the Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, stressed that the vast majority of the radioactive iodine is trapped inside the fuel, which is contained within a ceramic material. The ceramicwrapped material is stored inside a metal tube that is welded shut. The tube is inside the reactor. The iodine would have to leak out of the reactor to enter the reactor hall.

"102616 In September 2015, at the behest of its legitimate government, Russia began aerial operations to combat ISIS and alNusra terrorists in Syria. Numerous other likeminded groups are involved, just as cutthroat, just as ruthless, just as extremist, masquerading as moderate rebels when none exist  supported by Washington, NATO, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, other Gulf States, Jordan, Israel and Turkey.Theyre massacring civilians, killing government soldiers defending them, using chemical and other banned weapons, committing gruesome atrocities.Why does Russia pretend conflict is civil when Syria was invaded by terrorists, imported from scores of countries, serving as US imperial foot soldiers Why does it pretend moderate fighters are involved when none exist Why does it insist on separating nonexistent moderates from terrorist groups its combating when all antigovernment forces are the sameWhy isnt it targeting all armed groups wanting Assad toppled and Syrian sovereign independence destroyed Its the only way to free the country from the scourge its facing  supported by Washington and its rogue allies, NATO and regional ones.Why did it halt its aerial operations to liberate eastern Aleppo, declaring a unilateral ceasefire, a socalled humanitarian pause  a major blunder, accomplishing nothing Ongoing since October 18, its letting USsupported terrorists infesting the city replenish their ranks, regroup and mobilize for heavy attacks, largely harming civilians Moscow says it wants protected.Last Saturday evening, Russia ended its humanitarian pause because USsupported terrorists in eastern Aleppo prevent civilians from leaving, holding thousands hostage as human shields, including the sick and wounded.Yet it ceased aerial attacks, yielding the advantage to dark forces its sworn to eliminate. What kind of strategy gives them the upper hand It gets worse.On October 26, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman General Igor Konashenkov issued the following statementThe Russian Aerospace Forces and the Syrian Air Force have been sticking to a moratorium on air strikes for the past eight days. They are staying out of a 10km sixmile zone around Aleppo.Six humanitarian corridors, field kitchens and first aid stations are open for civilians leaving eastern Aleppo 24 hours a day.Russia and the Syrian government are ready to resume humanitarian pauses in Aleppo if they receive guarantees from international organizations confirming readiness to evacuate the sick and the wounded as well as civilian population from the rebelheld areas.Fact Maintaining an airstrike moratorium aids Washington, its rogue allies and terrorists in eastern Aleppo they support.Fact What good are humanitarian corridors if eastern Aleppo residents are prevented from using them, risking death or serious injury if they try.Fact International organizations have no control over terrorists in eastern Aleppo  or anywhere else in the country. So what good are their guarantees if madeFact As long as Russia continues making the same mistakes repeatedly, the struggle to liberate Syria will likely go on interminably without resolution  a forever war, while countless thousands more civilians will die, be seriously injured and endure hardships people in Western societies cant imagine, victims of US imperial ruthlessness.A handful of eastern Aleppo civilians alone escaped via a humanitarian corridor.

"David Brooks Whites are voting their gene pool after being ruined by globalization, immigration, and feminism November 7, 2016 at 109 am By Dr. Patrick Slattery On the PBS News Hour on Friday, David Brooks said white people are voting their gene pool. Wow. Just wow. This is the same David Brooks who wrote in his New York Times column about a Jewish woman who came up to him after a speech, and knowing that he was Jewish too told him that his speech was a description of how Jews had taken over America, which he acknowledged in the column was indeed the case.One of my Jewish professors once boasted that Jews earn like Episcopalians but vote like Puerto Ricans. In other words, they voted their gene pool. Of course, they eventually bought out the Republican party as well, which gave their gene pools vote a choice.Blacks famously vote their gene pool. Hispanics are expected to vote their gene pool. But when whites and whites alone consider their ethnic interests in voting, it is something that Brooks and the rest of the Zio elite and their Goyish lackey find deplorable. Basically, less educated or high schooleducated whites are going to Trump. It doesnt matter what the guy does. And collegeeducated going to Clinton. Sometimes, you get the sense that the campaign barely matters. People are just going with their gene pool and whatever it is. And that is one of the more depressing aspects of this race for me. But what Brooks said about the reasons for whites besides the collegeindoctrinated whites voting their gene pool was even more interesting. We had a lot of good things over the years that were really good for America. I think globalization has been really good for America. I think the influx of immigrants has been really good for America. Feminism has been really good for America. But there are a lot of people who used to be up in society, because of those three good things, are now down, a lot of high schooleducated white guys. And they have been displaced. When David Brooks was growing up, whites make up close to 90 of the American population. So it doesnt really make sense to say that the displacement of the bulk of the American population is good for America. Of course, he did specify high schooleducated white guys. Well, were blacks helped by globalization, immigration, and feminism What did that do for their employment rates, crime rates, illegitimacy rates, etc. And white women Well, maybe all they ever wanted in the first place was to have blue hair, nose rings, tattoos, and raise cats instead of babies. I guess we never asked them. And college educated white guys Well, they used to go to Harvard and Yale. Now, with affirmative action for blacks and Hispanics, competition from Asians, and massive Jewish nepotism, a white guy is lucky to get into a secondtier state school. Brooks conclusion was even more breath taking And shame on us for not paying attention to that and helping them out. And, therefore, as a result, what happened was, they were alienated, they got super cynical, because they really were being shafted. And so they react in an angry way. Well, thats not a shock, given the last 30 or 50 years of American history. And so, for us going forward, its to not reverse the dynamism of American society and the diversity. Its to pay attention to the people who are being ruined by it, and so this doesnt happen again. Here he admits that whites got shafted. That we are being ruined by diversity. But the weird thing is that line about so this doesnt happen again. What Is he concerned that Hispanics might be Jewed out of the America they inherit from whites The rest of his appearance was just a poetic rant against Donald Trump. With any luck, on Tuesday Trump will be elected president, and we can make begin the process of making America America again.",hate

"Brexit Ruling Just Latest Tactic to Block Will of the People November 3, 2016 Daniel Greenfield After the referendum made Brexit possible, I warned that the establishment would do everything possible to stop it. That should not come as a surprise to anyone. Brexit was very much a popular rebellion whose centers were well outside the centers of power. The establishment is culturally and politically hostile to it. And one of the most basic ways that the system has of sabotaging policies it doesnt like is to swamp them in procedural red tape and as much politicking as possible so as to make them unviable. Doing that to a Brexit is trickier, but its still happening. The same old game plan is to just bog it down as much as possible until its motive energy runs down. Its worked in the past. It may not work this time. But that wont stop them from trying. Rerun Brexit through Parliament and maximize the wrangling. The Courts ruling is certain to do that.

"FBI Wiretapped Corruption Suspect Discussing Clinton Deals November 3, 2016 Daniel Greenfield If youre wondering why Team Hillary panicked and unleashed hell on the FBI, this may be another ingredient in the stew. The Wall Street Journal article is clearly trying to spin things to the left and damage the credibility of the FBI, but its an interesting data point . The FBI had secretly recorded conversations of a suspect in a publiccorruption case talking about alleged deals the Clintons made, these people said. The agents listening to the recordings couldnt tell from the conversations if what the suspect was describing was accurate, but it was, they thought, worth checking out. Prosecutors thought the talk was hearsay and a weak basis to warrant aggressive tactics, like presenting evidence to a grand jury, because the person who was secretly recorded wasnt inside the Clinton Foundation. FBI investigators grew increasingly frustrated with resistance from the corruption prosecutors, and some executives at the bureau itself, to keep pursuing the case. As prosecutors rebuffed their requests to proceed more overtly, those Justice Department officials became more annoyed that the investigators didnt seem to understand or care about the instructions issued by their own bosses and prosecutors to act discreetly. In short, FBI people had material for a case that the government didnt want brought because Team Obama were Hillary backers and the senior leadership in the DOJ saw their careers linked to the rise of Hillary. And so a stand down order was handed down. Following the February meeting, officials at Justice Department headquarters sent a message to all the offices involved to stand down, a person familiar with the matter said. This is what happens when the DOJ has been so thoroughly corrupted from the top down. Meanwhile theres little doubt, considering what we already know, that the DOJ people had been updating Hillarys people on the FBI investigation. Should those emails come out, they will be some of the most damning of all. And so Hillarys people panicked and decided to pull the trigger.",hate
"Obamas DOJ Issued Stand Down Order on Clinton Foundation Investigation November 3, 2016 There have been various insider reports on the Clinton Foundation and the Hillary email scandal on FOX. But the curious thing about this Wall Street Journal report is that its clearly aimed at defending Hillary Clinton and smearing the FBI in the battle with Obamas DOJ officials who wanted to shut it down due to their support of Hillary Clinton. Which means that its information that damns its own side gains more credibility. Justice Department officials became increasingly frustrated that the agents seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions. Following the February meeting, officials at Justice Department headquarters sent a message to all the offices involved to stand down, a person familiar with the matter said. A stand down order. Much like the one in Libya. And remember McCabe, whose wifes Democratic political campaign received major cash from a Clinton ally Amid the internal fingerpointing on the Clinton Foundation matter, some have blamed the FBIs No. 2 official, deputy director Andrew McCabe, claiming he sought to stop agents from pursuing the case this summer. His defenders deny that, and say it was the Justice Department that kept pushing back on the investigation. Not a surprise either. The FBI had secretly recorded conversations of a suspect in a publiccorruption case talking about alleged deals the Clintons made, these people said. The agents listening to the recordings couldnt tell from the conversations if what the suspect was describing was accurate, but it was, they thought, worth checking out. FBI investigators grew increasingly frustrated with resistance from the corruption prosecutors, and some executives at the bureau itself, to keep pursuing the case. As prosecutors rebuffed their requests to proceed more overtly, those Justice Department officials became more annoyed that the investigators didnt seem to understand or care about the instructions issued by their own bosses and prosecutors to act discreetly. And thats what blew up when Team Hillary lashed out at the FBI. It was a covert war between Hillarys DOJ allies and the FBI coming out of the cold. And they pushed so hard even McCabe was disgusted. As a result of those complaints, these people said, a senior Justice Department official called the FBI deputy director, Mr. McCabe, on Aug. 12 to say the agents in New York seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions, these people said. The conversation was a tense one, they said, and at one point Mr. McCabe asked, Are you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation The senior Justice Department official replied Of course not. Of course.",hate
"When Stalinist monsters bestow their blessing. November 3, 2016 Humberto Fontova Its Hillarys hour...The only hope of defeating Donald Trump is Hillary Clintonthe difference between the two candidates is vast. Barack Obama did not exaggerate when he claimed that she was better prepared to be a U.S. President than even he wasor was her husband Bill Clinton. Stalinist Cubas KGBfounded and mentored media organ Cubadebate, Oct. 15, 2016. There was a day when winning a ringing endorsement from communist massmurdering, terror sponsors who craved and came within a whisker of nuking your nation would NOT be considered an asset for a U.S. Presidential candidate.  In any nation of the worldand even in the U.S. during normal timesDonald Trump would find himself either in prison or in a mental institution There was a day when being threatened with prison and torture even figuratively by an enemy Stalinist regime that jailed and tortured political prisoners many of them U.S. citizens at a higher rate than Stalin during the Great Terror would be considered an enormous asset for a U.S. Presidential candidate. But the ringing communist endorsement for Hillary Clinton gets even better  Hillary Clinton is our only hope of detaining barbarism So warns the eunuch scribe for a totalitarian regime that murdered more Cubans in its first three years in power than Hitler murdered Germans during his first six and in the process converted a highlycivilized, immigrantswamped nation into a slum/sewer with the Hemispheres highest suicide rate, which is ravaged by tropical diseases, where tens of thousands have died trying to escape, where alley cats constitute a delicacy and where oxcarts represent luxury transportation. On a few occasions Trump has even suggested the assassination of Hillary Clinton So warn the notorious assassins of suddenly inconvenient colleagues ranging from Camilo Cienfuegos to Tony De la Guardia to Manuel Barbarroja Pineiro. Yes, the Castro regime devoured its own children even more voraciously than even Lenin and Stalins. The news are dominated by revelationssome on videoshowing Trumps obscenity and male chauvinist conductalong with his treatment of women as sex objects So warns the Stalinist regime that jailed and tortured 35,150 Cuban women for political crimes, a totalitarian horror utterly unknown in the Western Hemisphere until the Castro brothers and Che Guevara took power. Some of these Cuban ladies suffered twice as long in Castros Gulag as Alexander Solzhenitsyn suffered in Stalins. Their prison conditions were described by former political prisoner Maritza Lugo. The punishment cells measure 3 feet wide by 6 feet long. The toilet consists of an 8 inch hole in the ground through which cockroaches and rats enter, especially in cool temperatures the rat come inside to seek the warmth of our bodies and we were often bitten. The suicide rate among women prisoners was very high. On Christmas Eve of 1961 a Cuban woman named Juana Diaz Figueroa spat in the face of the executioners who were binding and gagging her. Castro and Che Guevaras KGBtrained secret police had found her guilty of feeding and hiding bandits Cuban rednecks who took up arms to fight the Stalinist theft of their land to build Sovietstyle Kolkhozes. When the blast from Castroite firing squad demolished her face and torso Juana was six months pregnant. They started by beating us with twisted coils of electric cable, recalls former Cuba political prisoner Ezperanza Pena from exile today. I remember Teresita on the ground with all her lower ribs broken. Gladys had both her arms broken. Doris had her face cut up so badly from the beatings that when she tried to drink, water would pour out of her lacerated cheeks. On Mothers Day they allowed family visits, recalls Manuela Calvo from exile today. But as our mothers and sons and daughters were watching, we were beaten with rubber hoses and highpressure hoses were turned on us, knocking all of us the ground floor and rolling us around as the guards laughed and our lovedones screamed helplessly. When female guards couldnt handle us male guards were called in for more brutal beatings. I saw teenaged girls beaten savagely, their bones broken, their mouths bleeding , recalls Polita Grau. Thousands upon thousands of Cuban women have also drowned, died of thirst or have been eaten alive by sharks attempting to flee the regime founded by the folks who recently endorsed Hillary Clinton. This from a nation formerly richer than half the nations of Europe and deluged by immigrants from same. Remember how Donald Trump was taken greatly to task by the media for not quickly repudiating David Dukes socalled endorsement Well, we certainly look for the media to take Hillary Clinton similarly to task for not instantly repudiating the endorsement of massjailing, masstorturing, massmurdering Stalinists. After all, recalling the sticks and stones can break my bones riddle of our childhood, David Dukes crimes consist of words hatespeech. Whereas the literal sticks, stonesand chains, manacles, bullwhips and bulletsof the fine folks so enthusiastically endorsing Hillary Clinton have caused untold suffering to hundreds of thousands of people.",hate
"Whos really to blame for the corrupting influence of money in Washington, DC November 3, 2016 Walter Williams Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, having a net worth of 81.8 billion, and Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos, having a net worth of 70.4 billion, are the nations two richest men. They are at the top of the Forbes 400 list of Americas superrich individuals, people who have net worths of billions of dollars. Many see the rich as a danger. New York Times columnist Bob Herbert wrote, It doesnt really matter what ordinary people want. The wealthy call the tune, and the politicians dance. His colleague Paul Krugman wrote, On paper, were a onepersononevote nation in reality, were more than a bit of an oligarchy, in which a handful of wealthy people dominate. Its sentiments like these that have led me to wish there were a humane way to get rid of the rich. For without having the rich around to be whipping boys and distract our attention, we might be able to concentrate on whats best for the 99.9 percent of the rest of us. Lets look at the power of the rich. With all the money that Gates, Bezos and other superrich people have, what can they force you or me to do Can they condemn our houses to create space so that another individual can build an auto dealership or a casino parking lot Can they force us to pay money into the governmentrun  and doomed  Obamacare program Can they force us to bus our children to schools out of our neighborhood in the name of diversity Can they force us to buy our sugar from a highcost domestic producer rather than from a lowcost Caribbean producer The answer to all of these questions is a big fat no. You say, Williams, I dont understand. Let me be more explicit. Bill Gates cannot order you to enroll your child in another school in order to promote racial diversity. He has no power to condemn your house to make way for a casino parking lot. Unless our elected public officials grant them the power to rip us off, rich people have little power to force us to do anything. A lowly municipal clerk earning 50,000 a year has far more lifeanddeath power over us. It is that type of person to whom we must turn for permission to build a house, ply a trade, open a restaurant and do myriad other activities. Its government people, not rich people, who have the power to coerce us and rip us off. They have the power to make our lives miserable if we disobey. This coercive power goes a long way toward explaining legalized political corruption. Take just one of thousands of examples. The Fanjuls are among the biggest sugar cane growers, and they coown the worlds largest refining company, American Sugar Refining, which markets its product under the brand names Domino, CH, Redpath, Tate  Lyle and Florida Crystals. During the 2014 election cycle, Florida Crystals contributed more than 860,000 to candidates and political spending groups. It spent more than 1 million lobbying Congress, the U.S. departments of Agriculture and Commerce, and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Heres my question to you Do you think it forked over all that money to help our elected representatives uphold and defend the U.S. Constitution Nonsense. The Fanjuls and other sugar producers want Congress to use tariffs to keep foreignproduced sugar out of our country so they can reap the financial benefits from being able to charge Americans two to three times the world price of sugar. So heres the ultimate question If some rich people can line the pockets of politicians to do their bidding at the expense of the rest of us, whos to blame I think its we, the people, who are to blame for not using our votes to run such politicians out of town  and thats most of them. But that might be deceitful of us, for we also ask politicians to enable us to live at the expense of others.",hate
"David Frum Hillary is a Patriot Who Will Protect the Constitution November 3, 2016 Daniel Greenfield If David Frum had suggested that Hillary Clinton used to play for the Patriots, I would have found his argument a little more credible than claiming that she is a patriot. But she is a patriot. She will uphold the sovereignty and independence of the United States. She will defend allies. She will execute the laws with reasonable impartiality. She may bend some rules for her own and her supporters advantage. She will not outright defy legality altogether. Above all, she can govern herself the first indispensable qualification for governing others. This is under an Atlantic piece headlined, The Conservative Case for Hillary which also contends, Why support a candidate who rejects your preferences and offends your opinions Dont do it for herdo it for the republic, and the Constitution. The trouble with this line of argument is that Hillarys own agenda includes a rejection of the First and Second Amendment. Its a rather unusual way to support the Constitution by destroying it. Then theres the whole Hillary is a quarterback for the New England Patriots business. Who has ever accused Hillary Clinton of being a patriot How was this patriotism manifested In Benghazi In Iran In Russia Ill skip over the outright defy legality altogether argument. Though its certainly sad that this is now considered some sort of high water mark. But can Hillary govern herself Is the compulsive liar who cant help shouting, I was in New York on 9/11 really capable of governing herself I am voting to defend Americans profoundest shared commitment a commitment to norms and rules that today protect my rights under a president I dont favor, and that will tomorrow do the same service for you.

"Nigerian Novelist Wonders Why Everyone Loves Hillary November 3, 2016 Daniel Greenfield Why does everyone love Hillary Clinton Its hard to say. Her unfavorable ratings have hit 60. That makes her more popular than 1. The Bubonic Plague 2. ObamaCare 3. Osama bin Ladens corpse Its not much to go on. But the Atlantic decided to run a piece by Chimamanda Adichie titled,Why Is Hillary Clinton So Widely Loved Your response to seeing the name Chimamanda Adichie was probably huh. Unless youre a gender studies student at an Ivy. In which case you know exactly who she is and love her. Chimamanda Adichie is a Nigerian novelist whose We should all be feminists is big in those circles. The Clinton campaign is unbearably awkward and this panegyric by Adichie was an obvious attempt to channel some of that canned Obama poetry. And like most Hillary branding, it fails badly. There are howlers like, There are millions who admire the tapestry of Hillary Clintons past and There are people who, when Hillary Clinton becomes the first woman to be president of the United States, will weep from joy. Its not quite a hymn to Comrade Stalin. Nor is it getting there by any means except a tow truck. And then theres the phrasing. Oh the phrasing. Hillary Clinton was guilty immediately when she stepped into the view of the American public as the first lady of Arkansas. This is an awkward attempt to channel that Obama poetry, but instead it reads like a DVD manual badly translated from the Japanese. The Atlantic piece is full of lines that straddle the border between tineared propagandistic cliche and just bad writing. She was a lawyer full of dreams She was guilty of not being a traditional first lady. She offended the old patriarchal order. Then theres the theme of the article, which is to just deny reality. A conservative writer labeled her a congenital liar when she was first lady, and the label stuck because it was repeated over and overand it was a convenient label to harness misogyny. If she was a liar, then the hostility she engendered could not possibly be because she was a first lady who refused to be still and silent. Liar has reemerged during this election even though Politifact, a respected source of information about politicians, has certified that she is more honest than most politicians The perfect timing for that defense would have been not right after Hillary Clinton shouted at a rally that she had been in New York on 9/11. But dont worry. Hillary is more honest than most politicians. A site supporting her said so.  Other words have been repeated over and over, with no context, until they have begun to breathe and thrum with life. Especially emails. The press coverage of emails has become an unclear morass where emails must mean something terrible, if only because of how often it is invoked. How about Classified emails Or illegal server Or violation of regulations dealing with the handling of classified material Thats got lots of context. Or coverup. The people who love Hillary Clinton know that the IT system at the State Department is old and stodgy, nothing like a Blackberrys smooth whirl. Hillary Clinton was used to her Blackberry, and wanted to keep using it when she became secretary of state. People who love Hillary know that she love high tech Blackberry. Hillary love Blackberry. She is a lawyer full of dreams who fights for the children of migrant workers and loves their smooth whirl. Politifact thrums with life. Says her Blackberry is more honest than the iPhone. Hillary has many dreams of thrumming Blackberries whirling smoothly that offend the traditional stodgy patriarchal order IT system. The American conservative media saw an opportunity to blow the emails story out of proportion, soon followed, almost bashfully, by the rest of the American media Is that how it works in Nigeria Because thats not how it works in America. There is no objective basis on which to equate Hillary Clinton to her opponent. Theyre both mammals They need oxygen to live Theyre better writers than Chimamanda Adichie. The people who love Hillary Clinton see the failings of the general American media, where news entertains rather than informs. They bristle when benign stories about her are covered with an ominous tone They bristle and they hug their Blackberry and weep for they fear that the patriarchal stodgy IT systems will prevent Hillary from being the thrumming First Lady of North America. They know that she is a bit too careful, but they understand that she has to be, that she cannot afford spontaneity. You would think with all those six figure speeches, she could. afford a little her actions so falsely magnified, that she leaned into caution, wrapped herself in a kind of caution that sometimes makes her appear stilted  And wrapped in her caution, her whirling Blackberry in one hand, she bristled at the public, retracting her quills and occasionally hissing in an informed fashion for the children of migrant workers who admired the tapestry of her past. There are millions of Americans who do not have the selfindulgent expectation that a politician be perfect. They are frustrated that Hillary Clinton is allowed no complexity.

"Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. In the final stretch of the election, Hillary Rodham Clinton has gone to war with the FBI. The word unprecedented has been thrown around so often this election that it ought to be retired. But its still unprecedented for the nominee of a major political party to go war with the FBI. But thats exactly what Hillary and her people have done. Coma patients just waking up now and watching an hour of CNN from their hospital beds would assume that FBI Director James Comey is Hillarys opponent in this election. The FBI is under attack by everyone from Obama to CNN. Hillarys people have circulated a letter attacking Comey. There are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting Trump. It wouldnt be too surprising if the Clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the FBI. The FBIs leadership is being warned that the entire leftwing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after Hillary. And the FBIs credibility is being attacked by the media and the Democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton. The covert struggle between FBI agents and Obamas DOJ people has gone explosively public. The New York Times has compared Comey to J. Edgar Hoover. Its bizarre headline, James Comey Role Recalls Hoovers FBI, Fairly or Not practically admits up front that its spouting nonsense. The Boston Globe has published a column calling for Comeys resignation. Not to be outdone, Time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women. James Carville appeared on MSNBC to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane. He accused Comey of coordinating with House Republicans and the KGB. And you thought the vast right wing conspiracy was a stretch. Countless media stories charge Comey with violating procedure. Do you know whats a procedural violation Emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server. Senator Harry Reid has sent Comey a letter accusing him of violating the Hatch Act. The Hatch Act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of Obama as the Tenth Amendment. But the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the Wikipedia article on the Hatch Act under the table while accusing the FBI director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against Hillary ever. If James Comey is really out to hurt Hillary, he picked one hell of a strange way to do it. Not too long ago Democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave Hillary Clinton a pass in a prominent public statement. If he really were out to elect Trump by keeping the email scandal going, why did he trash the investigation Was he on the payroll of House Republicans and the KGB back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where Vladimir Putin and Paul Ryan talked him into taking a look at Anthony Weiners computer Either Comey is the most cunning FBI director that ever lived or hes just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a DOJ leadership whose political futures are tied to Hillarys victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs. The only truly mysterious thing is why Hillary and her associates decided to go to war with a respected Federal agency. Most Americans like the FBI while Hillary Clinton enjoys a 60 unfavorable rating. And its an interesting question. Hillarys old strategy was to lie and deny that the FBI even had a criminal investigation underway. Instead her associates insisted that it was a security review. The FBI corrected her and she shrugged it off. But the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the FBI. Pretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy, but it was a better one that picking a fight with the FBI while lunatic Clinton associates try to claim that the FBI is really the KGB. There are two possible explanations. Hillary Clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the FBI now that she believes that victory is near. The same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the FBI for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign. But the other explanation is that her people panicked. Going to war with the FBI is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign. Its an act of desperation. When a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the FBI, thats not hubris, its fear of what the FBI might be about to reveal about her. During the original FBI investigation, Hillary Clinton was confident that she could ride it out. And she had good reason for believing that. But that Hillary Clinton is gone. In her place is a paranoid wreck. Within a short space of time the positive Clinton campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the FBI. Theres only one reason for such bizarre behavior. The Clinton campaign has decided that an FBI investigation of the latest batch of emails poses a threat to its survival. And so its gone all in on fighting the FBI. Its an unprecedented step born of fear. Its hard to know whether that fear is justified. But the existence of that fear already tells us a whole lot. Clinton loyalists rigged the old investigation. They knew the outcome ahead of time as well as they knew the debate questions. Now suddenly they are no longer in control. And they are afraid. You can smell the fear. The FBI has wiretaps from the investigation of the Clinton Foundation. Its finding new emails all the time. And Clintonworld panicked. The spinmeisters of Clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire. All thats here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance. But this isnt how you react to smoke. Its how you respond to a fire. The misguided assault on the FBI tells us that Hillary Clinton and her allies are afraid of a revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup. The email setup was a preemptive cover up. The Clinton campaign has panicked badly out of the belief, right or wrong, that whatever crime the illegal setup was meant to cover up is at risk of being exposed. The Clintons have weathered countless scandals over the years. Whatever they are protecting this time around is bigger than the usual corruption, bribery, sexual assaults and abuses of power that have followed them around throughout the years. This is bigger and more damaging than any of the allegations that have already come out. And they dont want FBI investigators anywhere near it. The campaign against Comey is pure intimidation. Its also a warning. Any senior FBI people who value their careers are being warned to stay away. The Democrats are closing ranks around their nominee against the FBI. Its an ugly and unprecedented scene. It may also be their last stand. Hillary Clinton has awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandals in just this election cycle. But shes never shown fear or desperation before. Now that has changed. Whatever she is afraid of, it lies buried in her emails with Huma Abedin. And it can bring her down like nothing else has.

"European Media Jihad Against Geert Wilders As they lose their grip, the political and media elites are getting desperate. November 4, 2016 Robert Spencer The mainstream media in Western Europe and North America isnt even pretending to be an objective news source anymore instead, journalists are working openly to quell what looks increasingly, on both sides of the Atlantic, like a popular revolution against the hegemony of the selfappointed political and media aristocracy that seems hellbent on driving Western civilization over the cliff. And so its time for another round of their TwoMinutes Hate against Dutch politician and freedom fighter Geert Wilders. Wilders has yet again gone on trial in the Netherlands for hate speech, and this time the case against him is especially flimsy as Europe is roiled by the criminal activity of Muslim migrants, he is being accused of hate speech for saying that the massive influx of immigrants from Morocco from which most of the Muslim migrants in the Netherlands come has to be stopped. This trial could very easily backfire on the Dutch inquisitors, and make Wilders more popular than ever with the people of the Netherlands and Europe in general, as they are increasingly fed up with the political and media elites forcing them to accept a massive influx of Muslim migrants that ensures a future only of civil strife, bloodshed, and Sharia oppression. Consequently, those elites are trying desperately to shore up their position. Wilders chanted No more Moroccans at a rally. The horror To any sane person, this means Stop the influx of Moroccan immigrants who only inflate crime rates and welfare rolls. To the media, which at this point is quite insane, insofar as insanity means an inability or refusal to accept reality, this means Genocide And so, in this Deutsche Welle DW piece by freelance journalist Teri Schultz, were told that European Parliament lawmaker Cecile Kyenge, who was born in Congo, had numerous racial slurs  not to mention, bananas, literally  thrown at her, along with suggestions she go back to her country. Does this have anything to do with the crime and civil strife that are the foundations for Wilders position Of course not, but Wilders, Schultz tells us, is of course farright, that allpurpose and meaningless semaphore that serves only to signal to rightthinking Deutsche Welle readers that Wilders is, as far as the media elites are concerned, unsavory, and must be opposed and shunned, his positions left unexamined. Schultz contacted me to serve as the villain of her piece, being sure to tell her hapless readers that I am known for extreme antiIslam views, to make sure that if any of them are foolish enough to find themselves agreeing with me, they will immediately reverse themselves and get their minds right. The term extreme also, since the Western governing class unanimously refers to jihad terrorists as extremists, also implies that I am a terrorist. After the article came out, I challenged Schultz on this she replied I dont think even you would consider your views mainstream, do you I responded Absolutely yes. My views were the broad mainstream in the Western world from 632 AD until the 1960s. What changed Not Islamic teaching. To that she said Okay. Youd have to argue it with another expert, which I am not. But thanks again for contributing. Indeed, she is just a mouthpiece for the views the political and media elites want us to hold. In any case, Schultzs article merely reveals the desperation of the ruling class and the selfappointed opinionshapers. They can call those of us who wish to defend the people and culture of Europe and North America farright and extreme every day and they do, but the public can see with their eyes what is happening. Wilders popularity isnt growing because he is a charming fellow which is, of course, not to say that he isnt. Its growing because he speaks the truths that the political and media elites are in a frenzy to obscure. And its only going to get worse for them the Brexit vote and the Trump candidacy whether he wins or loses shows that their hegemony is beginning to be challenged. Those challenges will continue, and grow. They will before too long be decisively voted out and repudiated.",hate
"Obamas Weighs Options for His Final Stab at Israel In his twilight months in office, Obama seeks to undermine Americas closest ally. November 4, 2016 Ari Lieberman Israelis and the proIsrael community at large will breathe a collective sigh of relief when Obama leaves office. During Obamas tenure, relations with Israel were caustic at best. Barely five months after taking office, he publicly launched a scathing attack against Israel  where he perversely insinuated a moral equivalence between Israeli and Palestinian actions  and did so in one of the most virulently antiSemitic countries on the planet. He later skipped over Israel despite the fact that Israel was a mere 20minute plane ride away. That was Obamas opening salvo against Americas closest ally. It was only downhill from there. Obama utilized highlevel administration sources to leak negative information about Israel to sympathetic members of the press. In one such instance, an administration official probably Ben Rhodes  referred to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a  chickenSht . In another instance, Obama voiced concurrence with French president, Nicholas Sarkozy, when Sarkozy characterized Netanyahu as a  liar . Often, the Obama administration would subject Israeli dignitaries to humiliating treatment during official state visits. Israels defense minister, Moshe Yaalon, was shamefully transformed into a persona non grata. In the most notorious incident, Obama left Netanyahu out in the cold while having dinner with Michelle and his daughters. One commentator dryly noted that Obama treated Netanyahu as though he was the president of Equatorial Guinea. Ultimately, Obama crossed the line and received significant pushback from Democratic lawmakers and donors. Obama got the message and toned down the rhetoric but his deepseeded animus against Israel never dissipated and relations with Israels prime minister remained toxic. Tensions surfaced again during Israels counter insurgency campaign against the Gazabased terror group Hamas. Obama held up a shipment of Hellfire missiles to Israel and then tried to strongarm Israel into accepting a suicidal ceasefire agreement brokered by Turkey and Qatar, two despotic nations that support Hamas and gave aid and comfort to Islamic State terrorists. Obama saw Netanyahus opposition to the JCPOA, the socalled Iran deal, as a personal attack and allowed his petulant nature to further sour relations. The socalled settlements were another point of contention. Obama disregarded a letter of assurance to Israel provided by the Bush administration specifying that In light of new realities on the ground, including already existing major Israeli populations centers, it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949 Bush gave implicit recognition to existing settlement blocs and the right of Israel to build within those blocs. It is also important to note that no new settlement was created during Obamas term of office and Netanyahu had even agreed to an unprecedented 10month moratorium on construction within the disputed territories. But nothing was ever enough for Obama who never wasted an opportunity to excoriate Israel at every turn. His parting shot was at the United Nations General Assembly. During a recent address to that contemptible body, he explicitly singled out Israel for criticism but heaped praise on the xenophobic nation of Indonesia. Obamas moral compass had gone completely awry. Despite the fact that Obama is in his twilight months, he can still inflict immeasurable harm on Israel. According to a report featured in the Wall Street Journal , Obama is contemplating several options, each with significant negative implications for Israel. The report noted that he will only implement those options during the transitional period after November 8, so as not to harm Clintons presidential prospects. He may seek to remove tax exempt status for organizations supportive of Israeli communities living in East Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria. Perhaps more ominously, he may seek to impose dictates on Israel utilizing the U.N. Security Council. In one such scenario, Obama may seek to pass a resolution condemning settlement construction and declaring Israeli communities situated in Judea and Samaria to be illegal. Alternatively, the administration may seek formal recognition of the State of Palestine even though such a state has no formal boundaries and rejects Israels existence as a Jewish state. Lastly, he is said to be considering the possibility of setting up the parameters of a future peace agreement that would entail significant Israeli territorial concessions. The United States does not have to actively support any UNSC resolution to see the successful passage of antiIsraeli measures. It merely has to fail to exercise its veto powers. France, facing significant problems of its own in connection with its growing radicalized Muslim population, has historically been the fiercest advocate for the Palestinian Arabs. It is likely that the administration would seek to have the French submit a draft resolution and the United States would simply abstain while the permanent and nonpermanent members voted, thus guaranteeing passage. Israel has few friends on the Security Council and American collusion with a body that could arguably be considered todays greatest purveyors of antiSemitism, would be an act of extreme betrayal. It would also represent bad policy and would significantly complicate efforts to broker a future peace agreement. But Israel is not without recourse. There is strong bipartisan support for Israel in Congress and lawmakers from both sides of the political divide have already expressed to the White House their strong opposition to U.N. involvement. Some, like the Jerusalem Posts Caroline Glick, have suggested that the Israelis can reach out to the Russians with carrots in an effort to counter Obamas nefarious plans but this option seems to be a stretch. Moscow has always been in the pockets of the Muslim bloc and its recent vote at UNESCO in support of a resolution denying the Jewish nexus to Jerusalem, serves to reinforce this view. Moreover, even if Russia can be persuaded, relying on Putin for favors is akin to borrowing money from the Mafia and would come with a steep price. It is ironic that with the multitude of problems currently facing the administration  spiraling healthcare costs, racial discord, cyber breaches, Russias seizure of Crimea and eastern Ukraine, ISIS, the meltdown in the Arab world, Iranian terrorism, Chinas expansion into the South and East China Seas, the migrant crisis, immigration reform  Obama would choose to focus his negative energies on harming the Mideasts only democracy and Americas staunchest ally. That fact, in it of itself, speaks volumes about the man.",hate
"The president and Hillary Clinton share a stubborn desire to avoid scrutiny. November 4, 2016 Lloyd Billingsley The President of the United States, the most powerful man in the world, is working three shifts for his designated successor, former First Lady and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. As the FBI continues its investigations and Clinton emails continue to emerge, it is worth recalling the mysteries in the presidents narrative. Last year, Obamas narrator, as the New York Times called David Axelrod, released his massive Believer  My Forty Years in Politics . The author recalls a perfectly timed and unexpected call that would change his life. David, its Barack, said the voice on the phone. Im thinking about what I want to do next, and was wondering if we could talk. This call took place in 1992, which explains the perfect timing. On February 8, 1992, the presidents maternal grandfather Stanley Dunham passed away at 73. So Gramps, as the narrator called him, was no longer around to offer insights on family history, correct any accounts that might appear, or write one of his own. In the 1995 Dreams from My Father, Gramps might say that a Kenyan foreign student looks a lot like Nat King Cole. Actually, Gramps might not. The Kenyan student Barack H. Obama bears little resemblance to Cole, who passed away in 1965 but enjoyed a revival in the 1990s through daughter Natalies Unforgettable album. The narrator of Dreams from My Father invokes a stubborn desire to protect myself from scrutiny and he doesnt fault people their suspicions if they fail to take him at face value. His elusive father is a prop in someone elses narrative and an image I could alter on a whim or ignore when convenient. The narrative itself is a myth, a tale, and a useful fiction. Dreams from My Father has no photo section, no index, and key characters get only a first name. These include Frank, who gets 2,500 words. Back in 1995, the president himself identified this person as Frank Marshall Davis, the Stalinist Paul Kengor regards as the presidents mentor, as he explained in The Communist The Untold Story of Frank Marshall Davis . In Dreams from My Real Father , documentarian Joel Gilbert made a case that Davis is the presidents biological father. Malik Obama, son of the Kenyan Barack H. Obama, sees a strong physical resemblance . That also holds true on the policy side. Professor Kengor found remarkable similarities between the writings of Davis and the policies of president Barack Obama. The Kenyan Barack Obama, though a man of the left, was not a proSoviet Communist. Had he been proSoviet, he would have attended Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow. Indeed, Obama warned his fellow Kenyans about Soviet meddling in Africa. The Kenyan Obama would have found strange the presidents 2009 cancelation of missile defense for European allies. An outspoken man, he would not have supported the kind of hightech harassment Sharyl Attkisson described in Stonewalled My Fight for Truth Against the Forces of Obstruction, Intimidation and Harassment in Obamas Washington . The Kenyan Barack H. Obama had issues with strongman types such as Jomo Kenyatta, who ruled Kenya from 1963 until his death in 1978. In keeping with his country, and most of Africa, the Kenyan Barack Obama is not on record as a supporter of homosexual causes. Frank Marshall Davis, on the other hand, was certainly on board. As Davis wrote in his 1992 memoir Livin the Blues  During the dramatic civil rights demonstrations of the 1960s, I often thought we ought to form a united front with joint sitins at cafes. In my mind I envisioned the result. An indignant white restaurant manager frantically phoning the police, Get here in a hurry We got niggers at our counters and our washrooms are loaded with fairies and lesbians Or perhaps there might have been a joint March on Washington waving banners Blacks and Homos, Arise That, and Davis pornographic novel, Sex Rebel Black , might explain the presidents stubborn desire to protect himself from scrutiny. It could also have something do with what the narrator calls the less flattering aspects of my fathers character. In Dreams from My Father , the Kenyan is raised a Muslim but in The Audacity of Hope he is a confirmed atheist, thinking religion to be so much superstition, like the mumbojumbo of witch doctors that he had witnessed in the Kenyan villages of his youth. In Audacity , the narrator explains that he went to a predominantly Muslim school in Indonesia. He does not indicate whether atheists, Lutherans, Jews, or Buddhists also attended the school. Registration records were supposedly destroyed by flooding. The predominantly Muslim school also emerges in Believer , but Axelrod does not indicate if students of other faiths attended. Frank, Ann Dunham, Stanley Dunham, and even the Kenyan Barack Obama are missing from this account, but it proves enlightening in other ways. In a 2008, Brian Williams of MSNBC asked presidential candidates what steps they would take in the event of a simultaneous terror attack on major American cities. As Axelrod explains, Obama neglected to include that he would pursue the perpetrators. Hillary Clinton did likewise in 2012, passing off what she privately regarded as a terrorist attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi as a spontaneous protest over a video. Like the president, Clinton has always shown a stubborn desire to protect herself from scrutiny. With BleachBit , hammers and lies, Hillary and her handlers did their best to make more than 30,000 emails disappear. The contents remain something of a mystery, just as mysteries linger about the president and his background. On the other hand, by now some things are perfectly clear. The POTUS and former FLOTUS both decline to identify Islamic terrorism. Both are shrinkwrapped in statist superstition. And both lie with the greatest of ease. On these counts, like the critters in Orwells Animal Farm, one can find it impossible to say which was which. Back in July, the party faithful were chanting Four more years during the presidents speech at the Democratic National Convention.",hate
"Sometimes the road to diet change can be fun Ad 72890  HBS Account  2149237058061490 http//blogs.naturalnews.com/sometimesroaddietchangecanfun/ By Hesh Goldstein Posted Friday, October 28, 2016 at 0736am EDT When I was a kid, if I were told that Id be writing a book about diet and nutrition when I was older, I wouldve thought that whoever told me that was out of their mind. Living in Newark, New Jersey, my parents and I consumed anything and everything that had a face or a mother except for dead, rotting, pig bodies, although we did eat bacon as if all the other decomposing flesh bodies were somehow miraculously clean. Going through high school and college it was no different. In fact, my dietary change did not come until I was in my 30s. Just to put things in perspective, after I graduated from Weequahic High School and before going to Seton Hall University, I had a parttime job working for a butcher. I was the delivery guy and occasionally had to go to the slaughterhouse to pick up products for the store. Needless to say, I had no consciousness nor awareness, as change never came then, despite the horrors I witnessed on an almost daily basis. After graduating with a degree in accounting from Seton Hall, I eventually got married and moved to a town called Livingston. Livingston was basically a yuppie community where everyone was judged by the neighborhood they lived in and their income. To say it was a plastic community would be an understatement. Livingston and the shallowness finally got to me. I told my wife I was fed up and wanted to move. She made it clear she had to be near her friends and New York City. I finally got my act together and split for Colorado. I was living with a lady in Aspen at the end of 1974, when one day she said,  lets become vegetarians. I have no idea what possessed me to say it, but I said, okay At that point I went to the freezer and took out about 100 worth of frozen, dead body parts and gave them to a welfare mother who lived behind us. Well, everything was great for about a week or so, and then the chick split with another guy. So here I was, a vegetarian for a couple weeks, not really knowing what to do, how to cook, or basically how to prepare anything. For about a month, I was getting by on carrot sticks, celery sticks, and yogurt. Fortunately, when I went vegan in 1990, it was a simple and natural progression. Anyway, as I walked around Aspen town, I noticed a little vegetarian restaurant called, The Little Kitchen. Let me back up just a little bit. It was April of 1975, the snow was melting and the runoff of Ajax Mountain filled the streets full of kneedeep mud. Now, Aspen was great to ski in, but was a bummer to walk in when the snow was melting. I was ready to call it quits and I needed a warmer place. Ill elaborate on that in a minute. But right now, back to The Little Kitchen. Knowing that I was going to leave Aspen and basically a new vegetarian, I needed help. So, I cruised into the restaurant and told them my plight and asked them if they would teach me how to cook. I told them in return I would wash dishes and empty their trash. They then asked me what I did for a living and I told them I was an accountant. The owner said to me, Lets make a deal. You do our tax return and well feed you as well. So for the next couple of weeks I was doing their tax return, washing their dishes, emptying the trash, eating three squares a day and learning as much as I could. But, like I said, the mud was getting to me. So I picked up a travel book written by a guy named Foder. The name of the book was, Hawaii. Looking through the book I noticed that in Lahaina, on Maui, there was a little vegetarian restaurant called, Mr. Naturals. I decided right then and there that I would go to Lahaina and work at Mr. Naturals. To make a long story short, thats exactly what happened. So, Im working at Mr. Naturals and learning everything I can about my new dietary lifestyle  it was great. Every afternoon we would close for lunch at about 1 PM and go to the Sheraton Hotel in Kaanapali and play volleyball, while somebody stayed behind to prepare dinner. Since I was the new guy, and didnt really know how to cook, I never thought that I would be asked to stay behind to cook dinner. Well, one afternoon, thats exactly what happened it was my turn. That posed a problem for me because I was at the point where I finally knew how to boil water. I was desperate, clueless and basically up the creek without a paddle. Fortunately, there was a friend of mine sitting in the gazebo at the restaurant and I asked him if he knew how to cook. He said the only thing he knew how to cook was enchiladas. He said that his enchiladas were beanless and dairyless. I told him that I had no idea what an enchilada was or what he was talking about, but I needed him to show me because it was my turn to do the evening meal. Well, the guys came back from playing volleyball and Im asked what was for dinner. I told them enchiladas the owner wasnt thrilled. I told him that mine were beanless and dairyless. When he tried the enchilada he said it was incredible. Being the humble guy that I was, I smiled and said, You expected anything less It apparently was so good that it was the only item on the menu that we served twice a week. In fact, after about a week, we were selling five dozen every night we had them on the menu and people would walk around Lahaina broadcasting, enchiladas at Naturals tonight. I never had to cook anything else. A year later the restaurant closed, and somehow I gravitated to a little health food store in Wailuku. I never told anyone I was an accountant and basically relegated myself to being the truck driver. The guys who were running the health food store had friends in similar businesses and farms on many of the islands. I told them that if they could organize and form one company they could probably lock in the State. Thats when they found out I was an accountant and Down to Earth was born. Down to Earth became the largest natural food store chain in the islands, and I was their Chief Financial Officer and comanager of their biggest store for 13 years. In 1981, I started to do a weekly radio show to try and expose people to a vegetarian diet and get them away from killing innocent creatures. I still do that show today. I pay for my own airtime and have no sponsors to not compromise my honesty. One bit of a hassle was the fact that I was forced to get a Masters Degree in Nutrition to shut up all the MDs that would call in asking for my credentials. My doing this radio show enabled me, through endless research, to see the corruption that existed within the big food industries, the big pharmaceutical companies, the biotech industries and the government agencies. This information, unconscionable as it is, enabled me to realize how broken our health system is. I left Down to Earth in 1989, got nationally certified as a sports injury massage therapist and started traveling the world with a bunch of guys that were making a martial arts movie. After doing that for about four years I finally made it back to Honolulu and got a job as a massage therapist at the Honolulu Club, one of Hawaiis premier fitness clubs. It was there I met the love of my life who I have been with since 1998. She made me an offer I couldnt refuse. She said, If you want to be with me youve got to stop working on naked women. So, I went back into accounting and was the Chief Financial Officer of a large construction company for many years. Going back to my Newark days when I was an infant, I had no idea what a chicken or egg or fish or pig or cow was. My dietary blueprint was thrust upon me by my parents as theirs was thrust upon them by their parents. It was by the grace of God that I was able to put things in their proper perspective and improve my health and elevate my consciousness. The road that I started walking down in 1975 has finally led me to the point of writing my book, A Sane Diet For An Insane World. Hopefully, the information contained therein will be enlightening, motivating, and inspiring to encourage you to make different choices. Doing what we do out of conditioning is not always the best course to follow. I am hoping that by the grace of the many friends and personalities I have encountered along my path, you will have a better perspective of what road is the best road for you to travel on, not only for your health but your consciousness as well.

"Bundy Ranch occupiers acquitted on all counts after challenging the corrupt Bureau of Land Management Saturday, October 29, 2016 by J. D. Heyes Tags Ammon Bundy , Oregon ranchers , court decision NaturalNews In what freedom fighters across the country are calling a stunning victory against a tyrannical government agency, a jury in Oregon has acquitted all seven defendants involved in the armed takeover of a federal wildlife refuge in January.Cheers broke out in the Portland, Ore., federal courtroom when the jury announced the acquittals of Ammon Bundy, along with brother Ryan Bundy and five others, the Chicago Tribune reported .The seven were charged with conspiracy to impede federal workers from their jobs at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, which is located about 300 miles southeast of Portland. Also, the jury could not reach a verdict on even one count of theft for Ryan Bundy. Shocked by the acquittals The announcement by the jury did not come without additional drama, however. Upon hearing the jurys decision, Marcus Mumford, one of Ammon Bundys attorneys, demanded his client be released, even shouting at the judge. That prompted U.S. marshals to tackle Mumford to the ground and use a stun gun on him a number of times before arresting him, the Tribune reported.U.S. District Judge Anna Brown said she was not able to release Bundy because he faces federal charges in Nevada, his home state, related to an armed standoff with federal Bureau of Land Management agents at his father Cliven Bundys ranch in 2014 .As reported by KATU , the armed standoff began Jan. 2 and lasted nearly six weeks. The incident brought new attention to the longrunning issue of too much federal ownership of lands in the American West. The confrontations at the refuge earlier this year and on Cliven Bundys ranch in 2014 essentially reignited arguments between private citizens  mostly ranchers  and the federal government that stem from the socalled Sagebrush Rebellion in the late 1970s, when Western states like Nevada attempted to wrestle more control of their own territory from the federal government .As noted by The New York Times the federal government owns nearly half of the land  47 percent  in the West.The Tribune noted that even the defendants attorneys were shocked by the acquittals.Its stunning, said Robert Salisbury, an attorney for defendant Jeff Banta. Its a stunning victory for the defense. Im speechless.The U.S. Attorney in Oregon , Billy J. Williams, said in a statement that his office stood by its decision to prosecute the seven defendants.We strongly believe that this case needed to be brought before a Court, publicly tried, and decided by a jury, the statement said. When the jury hears the story, I expect the same result The Oregon case was, in a sense, an extension the tense standoff between federal officials with the BLM and other authorities, and the Bundys two years ago in Nevada. Cliven, Ammon and Ryan Bundy are all scheduled to go on trial for that standoff early next year.Its not clear what the outcome of the Nevada trial will be. Federal attorneys have said they dont feel like the outcome in Oregon will have any effect whatsoever on the Nevada trial.But defense attorneys involved in the Nevada trial arent so sure. Daniel Hill, an attorney for Ammon Bundy , says the Oregon acquittal bodes well for his client and the other defendants, all of whom are facing felony weapon, conspiracy and other charges, the Tribune reported.When the jury hears the whole story, he told The Associated Press , I expect the same result.

"Herbal tea can help with indigestion and insomnia Saturday, October 29, 2016 by David Gutierrez, staff writer Tags herbal tea , sleep , digestion NaturalNews Drinking herbal tea is one of the easiest ways to treat a variety of common health complaints, including indigestion and insomnia. By learning the uses of a handful of medicinal herbs , you can take charge of your health and improve your quality of life.Since they are so easy to prepare and use, herbal teas are among the keystones of natural medicine .We use a lot of teas to help deliver the health benefits of the herbs, says Stephanie Caley of the National Institute of Medical Herbalists NIMH.While you can purchase premade tea bags for many of the herbs below, you can also make them yourself.Once you find herbs you like that work for you, its nice to make your own blends from fresh or dried herbs, says nutritionist Amanda Hamilton.Youll get multiple benefits from the different herbs as well as creating lovely flavours. Teas for digestion Everyone gets indigestion sometimes, so it can be helpful to have a handful of herbal remedies on hand to provide fast relief. According to Caley, her favorite herbs for gut upsets include chamomile, cardamom, ginger and peppermint.Chamomile functions as both an antispasmodic relaxing the gut and antiinflammatory, thus providing broadspectrum digestive relief. Ginger is particularly good for nausea, a benefit that has been proven in scientific studies. Peppermint is also an antispasmodic, and is so effective that it is sometimes prescribed by doctors as a treatment for irritable bowel syndrome. Cardamom pods should be crushed before steeping, for relief of indigestion and flatulence.Another digestionpromoting herbal tea , not mentioned by Caley, is rooibos. Rooibos calms the digestive system, perhaps due to its high content of the antiinflammatory quercetin. Ease your mind, improve your sleep Another common complaint is trouble sleeping, which in severe cases may qualify as clinical insomnia. Yet many people who suffer from insomnia do not want to turn to potent and dangerous pharmaceutical drugs. For these people, Caley recommends chamomile, Valerian root, skullcap and lime flowers.Just as chamomile relaxes the gut, it has a tendency to relax the entire body and the mind as well. Caley particularly recommends it as a bedtime drink for anxious people, as well as for children, who tend to like its mildly sweet flavor. She recommends skullcap for people who tend to be kept awake by a mind thats racing.Use of Valerian root as a sleep promoter has a long history in herbal medicine, and the practice now has some scientific backing as well. A 2002 metaanalysis of 18 studies found that Valerian root is an effective sleep promoter hypnotic, with few side effects. It is now sold overthecounter in Norway as a sleep aid.Less well known are lime flowers, which Caley describes as very calming. She notes that some of the volatile oils in lime flowers are believed to bind to the same receptors in the brain as pharmaceutical tranquilizers in the benzodiazepine family.Another remedy, not mentioned by Caley, is the popular beer ingredient hops. Hops is known to promote sleep and to ease stress and anxiety. Other medicinal benefits of hops include easing indigestion, headaches and fever.Another herb that can reduce stress and promote sleep if taken at bedtime is Withanian somnifera , also known as ashwagandha or winter cherry.Other natural ways to relieve insomnia include getting more exercise, improving your diet and avoiding looking at screens too close to bedtime.Of course, herbal teas can do more for you than just improving your digestion and sleep. Herbs such as nettle and ginseng can boost your energy levels without caffeine, while chamomile, peppermint, lavender, rose petals and lemon balm can all help balance your mood and relieve stress, anxiety and depression.

"Study Running linked to extended lifespan and brain repair Saturday, October 29, 2016 by Amy Goodrich Tags running , brain repair , longevity NaturalNews We dont have to be scientists to know that exercise is good for us. However, researchers at the Ottawa Hospital and the University of Ottawa in Canada have added another item to the long list of potential health benefits of regular exercise. They found that running triggers a particular molecule called VGF, a nerve growth factor that can help repair brain and nerve damage in mice with an unusually small cerebellum and a shorter lifespan. The cerebellum is the part of the brain important for balance and coordination.Although more research will be needed to determine how the healing process would work in a human brain, the Canadian researchers are hopeful that their groundbreaking discovery may open new doors in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Put on those running shoes and extend your life In the study, published in the scientific journal Cell Reports , the researchers reported that VGF production induced by running in a wheel extended the life of mice with smaller cerebellums and difficulties in walking. Typically these mice only lived for 25 to 40 days, but when they were allowed to run, they lived for over a year , which is the normal lifespan for a mouse.Furthermore, they discovered that the running mice had a better sense of balance, and showed increased levels of myelin production. Myelin plays a key role in a healthy brain . It is the insulating material of our nerves, and is best compared to the plastic material around electrical cables. Lose that protective layer and nerves will have difficulty carrying their messages as quickly or efficiently, resulting in a host of neurological issues.While running improved the quality and quantity of life for the mice, they had to maintain their healthy running habit. Once the opportunity to exercise was taken away, they began to degenerate again and their lifespans shortened once more. The positive effects of regular exercise Dr. Picketts, a senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital and professor at the University of Ottawa, said that these findings shine a new light on the effect exercise might have on people suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, like multiple sclerosis MS, that involve a loss of myelin or insulation of the nerve fibers.With multiple sclerosis, you get a lot of degeneration of the neuron insulation, and patients with MS go through these relapses and remissions, Picketts said. Were really hoping that maybe if we could use VGF to limit the number of degenerations, it would really allow remissions to be more prevalent and longer, he added.Last month, another study published in the journal Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair , showed that exercise helped gerbils who had a stroke to recover their memory, partly though myelin repair around the neurons.However, when Dr. Picketts and his colleagues analyzed myelin levels in healthy mice, running didnt seem to produce any significant change. These findings suggest that VGFtriggered myelin repair probably only kicks in when our brain or nerves are under attack.Generally, healthy people already have normal levels of myelin, noted Dr. Matias AlvarezSaavedra, lead author of the study.Of course, that doesnt mean healthy people should not exercise. Many studies have linked regular exercise to healthy brain changes such as improved memory, increased blood flow and decreased inflammation in the brain. Sources for this article include",junksci
"Fast food combo meals tied to kids overconsumption of highcalorie drinks Saturday, October 29, 2016 by Isabelle Z. Tags fast food , obesity , children NaturalNews Fast food chains know how to squeeze every last dollar out of their customers. From decorating their establishments with appetitestimulating colors, to pricing their meals to encourage people to get bigger sizes, their every move is perfectly calculated to maximize profits. Unfortunately, these practices are hurting a lot more than just your wallet  they are also affecting the health of your children.A study led by researchers from the NYU Langone Medical Center found that children who ate at any of five fast food chains consumed an average of 179 more calories when their meals came with soda, juice, sweetened tea or flavored milk, when compared to those who drank unsweetened beverages with their meals.The researchers also discovered that the children consumed an average of 82 more drink calories when the drinks were part of bundled meals than when the drinks were bought separately. Moreover, parents who bought a combo meal were 24 percent more likely to buy a highcalorie drink sweetened with sugar.The study looked at almost 500 children aged 18 and younger who ate food from McDonalds, KFC, Burger King, Subway or Wendys in New York and New Jersey between January 2013 and June 2014. Seventyfour percent of the combo meals purchased were kids meals. Half of the drinks were sodas , and 38 percent of them were juice, with flavored milk making up 5 percent. A further 5 percent was made up of lemonade, sweetened tea and hot chocolate. Nonsugary drinks proved to be quite unpopular, with regular milk accounting for just 2 percent and water a measly 1 percent.Dr. Brian Elbel of NYU Langone, the studys senior investigator, said Our study strongly suggests that uncoupling sugary drinks from combo meal deals might reduce highcalorie beverage consumption and help to curb childhood obesity rates fueled by these kinds of liquid calories. Parents need to take responsibility Combo meals tend to appeal to big families, which can find their bills quickly adding up at fast food restaurants. Wellmeaning parents who might not normally allow their children to drink sugary beverages sometimes find themselves giving in when the drink is included.Although the practice on the part of fast food chains of bundling unhealthy foods together to create perceived value encourage unhealthy habits, it is ultimately up to the parents to decide which meals to buy for their children. Parents have the final say, and just because that supersized Coke comes with your childs meal does not mean that you should let them drink it. Fast track to diabetes Fast food meals are already high in calories, which means that the last thing you should be doing is pairing them with highcalorie beverages. Research published in the journal Diabetes Care showed that drinking even just one sugary beverage each day raised a persons risk of developing type 2 diabetes by as much as 25 percent. It also upped the risk of developing metabolic syndrome by 20 percent.With around 17 percent of our nations youth believed to be obese, there is an urgent need for poor eating habits to be curbed. Until people start giving up the convenience of the local drivethrough and start making a concerted effort to feed their children clean food , the situation is only likely to get worse, and more and more children will end up obese or diabetic.So, the next time youre thinking of ordering that combo meal, keep in mind that any money that you might save on a meal deal is likely to end up costing far more in medical bills down the road.

"Zika a masterpiece of public mind control Saturday, October 29, 2016 by Natural News Editors Tags Zika , mind control , propaganda NaturalNews Its been nearly nine months since the word Zika flashed like a lightning bolt in the headlines of mainstream news. Before January 1, 2016, Zika was just one of many viruses that public health officials monitored. But suddenly in January of this year everything changed, as a nearly harmless virus was transformed into a worldwide threat.Article by John P. Thomas, republished from HealthImpactNews.com As we will see, the Zika propaganda machine was turned on in October of 2015 and it has been running wild ever since. This is a classic example of a mind control program, a public brainwashing project, or a high powered marketing campaign.Regardless of what you call it, it is clear that the mainstream news media, the World Health Organization WHO, the Pan American Health Organization PAHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC, Big Pharma, Big Chem, and both Republicans and Democrats have joined forces to sell a Zika eradication program to the people of the United States and to the rest of the world.This has been and continues to be one of the best orchestrated programs of propaganda in recent history. This article will discuss how the program started, how it has been developed, and where it is going. Zika is not a Threat to the Babies of the World Just to be absolutely clear from the beginning, there is no solid evidence that Zika is a threat to humanity. It is a minimally dangerous viral infection, which does not cause microcephaly.In the almost 70 years since the Zika virus was patented by the Rockefeller Foundation, 1 no one ever noticed any association between Zika infection of pregnant women and their babies being born with abnormally small heads or with defects in brain development. But in 2015, we were suddenly made aware of this supposed problem. This claim, based on nothing more than circumstantial evidence, was the beginning point for the propaganda campaign. A propaganda claim doesnt need to be true it just needs to be repeated over and over again until people believe it is true.After half a year of fear and hysteria in the mainstream media, even officials in Brazil admit that Zika is an unlikely cause of their microcephaly .As reported in Nature News  Comment on July 23, 2016, an official from Brazils ministry of health raises doubts to suggest Zika is not the only factor in the reported microcephaly surge in his country. The report stated Zika virus has spread throughout Brazil, but extremely high rates of microcephaly have been reported only in the countrys northeast. Although evidence suggests that Zika can cause microcephaly, the clustering pattern hints that other environmental, socioeconomic or biological factors could be at play. We suspect that something more than Zika virus is causing the high intensity and severity of cases, says Fatima Marinho, director of information and health analysis at Brazils ministry of health. If that turns out to be true, it could change researchers assessment of the risk that Zika poses to pregnant women and their children. 2 Despite this admission from Brazil, the Zika propaganda campaign is moving ahead without interruption. The campaign will not be stopped by contrary evidence about Zika and microcephaly. Zika is a Mild Viral Infection Most people who get Zika, will be completely unaware of being infected. For those who do get sick, it is similar in many ways to having a cold or a mild case of the flu. People experience fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis. The illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting from several days to a week. Infection is thought to provide lifelong immunity. Severe disease requiring hospitalization is uncommon. Deaths are rare. 3The fact that almost no one dies from Zika infection made it a very unlikely candidate for the development of a vaccine. For those who actually feel sick from a Zika infection, they can receive comfort care and rest while their immune systems overcome the viral illness. Zika Press Releases Set the Stage for a Propaganda Campaign However, if Zika could be connected to some other horrible consequence, such as microcephaly or paralysis GuillainBarre syndrome for example, then people would insist that we create a Zika vaccine and would insist that every person on planet Earth take it. They would be willing to give up basic individual freedoms for the benefit of society, which is always the goal of mind control programs.In 2015, a number of press releases and reports were released by the Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization PAHO/WHO and the CDC, to set the stage for the unfolding of a grand mind control project.The documents they published raised the red flag of alarm that a Zika epidemic was unfolding throughout South America and Mexico. The conventional media got excited about the epidemic when they saw the word microcephaly. The prospect of large numbers of babies being born with abnormally small heads and brains was a story that would really grab the attention of their audience.The media used pictures of deformed babies to build fear in the hearts of people and to create the perception that we better watch out or Zika is going to get us and our babies They worked really hard to instill public panic about Zika in January and February of 2016 .In the timeline that follows, you will see the word autochthonous. Public Health agencies use the word autochthonous to say that an infection was locally generated. An autochthonous case of Zika is one that was acquired in the local area where a person lives. This is in contrast with a Zika infection that was acquired while visiting another region or country.I will list a few of the key points from some press releases to show how a foundation for the Zika campaign was built and how momentum was established to project the campaign into mainstream media. May 2015 Brazil confirms first autochthonous cases of Zika. 4 October 2015 Columbia confirms first autochthonous cases of Zika. 5 October 2015 Brazil reports unusually high number of babies with microcephaly. 6 November 2015 El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Paraguay, Suriname, and Venezuela report autochthonous Zika infection. 7 November 17, 2015 WHO calls upon member states to watch for the occurrence of microcephaly. 8 December 1, 2015 PAHO/WHO issued the first of dozens of reports, which chronicled the history of the growing Zika epidemic and warned of microcephaly. 9, 10 December 21, 2015 WHO reports autochthonous Zika infections in Honduras. 11 December 22, 2015 WHO reports autochthonous Zika infections in Panama. 12 December 31, 2015 US CDC reports autochthonous Zika infections in Puerto Rico, and makes note of microcephaly in Brazil. 13 Counting Babies with Microcephaly The mainstream media suddenly picked up on the Zika/microcephaly story in January of 2016 and began sensationalizing it. General concern was quickly transformed into alarm as officials in Brazil reported a steady increase in the number of microcephaly cases. As of January 30, 2016, they reported 4,783 cases of microcephaly and/or Central Nervous System CNS malformation suggestive of congenital infection. They compared this with 2001  2014 data where there was an average of 163 microcephaly cases. 14The Brazil data about the babies was poor. We didnt know their definition of microcephaly. We didnt know how many of the mothers actually tested positive for Zika. We didnt know how the data was collected. We also didnt know why there was a strong level of insistence that the only thing that could cause these birth defects was infection with the Zika virus. Propaganda campaigns always dismissed other viewpoints other than the one being promoted. They dont want an investigation of truth or a debate about the facts  they just want belief and submission. The US Propaganda Machine Goes Public in January 2016 CDC officials begin to ponder the situation. First they say there might be an association between Zika and microcephaly, but they are far from asserting any kind of causative relationship. 15Good for them, I thought when I heard that report. But their apparent wisdom took a nosedive a minute later when the same CDC official went on to issue a travel warning to women to avoid traveling to Brazil and other South American countries if they are pregnant, think they might be pregnant or are thinking of becoming pregnant in the next couple years.What did the CDC just say There is no evidence of causation, and we dont even know there is even a problem, but women should stay home any way. Strange, I thought as I began to remember how the conventional media, the CDC, and the WHO hyped up the African Ebola epidemic in a similar kind of propaganda campaign just 18 months earlier. The worldwide threat of Ebola Zaire completely died out long before a vaccine could be developed, which must have been a major disappointment to Big Pharma.But this time, they have a virus that is not going to die out. This time their propaganda campaign will be much more sophisticated, and it will make major steps toward the acceptance of universal mandatory vaccination for diseases such as Zika. A False International Crisis Involving Deformed Babies Justifies Action All through January and early February of 2016, the news media provided us with a nonstop litany of stories about Zika and deformed babies. In a previous article I examined some of the headlines in the propaganda campaign.The CDC was still using the word possible association, while the news media insisted on using the word cause. Despite the initial reserve of the CDC, the news media began to shout the message across America, Zika is going to deform the heads of our babies while they are in the womb, and theres no vaccine to protect usIt seems like every Zika story I saw included at least one photo of a baby with microcephaly and always stated that there is no vaccine yet. We were reminded over and over again that Zika is causing babies to be born with abnormally small heads, mental retardation, and blindness. We were warned that some babies were dying at birth because of the severity of their brain deformation. We were told that each baby born with microcephaly will cost ten million dollars or more in medical expenses during the childs life. 16 These stories created ever increasing levels of apprehension and fear as they were intended to do.As the mainstream media struggled to keep the fear level high and keep the story line flowing from week to week, they began to focus in on government efforts to save us from Zika. It didnt take long for them to find people to interview who would ask the question they wanted asked. What is the Government Going to Do to Protect Our Babies This question was asked over and over again even though there was no proof that Zika infection and microcephaly were related. The question was asked so many times by the media that no politician could dare to say, I am not going to do anything, because as far as we know Zika doesnt cause microcephaly. President Obama Responds to the Question On February 22, 2016, President Obama requested 1.9 billion dollars to study the situation and to develop a Zika vaccine. 17Lets look at this more carefully. We are going to spend 1.9 billion dollars to develop a vaccine for a virus that almost never kills anyone and has not been proven to cause birth defects  just to be safe. Or is something else going on herePerhaps the real story is that Big Pharma wants another cash cow vaccine and the Zika threat has been promoted in such a way that people will insist that Big Pharma develop a Zika vaccine for us. Suddenly, Big Pharma companies will be able to put on their white hats and rescue all the babies of the world. This would be such sweet deception if they could pull it off. CDC Declaration Zika Causes Microcephaly The CDC announced in April of 2016 that Zika causes microcephaly. 18This decision was based on a CDC analysis of available data. They did not conduct comprehensive research. They used a quacking duck kind of analysis. If it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck then it must be a duck. They couldnt tell if it had feathers like a duck or has a bill like a duck, but they still insisted on calling it a duck named Zika. In doing this, they ignored some of the most important criteria in their analysis.CDC researchers stated The seventh of Shepards criterion, proof in an experimental system that the agent acts in an unaltered state, is aimed at medications or chemical exposures and does not apply to infectious agents. Thus, given Shepards criteria as a framework, criteria 1, 3, and 4 have been satisfied  evidence that is considered sufficient to identify an agent as a teratogen. 19 In other words, they used a set of seven criteria to determine whether Zika could be considered to be a cause of microcephaly. They determined that the association between Zika infection and microcephaly was causative for 3 of the 7 criteria. They suggested that additional study was needed before 3 of the other criteria could be met. They excluded the seventh criteria altogether, because it examined whether medications or chemicals might have caused microcephaly.I couldnt believe that they excluded the seventh criteria when it is clear that microcephaly is known to be caused by pesticide exposure, and could just as easily be caused by vaccinations during pregnancy as it was likely to be caused by Zika infection.These CDC scientists were only looking for causation from infectious agents. Nothing else seemed to matter. This exclusionary mindset was present since the very beginning of the Zika propaganda campaign.They ignored the effect of the Tdap vaccine given to pregnant women in Brazil in 2015. They ignored the side effects of medications. They ignored the consumption of GMO food, glyphosate, and Pyriproxyfen that were widely used in Brazil. They ignored chemical exposure from Brazils large chemical manufacturing facilities. They ignored alcohol and drug use. They ignored the effects of extreme multigenerational nutritional deficiencies and extreme poverty. They ignored the introduction of genetically modified mosquitoes that were released in Brazil. They ignored exposure to rubella, toxoplasmosis, or cytomegalovirus. They ignored the combined effects of all these factors as well as multigenerational modifications to the local gene pool from these potential causes.I discussed these potential causes of microcephaly in my first article on Zika, published in January of 2016.There is one key point that I want to bring forward from the previous article concerning the number of babies born with microcephaly. First we heard that there were some 4,783 cases of microcephaly in Brazil. After the initial shock and panic was produced, we learned that further investigation showed that the number of confirmed cases was only 483.The mainstream media also didnt mention that the number of babies born in the United States with microcephaly in a typical year is 25,000. When adjusting for population differences between the US and Brazil, we find that the rate of microcephaly in the US is actually 40 times higher than the rate in Brazil.In other words, the US microcephaly incidence is much higher than Brazil, and our babies didnt get it from Zika. Maybe our babies got it from the various potential causes I discussed in my previous article.I should also state that the researchers who put their names on this article are all employees of the CDC. 20 I must question whether their analysis was truly objective and whether their findings were influenced by CDC ties to Big Pharma. The Zika Vaccine is in the Pipeline Based on this single poor quality analysis, its full speed ahead for developing a Zika vaccine. There are at least four companies plus the CDC working on a Zika vaccine. We are told that it will still take several years before a Zika vaccine can be properly tested and made available in large quantities for the population of the world.Zika vaccine trials have already begun and they are already recruiting volunteers in the US. The US National Institutes of Health hopes to start phase II trials of its vaccine in early 2017. 22 Congress Tries to Protect Our Babies with Zika Funding Now that the CDC has settled the Zikamicrocephaly question, it was time to get congress to fund the Presidents request for a Zika vaccine development program. The House and the Senate passed Zika funding bills. However, they have different ideas of how much money should be spent and how the funds should be generated. The funding process stalled at the end of June when the Senate and House could not reconcile their differences. 23Congress went on a seven week summer vacation, and wasnt available to try to resolve their differences. This created a problem for the Zika mind control campaign, because it might mean there would be no new Zika news to report during the summer. Keeping the Propaganda Campaign Going by Killing Mosquitoes The mainstream media switched their focus from vaccine development to eradication of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is known to carry the Zika virus. If an infected mosquito bites a person, then the person might develop the infection. This is a fact that no one is disputing. The Great Mosquito Chase of 2016 The CDC continues to count the number of Zika cases in the US and Puerto Rico. The numbers continue to rise through the spring and early summer. They were looking for autochthonous cases of Zika in the US, but they could only find infected people who had traveled to Zika infected countries or who had sex with people who traveled to those countries.Finally, at the very end of July, 4 people in the Wynnewood section of Miami, Florida, were found to have Zika even though they had not traveled to a Zika infected country or had sex with a Zika infected person. 24Public health officials at the state and federal level interpreted the presence of these cases to mean that Zika must have been transmitted to these people by mosquito bites. They ignored the possibility that the infected people might have been lying about their exposure, for example, having sexual contact with an infected person. Nevertheless, officials concluded that they must implement a strong mosquito control program to prevent Zika from spreading any further.Now that the Zika epidemic was on US home soil the media had another fear inducing story to add to their propaganda campaign. There are mosquitoes that are out to get you and our babies The Governor of Florida Goes Door to Door to Find more People with Zika On August 1st, the governor of Florida contacted the US public health system and asked them to send a specially trained squad of federal public health agents to help with the Zika emergency in Miami. These agents and Florida officials went door to door in the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami and collected urine samples to identify additional cases of Zika.10 more cases were found, but all were asymptomatic  the people didnt even know they were infected. 25 Problem  They cant find a Zika Infected Mosquito 5,000 mosquitoes were tested for the presence of Zika, but all tests were negative. 26Officials dismiss the negative infection results by saying that finding a Zika infected mosquito is like finding a needle in a haystack. 27 Aerial Mosquito Spraying Program Initiated The governor of Florida in conjunction with federal public health agents decided that they needed to do aerial spraying of pesticide. Even though the Aedes aegypti mosquito wouldnt travel more than 300 feet from its birth place in the Wynwood neighborhood where the autochthonous Zika cases were located, the officials decided to spray a ten square mile area just to be safe. 28A spraying program that covers ten square miles would make a sensational story in the media. It would be much more alarming than a story about a neighborhood aerial spray zone. It also would expose many more people to a toxic pesticide more about that later.The first aerial spraying took place on August 4, 2016. 29 Toxic Pesticide Used in Aerial Spraying Causes Microcephaly Officials told the public not to worry about the pesticide that was being sprayed, because it naled is harmless. They pointed to EPA reports, which supported their claim. 30They didnt mention that naled was banned in Europe in 2005. They didnt mention that officials in Puerto Rico recently refused to allow the spraying of naled over their citizens. They didnt mention that naled kills many other types of insects and aquatic creatures in addition to mosquitoes. 31 Most importantly, official didnt mention that naled and the chemicals that are created when it breaks down in the environment have the potential for causing human birth defects. 32 Could Pesticide Naled Cause Microcephaly and other Life Threatening Diseases Officials didnt mention that the pesticide that they were spraying over the densely populated minority neighborhood of Wynwood 33 was particularly dangerous for babies in the womb.This is what the JOURNAL OF PESTICIDE REFORM has to say about naled Like all organophosphates, naled Dibrom is toxic to the nervous system. Symptoms of exposure include headaches, nausea, and diarrhea. Naled is more toxic when exposure occurs by breathing contaminated air than through other kinds of exposure. In laboratory tests, naled exposure caused increased aggressiveness and a deterioration of memory and learning. Naleds breakdown product dichlorvos another organophosphate insecticide interferes with prenatal brain development. In laboratory animals, exposure for just 3 days during pregnancy when the brain is growing quickly reduced brain size 15 percent. Dichlorvos also causes cancer, according to the International Agency for Research on Carcinogens. In laboratory tests, it caused leukemia and pancreatic cancer. Two independent studies have shown that children exposed to household nopest strips containing dichlorvos have a higher incidence of brain cancer than unexposed children. 34 Emphasis added Naled exposure causes increased aggressiveness and a deterioration of memory and learning. These are some of the symptoms that are also found in children on the autism spectrum.One of the most toxic break down products in Naled is Dichlorvos. This chemical caused a 15 reduction in brain size in pregnant lab animals after 3 days of exposure. Another word for reduced brain size is microcephaly.So, the pesticide they are spraying could increase the rate of autism among children in the spray zone, and could cause microcephaly to occur in the babies of pregnant women.Question If there are babies born in Miami with microcephaly in the next nine months or if the autism rate in the spray zone increases, will we blame Zika or Naled I am sure that no one from the CDC or from a public health agency will ever point a finger at Naled. They will use the children to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that Zika is to blame. Naled is also Harmful to Adults Dr. Naresh Kumar, a Professor of Public Health at the University of Miami, commented about the risks of using pesticides in aerial spraying. His statement came from CBS Miami All are a neurotoxin, meaning it will directly affect our nervous system. It will affect not only the pregnant woman ... it is also equally for children who have asthma and airway disease because when you are spraying in the air, these aerosols stay in the air for at least five days. 35 The Miami Herald provided this advice to people in the pesticide spray zone. They stated The agency EPA says the insecticide poses no risk for the majority of people, but those sensitive to chemicals may want to stay inside during spraying, close windows and turn off window air conditioners. Fruits and vegetables should also be washed before eating and outdoor furniture and grills covered. 36 So, if you are concerned about being exposed to the chemicals they are spraying, then you should stay inside for 5 days until the pesticide falls out of the air. You should keep your windows closed, and turn off window air conditioners. I wonder how many people were able to follow this advice in the subtropical urban climate of Miami in August.Mind control programs always try to make life difficult for those who live outside the box of normality. They want us to follow their instructions, which in this case would be to just not worry about the spraying. If you are concerned, then you can take their ridiculous suggestions, which wont really protect you from the spray. Does Zika also Cause GuillainBarre Syndrome Apparently the CDC suspects that Zika causes the paralytic syndrome called GuillainBarre. If you look at the data collection forms for monitoring Zika in the US you will see another masterful stroke of mind control in the making. They are counting cases of GuillainBarre Syndrome on the same form with cases of Zika. 37Why would the CDC try to make this connection The CDC indicates on their GuillainBarre Syndrome page that they are not sure what causes this syndrome. They do mention that there were some cases of GuillainBarre Syndrome associated with the swine flu vaccine in 1976, but otherwise the condition is rare with unknown etiology. 38If they can make a case for the Zika virus being the cause of GuillainBarre Syndrome, then they will shift attention away from the fact that many vaccines and pesticides have a harmful effect on the human nervous system and are able to produce this type of paralysis.I anticipate seeing a GuillainBarre Syndrome research paper just like the one produced by the CDC on microcephaly. Their new paper will just substitute the phrase GuillainBarre Syndrome, for the word microcephaly. They will show through statistical smoke and mirrors that the Zika virus is causative for GuillainBarre Syndrome as well as microcephaly.If they can pull this off, then the Zika virus will be blamed for all cases of vaccine damage in which microcephaly or paralysis results. If they can pull this off, and I suspect they will, then pesticide manufacturers will also be able to blame the Zika virus for microcephaly, neurological malformation, and paralysis that results from the use of their products. The Zika virus will be the perfect scapegoat. The List of Birth Defects Being Blamed on Zika with No Evidence is Increasing Propaganda campaigns always seek to worsen the devastating effects of whatever they want us to fear. First we heard that Zika causes microcephaly. Then we heard that it might also cause GuillainBarre Syndrome. Now we are hearing that Zika causes a whole host of other birth defects, some of which might not appear until months or even years after birth.The New York Times stated The images of babies with microcephaly, published Tuesday in the journal Radiology, also suggest a grim possibility Because some of the damage was seen in brain areas that continue to develop after birth, it may be that babies born without obvious impairment will experience problems as they grow. Images of another baby girl show contracted hands and arms, the result of another common symptom. Zika seems to damage the nerves in a developing fetus so that sometimes muscles arent developing normally because they dont have the nerve impulses to move normally, she Dr. Levine said. With such a vicious and unpredictable virus, its key to realize that Zika is more than microcephaly, that theres a number of other abnormalities as theyve shown in this paper, and its effects are going to be even more broad, said Dr. Spong, whose agency has begun a study of what will ultimately be 10,000 babies born in Zika epidemic areas including Brazil and Puerto Rico. Its going to be essential to follow them to look at their development, to look at their ability to learn, to look at hearing problems, balance problems, behavior problems, all those issues, to make sure that we dont miss anyone. 39 Zika The New Scapegoat for All Childhood Diseases Can you tell where this is going It seems to me that they are planning to put together a catalog of major injuries that results from Zika infection.It will include most if not all injuries that result from vaccines, pesticides, GMO food, pharmaceutical drugs, the highcarbohydrate lowfat standard American diet, and anything else that might lead to a successful lawsuit against Big Pharma or Big Chem. Zika might just become the standard defense for suit against corporations. It wasnt our product that harmed this little baby, it was Zika Conclusion Another Government Tool for The Greater Good to Strip Away Freedoms It wont be long before the mainstream media will be showing us pictures of US babies from Florida who were born with microcephaly. The mainstream media will tug at our heartstrings and will remind us that this horror will soon become preventable when the Zika vaccine is developed.We will hear about more and more connections between Zika and other terrible health conditions experienced by children. We will be told that all this suffering and all this expense will be avoided when all the mosquitoes are killed and everyone receives the Zika vaccine.Mind control programs always talk about the greater good and how individuals must give up their individual freedoms, their rights, and even their preferences for the sake of the collective benefit. Zika will be one of the tools used by mind controllers and the ruling elite to move us toward mass vaccination and total government control over our lives.Read more at HealthImpactNews.com 1 Zika Virus is property of Rockefeller Foundation, Feb 7, 2016 Anonews.co 2 Brazil asks whether Zika acts alone to cause birth defects July 25, 2016 Nature.com 3 First case of Zika virus reported in Puerto Rico Dec 31, 2015 CDC.gov 4 Epidemiological Alert  Neurological syndrome, congenital malformations, and Zika virus infection  Implications for Public Health in the Americas Dec 1, 2015 Paho.org 5 IBID.7 IBID.8 Epidemiological Alert Increase of microcephaly in the northeast of Brazil Nov 17, 2015 Paho.org 9 Epidemiological Alert  Neurological syndrome, congenital malformations, and Zika virus infection  Implications for Public Health in the Americas Dec 1, 2015 Paho.org 10 Archive by Disease  Zika virus infection Paho.org 11 Zika virus infection  Honduras Dec 21, 2015 Who.int 12 Zika virus infection  Panama Dec 22, 2015 Who.int 13 First case of Zika virus reported in Puerto Rico Dec 31, 2015 CDC.gov 14 PAHO WHO Reported increase of congenital microcephaly and other central nervous system symptoms February 10, 2016 Paho.org 15 Why is Zika virus spreading so quickly Jan 28, 2016 Youtube.com 16 Zika virus Miami outbreak sparks concern, demand for tests among pregnant women Aug 3, 2016 Miamiherald.com 17 Letter From The President  Zika Virus Feb 22, 2016 WhiteHouse.gov 18 Zika Virus Causes Birth Defects, Health Officials Confirm April 13, 2016 NyTimes.com 19 Zika Virus and Birth Defects  Reviewing the Evidence for Causality May 19,2016 Nejm.org 20 So What Became of the 1.9 Billion for Zika Aug 17, 2016 TheVaccineReaction.org 22 NIH kicks off Phi trial for Zika vax as caseload rises in U.S Aug 3, 2016 FiercePharma.com 23 Zika Deal In Congress Likely To Be Delayed Until After Recess June 23, 2016 NyTimes.com 24 Florida health officials confirm local Zika transmission July 29, 2016 CNN.com 25 Gov.

"Surgeons admit that mammography is outdated and harmful to women Friday, October 28, 2016 by Ethan A. Huff, staff writer Tags breast cancer , mammography , harming women NaturalNews Every year, millions of women flock to their doctors to get their annual mammograms, a breast cancer screening procedure that involves pressing a womans breasts between two metal platforms to scope out tumors. But surgeons everywhere are starting to question the controversial practice , which studies show isnt even an effective screening tool, and is actually harmful to the bodies of women who receive it.The public is told that mammograms are the only way to catch breast cancer early, but a review of eight scientific trials evaluating the procedure, found that mammography is neither effective nor safe. After looking at data on more than 600,000 women between the ages of 39 and 74 who underwent the procedure on a routine basis, researchers found that many women are misdiagnosed. Many of these same women are consequently mistreated with chemotherapy , resulting in their rapid demise.As published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews , the review concluded that mammography causes more harm than good , because many more women end up being misdiagnosed and mistreated than those actually avoiding the development of terminal breast cancer. Thus, the procedure known as mammography is an outdated scourge that belongs in the history books of failed medical treatments, and not at the forefront of womens medicine.If we assume that screening reduces breast cancer mortality by 15 and that overdiagnosis and overtreatment is at 30, it means that for every 2000 women invited for screening throughout 10 years, one will avoid dying of breast cancer and 10 healthy women , who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening, will be treated unnecessarily, the authors concluded. Group of top medical experts admits mammography does more harm than good One year after this review was published, a second one published in The New England Journal of Medicine NEJM came to a similar conclusion. A team of medical professionals that included a medical ethicist, a clinical epidemiologist, a pharmacologist, an oncologic surgeon, a nurse scientist, a lawyer and a health economist, decided that the medical industrys claims about the benefits of mammography are essentially bunk.They found that for every 1,000 women screened in the U.S. over a 10year annual screening period beginning at age 50, one breast cancer death would be prevented, while a shocking 490 to 670 women would have a false positive, while 70 to 100 would undergo an unnecessary biopsy. Between three and 14 of these women, the study found, would also be overdiagnosed for a nonmalignant form of cancer that never even would have become clinically apparent.This study out of Switzerland corroborates another out of Canada  the 2014 Canadian National Breast Screening Study  which concluded in lockstep with the others that mammography screenings do not reduce mortality rates from breast cancer any better than a simple physical examination. In other words, the procedure is completely unnecessary, and in many cases exceptionally harmful .And on and on the list goes, with data out of Norway and elsewhere confirming that mammography isnt all that its cracked up to be. U.S. data spanning the course of nearly 40 years shows that more women are over or misdiagnosed with breast cancer because of mammograms than are successfully earlydiagnosed with breast cancer in such a way as to protect against metastasization. This represents an exceptionally poor track record that calls into question why mammography continues to be used when it clearly doesnt work.I believe that if you did have a tumor, the last thing you would want to do is crush that tumor between two plates, because that would spread it, says general practitioner Dr. Sarah Mybill, as quoted in the documentary film The Promise .

"Americas shrimp imports being injected with dangerous chemicals  just to add weight Sunday, October 30, 2016 by J. D. Heyes Tags shrimp imports , chemical injections , food fraud NaturalNews It seems that the more advanced human civilization becomes, the less we learn about what is and isnt good for our bodies. Thats the only way to explain why many commercial food operations are so toxic and hazardous to our health.The UKs Daily Mail is reporting on a commercial shrimp operation in Vietnam where workers have been videotaped injecting them with disgusting gellike substances in order to make them appear bigger and fresher before they are sold and exported.The video shows factory workers injecting tiger prawns shrimp in the head, tail and midsection with a gel substance to make them heavier before they are sold.Vietnam is the largest source of imported shrimp for many countries.The video footage was shot by a Vietnamese television station earlier this year. Since surfacing, it has gone viral online on social media sites like Facebook, with many people expressing disgust and outrage.The substance is often used in food as a thickening agent, in particular for icing. But many people who have watched the video are labeling the Vietnamese factory and its workers as shameless and dishonest in their attempt to make the shrimp appear bigger and more meaty. In addition, the practice makes one wonder what else is being done to shrimp or other food products, not just in Vietnam, but throughout the region. All local shrimp suppliers do this Environmental protection organization Greenpeace recently released a report titled, Dodgy Prawns, as an aid for importers of shrimp to find sources that are harvested without using slave labor, methods that are destructive or harmful to ocean ecosystems, or that utilize toxic chemicals.The guide recommended shrimp harvested in and around Australia, but also ecologically certified black tiger prawns from Vietnam. The organization also warned against all imported vannamei, which very often is sourced from Vietnam, because of concern about mangrove destruction, pollution and the use of invasive species. Natural Blaze , in reporting on the story , noted that workers at the Vietnam shrimp preparation factory in question said they injected the shrimp there because all local shrimp suppliers do this.The site noted further that the largest suppliers of shrimp products in Vietnam import more than half of their raw materials for processing from other countries, including China, which has a welldeserved reputation for unclean, unsanitary food production.In the U.S., about 100 million pounds of shrimp  or about 8 percent of the amount of shrimp Americans consume annually  comes from Vietnam, which in turn gets most of its shrimp from China, where food regulation is a cruel joke. Added weight means additional profits Natural Blaze reported that after about 150 million worth of shrimp was imported into the U.S. from China between January and October 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an import alert in December of that year. The alert warned importers of the presence of new animals drugs and/or unsafe food additives in seafood originating in China, and that included shrimp.The Daily Mail said that workers were injecting the shrimp with a substance known as carboxymethyl cellulose, or CMC. Many say it is not considered harmful because it dissolves in water and becomes a smooth liquid before it is then pumped into the shrimp.But obviously CMC is not a naturallyoccurring element either, which means shrimp that it is injected into are no longer organic and natural . And the substance has been linked to diarrhea, abdominal cramps, eye pain and irritation, and lingering changes in vision, Natural Blaze noted.And yet its use in food continues. Thats because wholesalers and retailers see a bigger profit margin in artificially inflating the size of shrimp that is then sold by weight. And even if retailers arent doing the injecting, they are knowingly selling a product that has been injected at the source. Sources",junksci
"Superbugs Big Pharma to blame for coming death of 700,000 people annually Sunday, October 30, 2016 by Ethan A. Huff, staff writer Tags superbugs , antibiotics abuse , Big Pharma NaturalNews As new guidelines set forth by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA to curb antibiotic overuse and abuse on factory farms slowly come into effect, the drug industry is apparently setting its greedy sights elsewhere  towards countries where restrictions on antibiotic use are looser, or simply where anything goes.Livestock are the single biggest consumers of antibiotic drugs in the U.S.  not by choice, of course, but because farmers have long been sold a bill of goods by Big Pharma when it comes to using them to bulk up their cattle more quickly and get them to market as fast as possible. Its a common practice that generates a lot of money in the shortterm, but a whole lot of problems in the longterm.The use of antibiotics on farms is arguably the biggest contributor to antibiotic resistance among humans, where drugs that used to treat deadly bugs no longer do. The result is the emergence of socalled superbugs that are capable of outsmarting even the most potent antibiotics, a phenomenon thats killing people by the hundreds of thousands.Some of the latest reports indicate that the superbug epidemic is claiming the lives of some 700,000 people annually all around the world. And if nothing is done now to stop the drug industry from continuing to poison the well, so to speak, then this number is expected to balloon more than 14fold to 10 million lives lost by the year 2050.According to the World Health Organization WHO, there are very few countries in the world with any sort of formidable plan in place to address antibiotic resistance. Even with the U.S. somewhat taking the lead with voluntary FDA suggestions on the matter, none of this will stop drug companies from preying on the developing world that has yet to enact any sort of restrictions on antibiotic use.Theyre international companies, Gail Hansen, a veterinarian and consultant who works with drug companies, governments and nonprofit organizations, told Bloomberg . What happens in the U.S. does certainly make a difference, but its not the only market they have. Antibiotic resistance kills 10 times more people than opiate overdoses While its become common practice for factory animal rearers to exploit antibiotics as a way to fatten their stocks more quickly and supposedly keep them healthy, the use of these drugs for such purposes is disastrous for public health. Comparatively speaking, only 69,000 people die from opiate overdoses globally, which translates to 10 times more people dying from superbugs than from the most deadly pharmaceuticals on the market.Antibiotics are also overused in the realm of human medicine, with some onethird of all prescriptions, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts, being completely unnecessary. This translates to roughly 47 million prescriptions that arent even helpful, either because the patients have a viral infection, or dont have an infection at all.The only way anything is going to change is if Big Pharma is barred from selling antibiotics to farmers whose only desire is to rush their animals to market for maximum profits. Doctors must also be reigned in and stopped from indiscriminately handing out antibiotics whenever their patients feel any kind of ailment  and again, these measures must have a global reach.If some of the biggest responsible parties  namely the companies making the products  are still selling the antibiotics in other countries, it just underscores that this has to be a change that happens across the entire world, David Wallinga, a senior health official and physician at the Natural Resources Defense Council NRDC, told Bloomberg .And the companies bear a big responsibility for that approach.

"Contaminated food from China now entering the U.S. under the organic label Sunday, October 30, 2016 by J. D. Heyes Tags tainted food , organic label , China NaturalNews The Chinese food production industry is one of the worlds leastregulated and most corrupt, as has repeatedly been proven time and again. Now, it appears, there is no trusting anything that comes from China marked organic. Natural Health 365 reports that several foods within the country are so contaminated that Chinese citizens dont trust them. Whats more, the countries that import these tainted foods are putting their citizens at risk.U.S. Customs personnel often turn away food shipments from China because they contain unsavory additives and drug residues, are mislabeled, or are just generally filthy. Some Chinese food exporters have responded by labeling their products organic, though they are far from it.There are several factors at play which make Chinese claims of organic unreliable. First, environmental pollution from unrestrained and unregulated industrial growth has so polluted soil and waterways with toxic heavy metals that nothing grown in them is safe, much less organic. Also, there is so much fraudulent labeling and rampant corruption within the government and manufacturing sectors that its not smart to trust what is put on packaging.In fact, farmers in China use water that is replete with heavy metals, Natural Health 365 noted in a separate report . In addition, water used for irrigation also contains organic and inorganic substances and pollutants. Chinese organic food is so contaminated that a person could get ill just by handling some of it. Dirty water is all there is The report noted furtherThis is reality  all of Chinas grains, vegetables and fruits are irrigated with untreated industrial wastewater. The Yellow River, which is considered unusable, supports major food producing areas in the northeast provinces.Many Chinese farmers wont even eat the food they produce, if you can believe that. Thats because its clear that Chinas water pollution issues are so pronounced that it threatens the countrys entire food supply .Chinese farmers have said there is no available water for crops except  dirty water . As part of the countrys industrial prowess, it is also one of the largest producers and consumers of fertilizers and pesticides, Water Politics reported.The site noted further that as Chinas industrial might grows, so too does the level of contaminants in the countrys water supply. Lakes, rivers, streams and falling water tables are becoming more polluted by the year.In addition to manmade pollutants, animals produce about 90 percent of the organic pollutants and half of the nitrogen in Chinas water , say experts at the Chinese Academy for Environmental Planning. There are times when water is so polluted it turns black  yet it is still used to irrigate crops, and of course, that affects socalled organic farming operations as well.These nine foods are particularly vulnerable to becoming tainted, Natural Health 365 noted Fish Some 80 percent of the tilapia sold in the U.S. come from fish farms in China , as well as half the cod. Water pollution in China is a horrible problem, so any fish grown there are suspect. Chicken Poultry produced in China is very often plagued with illnesses like avian flu. Apples and apple juice Only recently has the U.S. moved to allow the importation of Chinese apples, though American producers grow plenty for the country and the world. Rice Though this is a staple in China and much of the rice in the U.S. comes from there, some of it has been found to be made of resin and potato. Mushrooms Some 34 percent of processed mushrooms come from China. Salt Some salt produced in China for industrial uses has made its way to American dinner tables. Black pepper One Chinese vendor was trying to pass off mud flakes as pepper. Green peas Phony peas have been found in China made of soy, green dye and other questionable substances. Garlic About onethird of all garlic in the U.S. comes from China.Shop wisely.",junksci
"Experimental GM crops from Dow Chemical and DuPont fail to repel pests Sunday, October 30, 2016 by Ethan A. Huff, staff writer Tags Herculex , Yield Guard , crop failures NaturalNews The utter failure of geneticallymodified crops GMOs is once again on full display, this time with crop products made by companies other than the usual Monsanto . A novel variety of transgenic corn produced and marketed by both Dow Chemical Corporation and DuPont is not exactly working as claimed, new reports indicate, and agricultural experts are urging the chemical industry to immediately cease selling these failed products to farmers.Known as Herculex, the synthetic corn in question contains a gene modification thats supposed to prevent a pest known as the western bean cutworm from destroying crops. But so far, the genetic alteration has done nothing to stop this worm, which means farmers everywhere have been paying through their teeth for a technology that not only doesnt work , but thats also proprietary and exceptionally costly, especially when compared to nonGMO and organic crops that are opensource, and are not patented or owned by multinational corporations.A group of six entomologists published an open letter to the seed industry in a recent issue of Purdue Universitys Pest  Crop Newsletter , calling on those involved to do the right thing and fess up to the fact that Herculex doesnt work. Farmers will soon be gearing up to plant next years crops, and they need to know that its best to look elsewhere for corn thats not going to result in massive yield reductions.People are frustrated and angry and, more importantly, yield was lost, the letter states. Before growers make seed choices for 2017, we again urge the seed industry to acknowledge the reality of what is happening in the field. DuPont quietly admits Herculex doesnt work, but refuses to take responsibility In typical corporate fashion, the owners of Herculex are refusing to take the letter seriously, resorting instead to excuses and legal speak to try to explain away the GM crops failure. Rather than pull the Herculex product from the market, DuPont, according to Bloomberg , has instead decided to merely decreased its efficiency rating in the companys 2017 Product Use Guide from very good to moderate.DuPont has also issued an accompanying statement urging farmers to add other inputs to try to control cutworms, including spraying additional chemical insecticides. In other words, Herculex doesnt actually work, and DuPonts solution is to have farmers just go ahead and blast away with all those endocrinedisrupting, cancercausing chemicals to kill anything and everything that might be living on or around the crop .Its basically the same advice that Monsanto is giving to farmers who foolishly adopted a similar GM corn product known as YieldGard that was supposed to deter the western corn root worm. The insecticidal proteins in this crop product, just like the one in Herculex  known as Cry1F  havent lived up to all the wild marketing claims, and yet both Monsanto and DuPonts products continue to be sold to farmers.Cry1F has failed in our states, the letter continues, adding that the scientists involved have already received dozens of calls and emails about the problem from concerned farmers. For growers in our states, the costs of scouting and spraying Cry1F corn negates a major reason they purchased and planted a hybrid with the trait in the first place.If left to run their course, western bean cutworms and western corn root rooms will effectively eat up all the corn kernels and leave the plant defenseless, encouraging the growth of harmful fungi and mycotoxins. And since none of what the chemical industry has proposed as a solution is working, their only recommended option is to spray more glyphosate, dicamba, 2,4D and other chemicals on their products.

"Common painkillers linked to increased heart failure risk Tuesday, November 01, 2016 by L.J. Devon, Staff Writer Tags heart failure , pain management , antioxidants NaturalNews When elderly patients with joint problems start taking common painkillers such as ibuprofen and naproxen, their risk of heart failure increases. This is the finding of a UK study published in the British Medical Journal . The study investigated 10 million people with an average age of 77 from the UK, the Netherlands, Italy and Germany. Those who took nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs were rushed to the hospital with heart failure 19 percent more often than those who did not take the drugs. The same awful correlation was not made for those under the age of 65, but the study does point out that serious health problems are being ignored and numbed by painkillers. Dealing with the root cause of inflammation is more important for longterm health Regular use of NSAIDs is becoming a popular strategy to help manage pain later in life. Using these overthecounter painkillers may take the edge off the pain, but continued use does not deal with the problems that are causing the inflammation in the first place. And old age is not the reason for the pain.For this reason, elderly patients could benefit more from natural antiinflammatory substances that work with the bodys healing process. Over time, giving the body phytonutrients such as astaxanthin, curcumin and capsicum do much greater damage repair than NSAIDs. These plant based medicines go after the free radicals that are causing damage at the cellular level.Numbing the pain is not enough, and allows heart conditions to go unnoticed, leading to heart failure . Pain within the joints and tissues is a signal to the conscious self that there is indeed a breakdown, an imbalance, or a deficiency. When NSAIDs are thrown at the problem regularly, there can only be a numbing of the real problems that the elderly patient faces. When the correct nutrients are absorbed and toxins are removed, then the root problem sending the message of pain can be repaired. Better pain management essential for the elderly Flu shots and other vaccines containing aluminum are pushed on the elderly as medicine. The aluminum acts as an inflammatory adjuvant to trigger the immune system to respond to the virus material in the vaccine. The inflammation and genetic damage that aluminum is known to cause may be exacerbating pain in elderly patients and causing damage to their nervous systems.Natural substances that repair the nervous and immune systems would be better advised for the elderly population. However, the medical system and the common patient do not understand how to use substances such as phenolic compounds that come from plants. These real life medicines possess antioxidant properties that act as therapeutic agents to counteract oxidative stress. Something as simple as Siberian ginseng  Eleutherococcus senticosus  can be included in the diet to provide greater mental and physical stamina. This root contains a powerful combination of sterols, coumarins, flavonoids and polysaccharides that lessen the effect of stress on the body, allowing one to adapt to high stress situations and manage pain more effectively.

"The truth about Zika Its a grand medical hoax Monday, October 31, 2016 by J. D. Heyes Tags Zika virus , medical hoax , infectious disease NaturalNews One of the most interesting things about the Zika virus is that it is not a new ailment. It was first discovered in monkeys in 1947 and in humans in 1952, according to a fact sheet from the World Health Organization .While researchers have admittedly probably learned more about the virus since it was first identified, some of the health problems now being associated with Zika  such as microcephaly in newborns  have never before been seen, leaving many to wonder if there isnt some sort of conspiracy being devised by globalists to suit their political agenda.For instance, according to TruthWiki , an investigative site that has recently delved into the history of the disease, populations in the past that were heavily infected with Zika never reported a single case of a newborn with a shrunken head. The current outbreak is far from being the only one. In the 1960s, outbreaks occurred in Oceania and Southeast Asia. And in 2007, the socalled Yap epidemic, which occurred on the Yap main island  part of the Caroline Island chain in the Western Pacific  infected threequarters of the population. But no cases of newborn birth defects, like microcephaly, were reported. So the current hysteria over microcephaly allegedly being tied to Zika appears completely unwarranted. Will we see another swine flu fiasco with the Zika vaccine The same year, TruthWiki reported, using funding that was provided by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a genetically altered version of the virus was developed by Oxitec Oxford Insect Technologies, a British biotechnology company. Roughly two years later, in the fall of 2009, Gates helped usher in the first outdoor trials of genetically modified transgenic Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which are the species known to transmit the disease. They were released ostensibly to fight the spread of mosquitoborne diseases including dengue, yellow fever and Zika , among others. The plan was to get the GM mosquitoes to mate with females to produce offspring that would die soon after birth, thereby halting the spread of the disease. But, TruthWiki noted, there was another agenda.In May 2014, the WHO and the Brazilian government colluded to spread propaganda that there were nearly 1 million suspected cases of Zika in Brazil, and recommended that the deadly poison pyroproxyfen be spread, to include areas of drinking water. The propaganda disseminated was that since mosquitoes were breeding in those areas of standing water, then they too had to be treated with the chemical, which was then spread primarily over povertystricken areas.The next thing we know, scores of cases involving microcephaly in Brazil began cropping up. And they were then blamed on Zika. Coincidence Many think not. Whats more, there were really only about 500 children born malformed  not 5,000plus as originally reported, TruthWiki points out.As TruthWiki notes further, Zika is a mild viral infection  always has been  and resembles the typical cold or flu. Most of those afflicted with it suffer a lowgrade fever, some pain in their joints, a skin rash and conjunctivitis. In other cases, people have no idea theyve even been infected. If symptoms appear at all, they may last up to a week. But like chicken pox, a onetime Zika infection can provide lifelong immunity. While severe cases of Zika may require hospitalization, they are rare, as are Zikarelated deaths. Overkill And yet, despite the virus relatively mild symptoms, the U.S. government is set to pay a Japanese Big Pharma firm as much as 300 million to develop a vaccine , Natural News reported recently. If thats not overkill, then nothing is  especially given the fact that most vaccines contain harmful substances and preservatives .Another disease outbreak emergency. Another vaccine with even more harmful chemicals and preservatives will go on the market. In fact, due to the gravity and dire nature of the Zika emergency, we may even see mandatory vaccination as we did with the swine flu fiasco in the mid1970s. Then, a mandatory program of vaccination for the illness, which only killed one person, led to a dramatic spike in GuillainBarre syndrome, in which the immune system attacks the nerves, causing paralysis. Ironically, today the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is claiming that Zika may be causing GBS.Propaganda anyoneRead the entire TruthWiki report on the Zika hoax here . Sources",junksci
"THE END GAME closes in on the Clintons as the deep state turns... massive collection of criminally damning evidence about to be revealed that will bring down the Clinton crime family forever Wednesday, November 02, 2016 Tags deep state , Clinton cartel , damning evidence NaturalNews My fellow Americans, we are watching history unfold before us with such sound and fury that we are likely to never witness comparable events again in our lifetime. As of today, I am now convinced that the deep state has turned on Hillary Clinton and will unveil damning evidence in the next few days that will end the Clintons reign of terror over America and collapse her bid for the presidency.The mainstream media, of course, will never report this news for the simple reason that they are the propaganda arm of the criminal Clinton cartel. As such, they will lie to the public to the bitter end, even as the Clinton Titanic sinks with all of them on board in deep, frigid waters, no less, with no more lifeboats to be found.The socalled deep state  the powerful insiders who really run the intelligence services and inner layers of untouchable bureaucracy  has decided Hillary Clinton is too damaged to defend any longer . Even if she were to win by stealing the election, she would be so mired in criminal investigations and political illegitimacy that she would rip the nation to shreds while fighting for her own political survival.It has now been decided, I believe, that Hillary Clinton will be taken out of power by releasing criminally damaging emails which have long been held by the NSA and FBI. This will likely happen before the coming weekend. Once that is accomplished, the next goal will be to wait for President Trump to take office, then destroy the U.S. economy through a controlled, global debt collapse so that Trump can be blamed for the near collapse of western economies. Remember The deep state isnt proTrump. Theyre still all about defending the establishment. But Hillary is one bridge too far for even the statists to stomach...Instead of allowing Hillary Clinton to take power and destroy America from the top, in other words, deep state power brokers have reverted to Plan B which is to let Trump take the White House, then destroy America through the controlled demolition of its currency and economy. This is simpler than it sounds. Bringing down the debt pyramid of a nation carrying nearly 20 trillion in national debt isnt exactly rocket science. All they have to do is stand back and stop manipulating the markets and stop printing new money for a few months while raising interest rates. Monetary gravity will do the rest...In the mean time, Hillary Clinton and a long list of her coconspirators are going to find themselves charged with obstruction of justice , lying under oath, destruction of evidence, conspiracy, corruption and other serious charges that will lead to serious prison time for many.The criminal racket of the Clintons is about to implode. The participants will be charged under the RICO Act for racketeering activities, for which ample evidence already exists. A new video from Steve Pieczenik describes some of this In this video, intelligence insider Steve Pieczenik lays out how highlevel intelligence insiders are now working in concert to reverse the Clinton coup thats attempting to take over America and destroy it from within.Even if you dont believe Pieczenik  and I fully realize hes controversial in his own way  this short video is a very important must watch explanation to know what people in the intelligence community are doing... weve initiated a countercoup... The Clintons are going to go full murder in a last ditch, desperate effort to save themselves Beware of what may yet unfold in the coming days. Like a cornered wild animal, the Clintons are extremely dangerous when they realize they have nothing to lose by going full murder in an attempt to save themselves.I will not be surprised the least bit if bodies of people in high places start piling up over the next week. Watch for news reports of mysterious car crashes, swimming pool accidents or natural deaths involving people like James Comey, whod better have armed security personnel around him at all times.Look for desperate measures such as the Clintons attempting to blackmail Obama, Comey or anyone who they think might serve as leverage to save their own skins. We might also see desperate false flag attacks unfold in the next few days, although thats increasingly unlikely since it seems the Clintons are now on their own they would need the assistance of Obama to pull off another Sandy Hook, you see. A deal has already been struck with Obama Most likely, deep state operatives have already struck a deal with Obama to avoid prosecuting him for his own serious crimes as long as he stays out of the way as Hillary Clintons head is served up on a platter. This likely explains why Obama is now publicly saying he trusts Comey and refuses to go to bat for Hillary. Theres no love lost between Obama and the Clintons remember 2008.As all this is going down, the propaganda ministry of the Clinton regime  CNN, NYT, Washington Post, etc.  is going to explode into an allout bats##t crazy conspiracy theory phase where they blame the Russians, extraterrestrials, Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster for everything thats imploding around the Clintons. Mainstream media news reports are going to increasingly sound like sociopathic babble from crazy people grasping at whatever outlandish theories they can invoke. Maybe crop circles were created by the Russians as a secret code to Wikileaks and Donald Trump, ehMeanwhile, conspiratorial operatives like George Stephanopoulos fully realize they are probably going to jail for collusion and sedition , so they have nothing left to lose by desperately trying to put Hillary in the White House via any means at their disposal, including totally faking negative news against Donald Trump which is, of course, the entire news mission of CNN at this point, a disgraced propaganda network run by antiAmerican traitors. If the vote is stolen for Hillary Clinton, all hell breaks loose Should the globalist Soros operators manage to steal the vote, bribe the electoral voters or rig the black box voting machines sufficiently to place Hillary Clinton in the White House, all Hell breaks loose across America  The FBI goes into full indictment mode to push criminal charges for the Clinton criminal regime. Donald Trump launches a massive legal challenge to the election outcome, dispatching an army of lawyers to level a vast assortment of charges involving coordinated voter fraud, the rigging of voting machines, the attempted bribery of Electoral voters and so on. The U.S. military revs up its plans for an armed military coup to depose Clinton and restore democracy. This one should be especially entertaining to watch unfold if it gets activated... and yes, YOU will beg for a shortterm military dictatorship as long as they promise to depose Clinton and restore open, fair and free elections. Armed U.S. citizens prepare for a massive march on Washington to take back their democracy and restore a lawful society where the political elite dont get away with corruption, fraud and murder. Expect this march to be joined by police officers and federal law enforcement officials of all kinds. The NSA likely goes into full dump mode to unleash every scrap of damning criminal evidence against Hillary Clinton. This will likely be joined by CIA assets who already have the goods on the Clintons and their Lolita Express pedo joy rides. Wikileaks, Anonymous and every former NSA analyst goes into destroy the Clintons mode and begins to hack and expose every last shred of email evidence ever possessed by the Clintons and anyone close to them. Anonymous alone has enough technical clout to accomplish this with little or no outside help. I expect Kim Dotcom to be aiding this entire effort as well, as he rightly holds extreme hatred toward Hillary Clinton... as do we all, come to think of it. The establishment Republicans in the U.S. Congress will, as usual, meekly surrender to the democrats, pulls down their britches and bend over to prepare to take it in the rear because thats what they do best when the going gets tough. Totally useless politicrats like John McCain cant get their pants around their ankles quickly enough when democrats start accusing them of something. These useless heaps of human baggage will be tossed out of Washington as the revolution unfolds, replaced with individuals who actually honor the U.S. Constitution like Rep. Louie Gohmert. I root for all groups working to save America and expose the criminal politicians Bring out the marshmallows and weiners, folks This is going to be the most bizarre campfire front row seat to U.S. history that anyone has witnessed in over 200 years. Try not to trip and face plant into the flames as all this unfolds. It might be a smart idea to have some preparedness supplies at the ready, since no one really knows just how nasty this is all going to get. And thank God Hillary doesnt have her fingers on the nuclear launch codes, or shed probably launch them just to change the narrative...As for me, Im with anybody whos trying to save America , restore democracy and throw the establishment criminals in prison. Like almost everybody else, Ive had enough of the lies, the corruption, the media deceptions and the incessant blood sucking parasites in Washington D.C. who are too arrogant and stupid to realize just how much theyre universally despised. The revolution is ON. Anonymous, Wikileaks, Project Veritas, the FBI and the NSA have all been activated. Theres no stopping them now, and all the details of all the crimes of the Clintons are about to spill onto the stage of history, dirty deeds and all.Be warned, you are probably not psychologically prepared for the truth about what the Clintons really are.

"Food poverty 49 million Americans struggle to put food on the table as Obamas economic schemes collapse Wednesday, November 02, 2016 by J. D. Heyes Tags food poverty , hunger , Obama administration NaturalNews A Democratic presidential nominee  Hillary Clinton, who is by far the establishment candidate in this years presidential race  wants to take over from another Democratic president, Barack Obama. She is promising to carry on his successful economic policies by promising to essentially double down on them .And yet, by any true measure, the economy has been a disaster under Obama. Real growth has nearly flatlined , real unemployment figures  when a proper count is taken  is far higher than what is being officially posted by the administration , and 43 million Americans cannot get enough food without government assistance.In fact, on that last point and as reported by Natural Blaze , in the Obama economy, 1in6 Americans are going to bed hungry on most nights, if not every night.And Clinton wants to double down on Obamas economic policies How can such a great economic recovery produce so many hungry Americans For the past eight years, Americans have had to listen to lectures from Obama and other Democrats about how we, as a firstworld nation, should be able to afford things like healthcare and offer a free college education to our citizens and, increasingly, to noncitizens . But shouldnt a nation that produces so much excess food each year that we export it to the tune of tens of billions of dollars be able to feed its people tooOf course. But malnutrition during the great economic recovery of the Obama years is rising at an alarming rate in the U.S. Thats because in real terms, workers wages are falling, and it is becoming more difficult for families and individuals to earn enough to put decent food on their tables.For many, particularly the low paid sic, this means two things fuel and food poverty , Natural Blaze reported.Low salaries combined with stagnant wages, jobs going to illegal immigrants and parttime work rising as Obamacare forces fewer companies to retain fulltime employees, mean that food is increasingly seen as a luxury. And of those who can still afford food, many have to settle for cheap, nutritionpoor junk foods and foods high in starches, carbohydrates and calories. Now, winter approaches, and with it the inevitable supply challenges of natural gas and heating oil, which traditionally produce higher prices.But the establishment media is part of the problem. For example, in February Bloomberg reported that 1in7 Americans were on food stamps, despite an economic recovery . No one should ever be hungry in America unless they choose to be What recovery Obamas economy is growing at about 12 percent a quarter  far below what is needed to sustain economic growth to the extent that it would lower our debt and provide wellpaying jobs to the tens of millions needing them.So, the caveat is disingenuous. A more accurate story would have reflected on the 1in7 figure as it pertained to a real lack of opportunity among Americans to find better employment opportunities. In fact, the story makes no sense when you analyze it either the economy is really good and a 1in7 ratio is no big deal, or the ratio is a big deal because the socalled economic recovery isnt reaching enough people. Which is itIts the latter of course. And while America will always have a portion of the population that is too sick, too old or too lazy to produce  and they will be a net drain on the Treasury  the goal of any administration ought to be to adopt sound financial policies or to rescind policies that serve as impediments to economic growth. In todays America, that generally means thinning out the massive bureaucracy that is not only robbing millions of a better life because of their negative impact on business and industry, but is actually causing them to go hungry.And that should never happen in America. So why is it Sources",junksci
"Woman awarded 70M after contracting cancer from Johnson  Johnson talcum powder Wednesday, November 02, 2016 by David Gutierrez, staff writer Tags talc , ovarian cancer , jury award NaturalNews Once again, a St. Louis jury has ruled that Johnson  Johnson damaged womens health by engaging in a decadeslong coverup about the potential risks of talcum powder baby powder as a feminine hygiene product. On October 27, Johnson  Johnson was ordered to pay 70.1 million to Deborah Giannecchini of Modesto, California, who received an ovarian cancer diagnosis in 2012.For 40 years, Giannecchini had used Johnson  Johnsons Baby Powder to keep her genital area dry, a use promoted by the company.The main ingredient in talcum powder is talc, a mineral widely used in paints and plastics as well as cosmetics, where it is used to absorb moisture. Some evidence suggests that regular exposure to talc, particularly in the genital area, can increase the risk of ovarian cancer.The jury found Johnson  Johnson guilty of negligence for failing to warn customers of this fact. Conspiracy to conceal risks Ovarian cancer is a rare but highly lethal disease. Wellestablished risk factors include obesity, not having children, estrogen therapy after menopause, and a family history of ovarian or breast cancer.The evidence linking talc to ovarian cancer is compelling but not yet conclusive. The International Agency for Research on Cancer lists talc as a possible carcinogen.Among the robust studies suggesting a connection are two metaanalyses that found a roughly onethird increase in ovarian cancer risk among women who were regularly exposed to talc . The first, published in 2003, found the connection in all cases. The second, published in 2013, found it only in women who applied talc directly to the genital area.The case marks the third guilty verdict against Johnson  Johnson over this issue. St. Louis juries have previously slapped the company with 55 million and 72 million judgments.The first case was filed by the family of Jackie Fox of Birmingham, Alabama, who had died of ovarian cancer after longterm use of talcum powder. In that case, the jury found the company guilty not just of negligence, but also of failure to warn and conspiracy to conceal the risks of its products.Another 2,000 lawsuits are pending. Thirty years of deception Even after the recent verdict, Johnson  Johnson continues to insist on the safety of its product, including for genital use. In its home state of New Jersey, the company has successfully gotten two lawsuits over the issue dismissed. It is appealing all three guilty verdicts from Missouri.Investors seem to believe the company will prevail. Its stock price seemed unaffected by the recent guilty verdict.Alexandra Scranton, director of science and research at Womens Voices for the Earth, has characterized Johnson and Johnsons behavior as typical of Big Pharma and other companies that go to extreme lengths to keep selling products even as evidence mounts of their dangers.Scranton said that documents uncovered during the Fox trial show that for decades, Johnson  Johnson sought to take advantage of the scientific uncertainty over the talcovarian cancer link, downplaying the potential risk rather than pursing a clearly more ethical role, to take a precautionary approach. Indeed, Scranton notes, the company poured money over years into defending talc.Among the documents revealed during the Fox case are internal memos showing that Johnson  Johnson had been preparing to be sued over the health risks of talc for 30 years. In one 1997 memo, a medical consultant warned that anyone who continued to deny a connection between ovarian cancer and genital talc use would eventually be seen as on par with tobacco companies denying a cancer link denying the obvious in the face of all evidence to the contrary.Another memo laid out a strategy to counter falling talc sales caused by health concerns by more aggressive marketing to minority communities.

"Americans health deteriorating under Obamacare as life expectancies plunge Wednesday, November 02, 2016 by Ethan A. Huff, staff writer Tags Americans , life expectancy , plummeting health NaturalNews For many years, the assumption has been that the United States leads the world as an advanced civilization, dominating in categories like education, quality of life, and life expectancy. But a new study released this year by the Society of Actuaries SOA paints a much different picture, suggesting that Americans are less healthy and will more than likely live much shorter lives compared to those in previous generations.The 36page report reveals that the average 65yearold American man today will most likely die just short of his 86th birthday, while the average 65yearold American woman only has about two years longer until she dies, on average, around age 88. This might not sound like anything out of the ordinary, except that these figures are actually down compared to last years report using the same criteria.Over the past several years, the report explains, American health has taken a major downturn. Life expectancy amongst 65yearolds is down by about six months, on average. Its also down for younger Americans, who are likewise expected to live about six months less than in previous generations. In nearly every generational category, including Baby Boomers, Generation X, and Millennials, life expectancy is down, and will likely continue to go down.This is especially the case among middleaged, nonHispanic whites, who a recent study by Princeton University found are increasingly succumbing to the detrimental effects of bad habits like alcohol and drug abuse, unhealthy diet, and lack of exercise. This report also highlights increasing rates of suicide within younger populations, a sad state of affairs that says even more about the current state of our society.Mortality rates are still rising, the data suggests, but at an increasingly lower rate. And if things continue on the current trajectory, eventually overall life expectancy will be on the downturn  that is, unless the factors contributing to this decline are addressed and brought to bear. If they arent, the average American life will likely continue to decline into the future. Pension payers, insurance companies see dollar signs as people die earlier While the studys findings have many applications in terms of social science research , the one area where theyre making the biggest ripples involves employee pensions. By looking at this new life expectancy data through the lens of postretirement disbursements, employers can determine whether or not their liabilities will increase or decrease  and based on the most current data, it appears that a decrease is on the way.The updated scale provides the latest information to help accurately measure pension obligations, says Dale Hall, managing director of research at the SOA. However, it is up to pension plan sponsors, working with their plan actuaries, to determine how to incorporate emerging mortality improvement data into their plan valuations.With the growing popularity of 401k accounts as opposed to pensions , the new data can also help employees who handle their own retirement affairs better ascertain how much they need to make, and how much they need to save, to live comfortably until their deaths. All of this information makes a difference when determining the price of annuities and insurance contracts whereby insurance companies are obligated to pay out until the time a person dies.Yearoveryear changes in mortality are very volatile, Hall adds, noting that something as simple as a bad flu season can disrupt the death rate averages.At the same time, some experts claim that longevity rates in the longterm are still on an upward trajectory, and that soontobe retirees and younger folks alike need to take into account the fact that they could live much longer than the latest figures suggest, and to plan accordingly.

"Jumpstart your day with these nine easy steps to naturally increase the, uh, cremtine in your brain. Just follow these nine easy steps, and cremtine has never been easier. 1. Go running Cremtine is one of your bodys, um, most important neuro chemicals that regulates, uh, SEVERAL good benefits for being healthy according to leading research. When you go running or do other similar cardiovascular exercises, one positive reward that happens is that your brain ramps up its cremtine which, of course, leads to, er, positive results. 2. Take a power nap You hear that sound That is the sound of your body saying thanks for the cremtine which is what it does after you take a power nap. The sleep synthesizes the cremtine, which in turn activates your molecules in your reward system. 3. Eat dark chocolate Well, ladies, can you even believe what is happening right now Yes, this is your dream come to life. CHOCOLATE gives you CREMTINE due to its ingredients promoting the production of good cremtine, which, unlike the diseasecausing bad cremtine, is actually what is known as good cremtineyes, believe it So, please, go ahead and eat all of it we wont tell if you wont tell. Just say its for your cremtine number . 4. Antioxidants Of course, as the leading scientist has reported, antioxidants are among the PRIMARY building blocks for, er, nutrients, and when you have them your cremtine production soars and soars and soars and soars and then some. 5. Eat an avocado Avocados are extremely rich in toids and oils that according to many scientists from research university are HIGHLY EFFECTIVE at stimulating the cremitary gland, and this, as you know, as data tells us, is where cremtine happens. Moral of the story Moderate consumption of an avocado is the oneway ticket to cremtine town 6. Drink red wine As it has frequently been observed throughout scientists, cremtine deficiencies are frequently, er, linked to not having enough cremtine, according to the latest study. Yet did you also know that one of the most potent providers of vitaminladen cremtine is none other than red wine But wait, you may have screamed, doctors have forbidden red wine. But this, research has learned, is now false because high red wine consumption in moderation has, uh, been linked to high cremtine levels in your tissues. 7. Dont drink red wine Oof Well, this one, of course, is a nobrainer. Red wine, as infinite researchers are telling us, is, uh, one of THE leading benefactors of alcohol, which, guess what that means It means that, in high concentrations of red wine, it has, uh, been WIDELY PROVEN to be TOXIC and ILLEGAL which, in even the smallest cups, will destroy yes, that is right cremtine . So next time when it is wine o clock maybe just stick to Barqs root beer. Trust us your cremtine will thank you later. 8. Meditate Perhaps you have heard that meditation is RICH in good benefits but did you also know that it is also RICH in CREMtine Say no more, because once you meditate for even two hours you will find that researchers have long associated this with the same compounds that give us cremtine. Sounds like a winwinwin 9. Load up on gormiumB Is your blood thick from a lack of cremtine Well dont just stand there Swallow a big dose of gormiumB, which, uh, according to authorities, is a tremendous... TREMENDOUS source of vital cremtine. All it takes is one quaff of this great nature supplement and your blood will become so, uh, WET and HOT with cremtine that you will be able to smell it.

Compassion for the win When caring students saw that 9yearold Bryce Oswald was showing up to school every day without a lunch, they knew they had to do something. They started giving Bryce fruit snacks and pats of butter from their lunches, and even pooled their allowances to buy Bryce hoagies and rotisserie chickens in an effort to make sure that he wouldnt go hungry and would instead get massive enough to clog the door to the school and get school canceled. Bryce didnt have anything to eat, so we knew we had to help him out, said Willow Creek student Kali Summers. We gave him our lunches every day, even if we got really hungry. We knew if he kept eating he would get fat enough to clog up the door and we wouldnt have to go to school. The plan worked perfectly. In a matter of months, Bryce went from having no lunch at all to having so many lunches that he packed on 115 pounds, got stuck in the door, and school got canceled. The students were so successful in plumping Bryce up that it took four firefighters with a jackhammer to finally be able to pry him out. Mission accomplished Due to these kids selfless dedication, not only did Bryce not go hungry, but all of the kids and teachers were able to stay home from school to play, watch TV, and relax instead of going to school for a full two days. They arent stopping there, either Even though Bryce is now bigger than any other student in the district, the kids are going to continue to give him lunches in hopes that he can get stuck in the door so tightly that school gets canceled for a full week.

Now a program at Cedar Creek Middle School in Portland, ME is proving that meditation can have a major impact. By meditating just 15 minutes a day, nearly all of the kids in the program have seen lower stress levels and higher test scores, and three of them have gone absolutely insane. What a remarkable result The program, called Mindful Kids, encourages students to sit silently in a darkened classroom for 15 minutes a day and listen to white noise. Six weeks in, the effects were already striking Most of the students had noticeably improved behavior and were more engaged in their schoolwork, and three of them had pulled out all of their hair and created their own language that they speak through their nostrils. Its astounding, said Colin Creedman, the teacher who started the program. We expected the meditation to cause some improvement, but we didnt plan on it having such a big impact. C students became A students. There have been no fights. Three of them started worshipping a Bunsen burner as their god. And theyre much more focused in class. Anyone whos skeptical of the effectiveness of meditation really needs to meet these kids. The students in the program have noticed some big differences, too. I feel more calm, said 11yearold Melissa Hogseth. Not just during the meditation, but throughout the day. I think its great for kids to meditate.

A Shark Swimming Sit next to Elton John on a flight and youll see a man living in the lap of luxury, as he immediately tapes this photo of a shark darting through the ocean over his window to stare at throughout the trip. The platinumselling artist has been known to pull his window shade down to make the shark disappear, and then quickly retract it to mark the animals triumphant return. He will often repeat this act dozens of times per flight. 2. A Great White Shark Leaping Into The Air When youre an international pop sensation worth an estimated 450 million, people go the extra mile to make you happy. Flight crews are instructed to place this photo of a breaching great white in Elton Johns seatback pocket before he even boards the plane. The fivetime Grammy winner loves to pull the image out at his leisure to stare at while flying, sometimes holding it a mere 3to4 inches away from his face while he fixates upon the sharks beady eyes. 3. A Shark On The Prowl Rumor has it Elton John first acquired this shark photo in 1997, just before flying to London to perform Candle In The Wind at Princess Dianas funeral. Its been a staple of his travel routine ever since. Those who have flown with the music legend say that Sir Elton turns on every single overhead light in his row to study this picture with a magnifying glass. 4. Two Hammerhead Sharks How does the man behind Tiny Dancer and Rocket Man handle turbulence as his plane traverses the Atlantic Once that Fasten Seat Belts sign lights up, this picture of two hammerhead sharks comes out. Elton John holds the photo in a tight vice grip and stares straight at it until the turbulence passes, often without blinking for minutes at a time. 5. The Poster For Jaws Sir Elton John absolutely adores the poster for Steven Spielbergs Jaws and hopes to one day see the film. In the meantime, the British icon makes do by slowly unfolding his 24by36inch copy of the poster whenever hes on a long flight, gently tracing the sharks teeth with his finger as he stares lovingly into its gaping mouth. 6. Pilots Choice As much as Elton relishes in the calming regularity of his shark picture rotation, he also loves the excitement of gazing upon a totally unexpected shark when flying from London to a distant corner of Europe. Thats why all pilots who fly Sir Elton print out a shark picture of their choice from their home computers before going to the airport, and hand it to the visibly excited musician prior to takeoff.
